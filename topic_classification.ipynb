      "\"Asia Pacific ICEMR Cambodian Cross-sectional\r\n",
      "Background: In Cambodia, significant achievements have been made over the past decade in reducing malaria-related morbidity and mortality. However, transmission is endemic in 21 of 25 provinces and it is estimated that 58% of the population, or approximately 8.6 million people, continue to live in malaria at-risk areas. The incidence of clinical cases is highest in the north-eastern part of the country, with the highest risk in forest or forest fringe areas of the country, usually found along the borders. It is therefore very important to i) characterize region specific demographic and geographic determinants of (especially asymptomatic) malaria infection ii) determine the relationship between different measures of malaria infection and exposure and iii) implement malaria surveillance and control strategies using this knowledge to optimise the distribution of limited resources to detect as many infections as possible.\r\n",

      "    To determine the genetic complexity of Plasmodium spp. infections within and between populations\r\n",

      "Total Cost (USD): $0.000589, 'title': 'Loan Program to Help Small Businesses in Unincorporated Area', 'text': '\\nThe County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a $5 million loan program to help small businesses in the unincorporated area that have suffered losses because of COVID-19. The program will be overseen by the San Diego Foundation.\\nThe loans are intended to allow these businesses to stay afloat and recover quickly once the state’s stay-at-home health order is lifted.\\nUnincorporated area businesses that employ fewer than 50 people may qualify for the no- or low-interest loans. Applicants could request up to $50,000 and pay no more than 2% interest for a term of up to two years. Businesses that can retain and create jobs will have priority.\\nThe board action allows staff to set up an agreement with the San Diego Foundation to distribute the funds. The Foundation will ensure the loans are covered by the State of California Small Business Loan Guarantee Program or a comparable program.\\nLoans paid off within 60 months are returned to the County as well as 95% of any defaulted loans.\\nApplications for the loans could begin as soon as next month.\\n '}]\n"

0,"2 Flu Deaths and Nearly 1,400 Cases Reported Last Week","Two additional flu deaths were reported in the region, bringing this season’s total to 10, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/2-flu-deaths-and-nearly-1400-cases-reported-last-week/,2020-01-02T09:02:07-08:00,"
Influenza cases reported last week in San Diego County rose to a season high of 1,390 cases, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Two additional flu deaths were identified in the region, bringing this season’s total to 10.  A 77-year-old man died Dec. 24, and a 75-year-old man died Dec. 21. Both died from influenza A, and both had underlying medical conditions.
“The significant jump in new cases indicates that influenza is widespread in the county, just like it is in the state and throughout most of the nation,” said Thomas R. Coleman, M.D., M.S., acting County public health officer. “Our condolences go out to the families and friends of those who died from influenza this year.”
The number of lab-confirmed cases rose 643 last week when 1,390 cases were reported, compared to 747 cases the previous week.
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Dec. 28, 2019, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 5% the previous week, which was revised downward from 7% from the prior report)
Total influenza deaths to date: 10 (compared to 9 at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,838 (compared to 1,729 last season)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

The new year is always a time to reflect on where you’ve been, where you’re headed and how to improve yourself. Consider protecting your pets as an area to improve in for this new decade.
How can this be done when you feel you are already a good pet owner? See the seven resolutions below from County Animal Services. Perhaps, you’re halfway there already.
Seven pet owner resolutions for the New Year:

Make sure both your dog and cat are vaccinated against rabies.
License your dog.
(Those first two are legally required for dogs.)
Register your dog and cat with Finding Rover, which can help you find them if they’re lost.
Microchip your dogs, cats and rabbits. If they’re already microchipped, make sure your information is current.
Get your dog and cat spayed or neutered.
Create a disaster plan for your pets.
Give your pet attention. Play catch with your dog, toss a toy to your cat, and give any furry or feathered friend the appropriate interaction. And have fun!

Appointments aren’t necessary for microchips or rabies vaccinations. Stop by at either one of the County’s two shelter locations in Carlsbad or Bonita during normal business hours. They’re open from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. For general information about County Animal Services, visit www.sddac.com.

County officials held a grand opening Saturday for the Sweetwater Bike Park, a first-of-its-kind installment for County Parks offering a variety of bike trails and special skills courses.
Professional bike riders burst through a giant red ribbon banner and showed kids, and adults, what they could aspire to when on the specially designed course.
The $1.9 million, 4.2-acre park is located at 6057 San Miguel Road in Bonita and is open daily from 9:30 a.m. to sunset. There is no cost for riders who can try out a range of attractions that allow them to improve their skills over time.
The features include four jump lines ranging from beginner to expert, a jump track, a kid’s pump track, a skill zone, two flow trails, a perimeter trail to connect the different features and an entry plaza for group meet-ups and special events.

Live Well San Diego kicked off its 10th anniversary celebration this weekend with a pair of fun activities. The County’s vision for a region that is healthy, safe and thriving was celebrated at a San Diego Gulls ice hockey game and during the grand opening of the new Sweetwater Bike Park.
During their game against the Bakersfield Condors on Saturday night, the San Diego Gulls became the newest Live Well San Diego partner, bringing the total number of recognized partner organizations to 479. The Gulls were presented with a proclamation from the County Board of Supervisors recognizing the organization’s commitment to advancing the Live Well San Diego vision.
“We were proud to welcome the San Diego Gulls as a Live Well San Diego partner during Saturday’s game. It was great so many County of San Diego employees were in attendance,” said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher. “Athletes and sports teams understand the importance of living a healthy lifestyle and set a great example for all of us. The hard work and dedication the Gulls make daily to Live Well San Diego should be an inspiration to us all. It’s great to have them on the Live Well team.”
Launched in 2010, the Live Well San Diego vision was created by the County in response to statistics that found that throughout the nation and locally three behaviors (poor nutrition, lack of physical activity and tobacco use) were contributing to four diseases (heart disease/stroke, cancer, Type 2 diabetes and respiratory conditions) that resulted in more than 50% of deaths in San Diego County.
To address these issues, the County partnered with schools, government agencies, businesses, neighborhood-based organizations and other entities to leverage existing resources to improve the health and well-being of all County residents.
In the past decade, organizations and individuals have shared their knowledge, resources and ideas to address a broad spectrum of community concerns, from access to health care to crime prevention to improving the natural environment.
The 10th anniversary kickoff events over the weekend were the first of many planned for the coming months. The next event will be Love Your Heart on Valentine’s Day, Friday, February 14. For more information on all upcoming Live Well San Diego events, visit the Live Well San Diego 10th anniversary website.

7,Dog Found Starving Now Ready for Adoption,"When Flaco, a 2-year-old fawn colored pit bull mix, first came to the County Department of Animal Services, he was emaciated. But under veterinary care, he has gained 13 pounds and is now available for adoption.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/dog-found-starving-now-ready-for-adoption/,2020-01-06T14:44:56-08:00,"
When Flaco, a 2-year-old fawn colored pit bull mix, first came to the County Department of Animal Services, he was emaciated. But under veterinary care, he has gained 13 pounds and is now available for adoption.
He was found running loose in Ramona in early December and was literally starving.
“He was so severely neglected that he only weighed 33 pounds. So, our staff appropriately named him Flaco, which means skinny in Spanish,” said Dan DeSousa, director of the County Department of Animal Services.
This is how thin Flaco was when found in early December.
“After receiving veterinary care, which included love and attention from the veterinary and animal care staff, Flaco is now at a healthy weight and is just looking for someone to love and feed him.”
Despite everything he has gone through, he is very loving to people and seeks out affection from staff, DeSousa said.
“We really think he should be an only dog. He deserves all the love and attention in the house,” DeSousa said.
Flaco, who is neutered, is available at the Southern Region shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita starting at 10:30 a.m. Jan. 7 for a $75 adoption fee. His ID number is A1868841, his neck tag is S886 and his kennel number is S018. Be aware that the adoption process can take up to two hours. You can shorten that by prefilling out an adoption application at home.
Shelter staff recommend you bring your family so everyone can meet ahead of time. In some cases, people can play with a chosen pet for 15 to 30 minutes to make sure it is a good fit for the family.
Be sure to take a look at all available animals, in case Flaco finds a home quickly, as there are many dogs and cats looking for love in the new year. If getting another dog or cat, shelter staff also recommend that you bring pets with you to meet any new potential addition and see how the animals interact.

Influenza-related deaths in the region rose to 11 last week and more than 1,600 flu cases were reported, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The latest flu fatality is a 51-year-old woman from North County who died from influenza A on Dec. 31, 2019. She had underlying medical conditions.
To date, 11 influenza deaths have been reported locally, the same number as this time last year.
The number of lab-confirmed flu cases jumped again last week, when 1,623 cases were reported, 260 more than the previous week when 1,363 flu cases were recorded.
“Given the high number of cases, influenza activity in the region continues to be widespread, just like it is in other parts of the nation,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The best protection against the flu is getting vaccinated.”
When to Seek Medical Help
Influenza-like illnesses at local emergency departments also rose to 9% last week, compared to 8% the prior week.
People with influenza-like symptoms are crowding local emergency departments and taxing some hospitals.
County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Jan. 4, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 9% of all visits (compared to 8% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 11 (compared to 11 at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 5,434 (compared to 2,133 last season)

9,New Non-Stop Charter Flights to and From Taos Start at McClellan-Palomar Airport,"A new seasonal air charter service is scheduled to start flying Thursday between the County’s McClellan-Palomar Airport and Taos, New Mexico through the end of March.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-non-stop-charter-flights-to-taos-start-at-mcclellan-palomar-airport/,2020-01-08T14:29:50-08:00,"
A new seasonal air charter service is scheduled to start flying Thursday between the County’s McClellan-Palomar Airport and Taos, New Mexico through the end of March.
Taos Air, a private air charter service that operates out of Taos, New Mexico, is scheduled to fly its first 30-seat jet charter flight into McClellan-Palomar at 12:45 p.m. Thursday, and fly back out to Taos Regional Airport at 1:30 p.m.
County officials said that Taos Air plans to fly Dornier 328 jets to and from McClellan-Palomar Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays — or holiday Mondays —through March 29. More information about Taos Air and flights can be found on its website.
The public charter service will provide San Diego County residents the only non-stop airline service from San Diego County to the Taos ski resort area.
Taos Air Director of Operations Joe Zavda, who plans to be at McClellan-Palomar Thursday to greet the services first customers, said the company was very excited about the new service.
County Supervisor Jim Desmond, whose district includes McClellan-Palomar, said, “this is a great new service for residents and the economy of North County. Being able to fly directly from North County to Taos will be a great opportunity for both cities!”
Taos Air also flies charter services to and from Taos Regional Airport and Dallas, Texas, Austin, Texas and Los Angeles.
McClellan-Palomar Airport is one of eight airports operated by the County of San Diego’s Department of Public Works and the only one that operates scheduled public charter flights for county residents.
Because McClellan-Palomar is a smaller airport, passengers can escape the traffic, expensive parking and long security lines at other major airports.
The County has made several improvements at McClellan-Palomar in recent years, including a $24 million renovation in 2009 that added a modernized 18,000-square-foot terminal, parking and a restaurant, “The Landings.”
Parking at McClellan-Palomar airport is $5 a day.

11,New Case of Vaping-Related Lung Injury Confirmed in San Diego,"A new local case of vaping-associated lung injury was confirmed on Wednesday, Jan. 8, by the County Health and Human Services Agency.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-case-of-vaping-related-lung-injury-confirmed-in-san-diego/,2020-01-09T14:01:50-08:00,"
A new local case of vaping-associated lung injury was confirmed on Wednesday, Jan. 8, by the County Health and Human Services Agency.
To date, 43 cases of vaping-associated lung injury have been reported among San Diego County residents, while an additional three cases are under investigation. While there have been no local deaths, all patients had to be hospitalized.
“Vaping-related lung injuries continue to be reported in the region and that’s concerning,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. 
Last June, doctors across the nation started reporting sudden and severe lung injuries associated with vaping. As of Jan. 7, a total of 2,602 hospitalized cases or deaths have been reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories (Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin Islands). Fifty-seven deaths have been confirmed in 27 states and the District of Columbia.
The CDC currently recommends that e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults or pregnant women.  Adults who do not use tobacco products should not start using e-cigarette, or vaping, products.
The CDC has determined that vitamin E acetate and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are closely linked with e-cigarette, or vaping, product-use associated lung injury (EVALI).  CDC recommends that people not use THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products particularly from informal sources such as friends, family, or in-person or online sellers.
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors is scheduled on Tuesday, Jan. 14 to discuss several actions related to electronic smoking device regulations.
Reducing Vaping Among Teens
Last year, more than 27% of high school students in the nation reported using electronic cigarettes in the past 30 days. That figure is up from the nearly 21% who did the previous year, according to the CDC’s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey.

According to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH), vaping devices are the most used tobacco product, and 86% of high school teens who consume tobacco use a vaping device.
Furthermore, of the California teens who consume tobacco products, nearly 90 percent report using a flavored vaping product.
“Most electronic cigarettes contain nicotine and are unsafe for teens and young adults,” Wooten said. “Research has found that nicotine is highly addictive and can harm brain development. If you currently do not use tobacco or vaping products, you should not start.”
For more information about lung injury associated with e-cigarettes or vaping visit the County EVALI webpage, the CDPH Tobacco Free California webpage, or the CDC EVALI outbreak webpage.

Hundreds of San Diego County students have spoken — and drawn and painted and colored — to say that clean air and protecting the environment are important. Nearly 500 students submitted their personal art to the Air Pollution Control District's 2020 Calendar contest.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/students-2020-vision-celebrates-clean-air-on-apcds-new-calendar/,2020-01-10T10:37:33-08:00,"
Call it their 2020 vision. Hundreds of San Diego County students have spoken — and drawn and painted and colored — to say that clean air and protecting the environment are important.
Nearly 500 kindergarten through high school students submitted their personal artwork to the County Air Pollution Control District’s 2020 Calendar contest in October and November to show the importance of clean air and how each of us can reduce pollution.
Thirteen of those works of art, one piece for the cover and one for each month, were selected by APCD judges and now illustrate the district’s official 2020 Calendar that it gives out free to the public.
Each of the students who submitted their art will receive a free calendar and all of the art has been posted on APCD’s website for everyone to enjoy — students, their families and the public.
APCD Director Bob Kard said everyone at the district continues to be thrilled by the numbers of students who take part in the contest each year.
The calendar contest has become increasingly popular, with 476 students submitting personal, original artwork for the 2020 calendar, besting the previous high of 452 students the year before.
“You know, it shows that protecting the environment and keeping our air clean means a lot to them,” Kard said.
APCD printed out roughly 1,500 calendars. People who are interested in getting a calendar can email: APCDoutreach.LUEG@sdcounty.ca.gov.

13,Private School Student First Meningococcal Disease Case in 2020,"A student at Nazareth School San Diego tested positive for meningococcal disease, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/private-school-student-first-meningococcal-disease-case-in-2020/,2020-01-10T15:12:52-08:00,"
A student at Nazareth School San Diego tested positive for meningococcal disease, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
The previously healthy child is currently undergoing treatment at a local hospital. HHSA worked with school officials to identify all close contacts of the ill student to determine if they needed preventive antibiotics. Antibiotics are not being recommended for anyone at the K through eighth grade school who were not close contacts.
“While meningococcal disease can be serious and deadly, it is not spread through casual contact. Therefore, the risk to those who were not in close, direct contact is minimal,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We want to make sure students are up to date on immunizations and are asking people in the school community to look for the signs and symptoms of the disease.”
Symptoms of meningococcal disease may include fever, intense headache, sensitivity to light and noise, stiff neck and/or a rash that does not blanch under pressure. Anyone who develops any of these symptoms should seek medical attention immediately for possible meningococcal disease.
Meningococcal disease is caused by a bacterium called Neisseria meningitidis. It is spread from person to person by close contact. In most people, the bacteria can exist in the mouth and nose and cause no symptoms. However, the bacteria can cause serious and potentially life-threatening disease, generally causing meningitis (an inflammation of the tissues covering the brain) and/or bloodstream infection.
The meningococcal bacteria can be spread through close contact with the ill person, such as living in the same household or sharing oral secretions, such as kissing or sharing drinking glasses, eating utensils, smoking materials or vaping equipment, water bottles, lip balm, lipstick, etc. To reduce the spread of the bacteria, it is recommended that people avoid sharing these items.
Eight meningococcal disease cases were reported in San Diego County in 2019. This is the first confirmed case in 2020.
Vaccines are available to prevent some strains of meningococcal disease. There are two types of meningococcal vaccines available in the United States. Meningococcal conjugate vaccines protect against the serogroups A, C, W and Y strains, while the recombinant vaccine protects against meningococcal B. Both vaccines are a two-dose series.
More information about the meningococcal disease vaccines can be found at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website. The CDC website also has additional information on meningococcal disease.

Poll workers, especially those who are bilingual in any one of six specific languages, are needed for the March 3 Presidential Primary Election. The Registrar’s office is required by federal law to provide bilingual speakers and voting materials to voters who speak Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese.

To become a poll worker, applicants must be a U.S citizen and registered to vote in California, or lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Poll workers must have transportation to their assigned polling location, access to the internet to take an online training and attend a two-hour class in person.
Poll workers receive a stipend ranging from $100 to $175 depending on the assignment and those who are bilingual receive an additional $15 if they are assigned to provide language assistance to voters.

16,"New County Emergency Services Director to Focus on Partnerships, Technology",The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services has a new director at the helm who arrives with experience both in the field and in our region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-county-emergency-services-director-to-focus-on-partnerships-technology/,2020-01-13T12:26:11-08:00,"
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services has a new director at the helm who arrives with experience both in the field and in our region.
Jeff Toney served with the state overseeing its response to the deadly Woolsey Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties and the Montecito mudslides in Santa Barbara County, both in 2018. He even helped with the recovery phase of San Diego County’s Lilac Fire in 2017.
Toney fills the role left open by Holly Porter, who was hired as the deputy chief administrative officer for the County’s Public Safety Group, replacing Ron Lane after his retirement.
Toney, who most recently worked as the Southern Regional Administrator for the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, helped lead the state’s disaster response for 11 counties that included San Diego. He said the overall mission of the agency to help with planning, response and recovery during disasters is what attracted him to this field, and he noted Cal OES has done “a lot of good work over the years.”
Cal OES Director Mark Ghilarducci said Toney was a dedicated leader who “greatly contributed to our success and efficiency during the many recent disasters.” Ghilarducci said he looked forward to continuing to work with Toney in his new position at San Diego County to further “enhance public safety in California.”
In his role with Cal OES, Toney was at the table when it discussed cutting-edge technology in the field, and he has plans to expand these services to San Diego and upping its capability in a disaster.
“I’ve worked with the County (of San Diego) and County OES for many years, and I’ve always been extremely impressed with the office. They’ve already thought three steps ahead of some of the other jurisdictions that I’ve seen so I knew it was a strong office,” Toney said.  “The county level works for me. I’d like to get more local because I think that’s where you can make the most impact.”
With the state, Toney has worked alongside and observed other counties during disasters and has made mental notes of lessons learned and best practices, all of which he’ll apply to San Diego County.
He plans to help create a model for integrating the private sector and non-governmental organizations more in the response and recovery phase of disasters. Toney said the private sector has so many resources to bring to the table and sometimes they just don’t know how to engage government and what role they can play.
He puts an emphasis on communicating with the public, and said it’s important in a disaster to have a source of verified information. Toney hopes to look at enhancing the County’s emergency website information, including adding new mapping technology.
Toney said the biggest takeaway from assisting with other disasters is that it takes all agencies and the whole community together to respond and recover. He plans to meet with partner agencies in his first few months to help establish solid recovery plans.

17,Supervisor Greg Cox Named County Board Chairman for 2020,Supervisor Greg Cox was unanimously voted chairman of the County Board of Supervisors for 2020 in the Board’s first meeting of the new year Tuesday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/supervisor-greg-cox-named-county-board-chairman-for-2020/,2020-01-14T11:39:22-08:00,"
Supervisor Greg Cox was unanimously voted chairman of the County Board of Supervisors for 2020 in the Board’s first meeting of the new year Tuesday.
Cox officially accepted the chairmanship and the gavel from Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who served as chairwoman for a record seventh time in her 28-year career as a County supervisor in 2019. The Board traditionally rotates the chair position each year among the five supervisors.
The Board also voted unanimously to name Supervisor Jim Desmond vice-chairman and Supervisor Nathan Fletcher chairman pro tem.
Jacob thanked her fellow Board members and County staff, saying the County made “real headway” on several important public issues in 2019, including housing affordability, behavioral health, community choice energy and fire protection.
Noting that 2020 will be her final year as a County supervisor, Jacob thanked “the people in District 2 for having their faith in me all these years.”
Cox, in accepting the chairman’s position for 2020, praised Jacob for her leadership over the course of her County career.
Cox will outline his own goals for the County in 2020 when he gives the annual State of the County address at 6:30 p.m., Feb. 19 on the USS Midway in downtown San Diego.
In addition to outlining the County’s goals for the coming year, the Board’s chair becomes the official voice of the Board. They also preside over Board meetings, appoint other supervisors to various committees and field requests from the other supervisors to place items on the Board’s agenda.

18,"County, Tri-City to Build Psychiatric Facility in Oceanside",The Board of Supervisors today voted to enter into an agreement with Tri-City Healthcare District to build a psychiatric health facility in Oceanside.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-tri-city-to-build-psychiatric-facility-in-oceanside/,2020-01-14T13:39:55-08:00,"
The Board of Supervisors today voted to enter into an agreement with Tri-City Healthcare District to build a psychiatric health facility in Oceanside.
The County will contribute $17.4 million to build the 16-bed facility, which will be located on vacant land at the Tri-City Medical Center in Oceanside. Tri-City will operate the hospital.
In 2018, Tri-City Healthcare District closed its Behavioral Health Unit, which provided adult inpatient psychiatric services, and its Crisis Stabilization Unit.
Since then, meeting the urgent and emergent behavioral health needs of North San Diego County became increasingly challenging.
“Getting Tri-City Health into the behavioral health business has been a top priority,” said Supervisor Jim Desmond, whose district includes the hospital. “The biggest winners are the residents of San Diego County, residents and families who count on and rely on the needed behavioral health services.”
Last summer, the supervisors directed the County’s Chief Administrative Officer to negotiate with Tri-City, or other local hospitals, an agreement to provide funding to assist in constructing a psychiatric health facility in Oceanside.
The County will lease the property on which the psychiatric health facility will be built, construct the building, and then sublease the building to Tri-City.
During the term of the sublease, the operating agreement will govern what psychiatric services Tri-City will provide at the facility and how the County will compensate Tri-City for those services. Additionally, Tri-City will repay the County 50% of the construction costs over time through a combination of lease agreements and services.
Improving Local Behavioral Health Care Services
The new psychiatric facility could take up to three years to open. It will complement the County’s ongoing work to review the full continuum of local behavioral health care services and engage in regional collaboration to strengthen the services, transforming them from crisis to chronic care.
One of the first steps is to make sure that people with psychiatric needs have access to services that are in the area where they live and are interwoven with their sources of social and family support. The second is to make sure that most behavioral health systems of care are interconnected so that they are seamless and sustained.
The efforts align with the County’s Live Well San Diego vision for a region where all residents have the opportunity to improve their health, live safely and thrive.

19,"County Bans Sale of Vaping Devices, Flavored Smoking Products","The County Board of Supervisors today voted to adopt new restrictions on the sale and distribution of flavored smoking products, electronic smoking devices and smoke-free outdoor dining in unincorporated areas of the region.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-bans-sale-of-vaping-devices-flavored-smoking-products/,2020-01-14T17:32:38-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today voted to adopt new restrictions on the sale and distribution of flavored smoking products and electronic smoking devices, and also prohibited smoking in outdoor dining spaces, in San Diego’s unincorporated areas.
The new restrictions must still pass a second reading scheduled for Jan. 28. If approved, they will be in effect Feb. 28 and enforcement will begin July 1.
The restrictions were proposed as a response to a spate of vaping-related lung injuries in the nation and the county.
The ordinance passed on a 3-2 vote, with supervisors Kristin Gaspar and Jim Desmond voting against.
To date, 43 cases of vaping-associated lung injury have been reported among San Diego County residents, and an additional three cases are under investigation. While there have been no local deaths, all patients had to be hospitalized.
Last June, doctors across the nation started reporting sudden and severe lung injuries associated with vaping. As of Jan. 7, a total of 2,602 hospitalized cases and 57 deaths have been reported nationwide to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Vaping Restrictions
The ban includes the sale of flavored smoking products, with flavors such as bubblegum, mango, creme brulee, vanilla, menthol and mint. The electronic smoking device moratorium will be in effect for one year, or until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention presents a report on vaping illness that indicates the risks have been properly assessed. The ordinance changes do not apply to certified tobacco cessation products, which are any products approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
More than 60 California cities and counties, including San Francisco, San Jose, San Mateo County and Los Angeles County, have prohibited or restricted the sale of flavored tobacco products or are considering similar ordinances.
The smoke-free outdoor dining is expected to reduce secondhand smoke exposure for restaurant patrons, as well as the service industry employees. It will also restrict smoking near food trucks.
The County’s Health and Human Services Agency is developing a Tobacco Retail Licensing Program, which will be the mechanism that enforces compliance with these ordinance changes. The program will also ensure that shops are not selling to minors, and all retail entities are complying with other state and local laws.
The Tobacco Retail Licensing Program will be brought for Board consideration later this spring.
Reducing Vaping Among Teens
The CDC recommends that e-cigarette, or vaping, products should never be used by youths, young adults or pregnant women.  Adults who do not use tobacco products should not start using the products.
The CDC has determined that vitamin E acetate and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are closely linked with e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI).  The CDC recommends that people not use THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products particularly from informal sources such as friends, family, in-person or online sellers.
Last year, more than 27% of high school students in the nation reported using electronic cigarettes in the past 30 days. That figure is up from the nearly 21% who did so the previous year, according to the CDC’s annual National Youth Tobacco Survey.
According to the California Department of Public Health, vaping devices are the most used tobacco product, and 86% of high school teens who consume tobacco use a vaping device.  Of the California teens who consume tobacco products, nearly 90 percent report using a flavored vaping product.
For more information about lung injury associated with e-cigarettes or vaping visit the County EVALI webpage, the CDPH Tobacco Free California webpage, or the CDC EVALI outbreak webpage.

20,"9 More San Diegans Die from Influenza, Over 2,000 Cases Reported","An additional nine influenza deaths were reported in the region last week, bringing this season’s total to 20, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/9-more-san-diegans-die-from-influenza-over-2000-cases-reported/,2020-01-15T11:41:23-08:00,"
An additional nine influenza deaths were reported in the region last week, bringing this season’s total to 20, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The ages of the new deaths ranged from 45 to 88 years of age. All had underlying medical conditions, except a 57-year-old San Diego woman who died Jan. 3.
Also, there was a significant spike in lab-confirmed influenza cases last week when a total of 2,095 cases were reported. In comparison, 510 flu cases were reported during the same week last season and 2,152 during the 2017-18 season.
“Influenza deaths are very unfortunate, but they occur every season,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It is never too late to get vaccinated, since increased flu activity could last through May, and influenza viruses cause illness in San Diego year-round.”
When to Seek Medical Help
Influenza-like illnesses at local emergency departments dropped to 8% week, compared to 9% the prior week.
People with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.
County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Jan. 11, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 9% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 20 (compared to 16 at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 7,557 (compared to 2,643 last season)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

21,"Cactus Mice Test Positive for Hantavirus, First Local Detection of 2020","Two cactus mice collected separately in routine monitoring in Santee and Valley Center have tested positive for hantavirus, marking the first appearance in San Diego County in 2020 of the potentially deadly virus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/cactus-mice-test-positive-for-hantavirus-first-local-detection-of-2020/,2020-01-15T13:07:38-08:00,"
Two cactus mice collected separately in routine monitoring in Santee and Valley Center have tested positive for hantavirus, marking the first appearance in San Diego County in 2020 of the potentially deadly virus.
County officials said people should never sweep up or vacuum, but use “wet cleaning” methods instead, to clean up rodent droppings or signs of rodent infestation if they find them in their living spaces — homes, garages, sheds, cabins and outbuildings.
Infected rodents shed hantavirus in their urine, feces and saliva. If people stir that dry matter into the air by sweeping or vacuuming, they can inhale the virus and get sick.
Hantavirus is common in San Diego County. In 2019, 42 rodents collected in routine trapping tested positive for hantavirus. There is no cure or vaccine for hantavirus and it can cause deadly infections in people.
However, people are unlikely to be exposed to the virus because its main carriers — wild rodents and particularly wild mice — prefer to live away from people.
Still, County officials said people should be careful to use wet cleaning methods if they find rodent droppings or evidence that wild rodents have gotten into homes, garages, sheds, cabins and other living spaces, and must clean.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and instructions for how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

Thirty-two San Diegans have died from influenza this season and cases increased again last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Twelve new influenza deaths were reported last week, including a 34-year-old woman from East County who died from influenza A and had underlying medical conditions.
Also, 2,292 local lab-confirmed cases were recorded last week. In comparison, 487 cases were reported in the county during the same week last year, and the season-to-date total was 3,130.  The 9,919 cases reported to date this season now exceed the 9,655 cases detected in all of last season.
“The number of deaths and cases being reported are a sign that influenza is not easing up,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Vaccination is the best defense we have against the flu. People who have not gotten immunized should do it now.”

26,Student Interns Help County Promote Evacuation Program,"Nine students at Kearny High School of Digital Media and Design worked together with the County Office of Emergency Services to help develop and create a promotional campaign for a new Neighborhood Evacuation Team program, which would help vulnerable groups in a disaster.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/student-interns-help-county-promote-evacuation-program/,2020-01-22T15:27:52-08:00,"
Nine students at Kearny High School of Digital Media and Design worked together with the County Office of Emergency Services to help develop and create a promotional campaign for a new Neighborhood Evacuation Team program, which would help vulnerable groups in a disaster.
The senior students agreed to take part in an unpaid internship program with the County Office of Emergency Services and met with OES staff weekly to develop two videos, a poster and infographics to be used for social media, presentations or handouts.
The students, five focused on videos and four on graphics, were given two objectives. One was to recruit volunteers who would help people unable to evacuate without assistance. The other was to advertise to those people who need assistance evacuating to make them aware of the program.
Digital media design teacher Joseph Brendan Walsh said the project “had a high priority because it is a serious need for the county.”
Stephanie Clay, English teacher and senior internship coordinator, said, “One of the reasons I think this particular project is so powerful is it was built from a community relationship and the program is about building community relationships.”
Emergency Services provided direction on the messages, and the students gave their creative input.
“I really enjoyed working on my product because that kind of professional straightforward, concise product is something I really want to hone and I’m pretty proud of my product.” said Carson Brumfield, 17, who worked on one of the videos selected.
Another student, Javier Martinez, 17, who worked on the infographic team, said he took the messaging personally.
“My inspiration for the project was my grandparents. My grandpa needs a cane to walk and so I want to make sure he’s prepared,” said Martinez.
Clay said students were guided to research the message and audiences and work with the client directly as they would in any other internship.
The best part of the project was that it was truly student-driven as far as products, Walsh said. Students acted as independent producers while he acted in an executive producer role only to keep the production process on task.
The other students on the team are Angel Adrian, Mary Sutton, Chyna Angobung, Shaun Madott, Andres Perez, Iris Gomez and Ana Castaneda.
Below are the videos produced by the team.

27,County Launches Evacuation Plan Focused on Vulnerable People,"If you needed to evacuate for an emergency, could you just get in your car and go? For some, the answer may be no because they lack transportation, need additional help with medical equipment or gathering items in their home.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-launches-evacuation-plan-focused-on-vulnerable-people/,2020-01-22T15:30:18-08:00,"
If you needed to evacuate for an emergency, could you just get in your car and go? For some, the answer may be no because they lack transportation, need additional help with medical equipment or gathering items in their home.
Studies have shown that during a disaster, older adults or people with disabilities, or access and functional needs have added challenges when faced with evacuation. This information inspired the County Office of Emergency Services to come up with the Neighborhood Evacuation Team program in partnership with the Community Emergency Response Teams throughout the region. The teams are made up of disaster-trained volunteers who can help in their neighborhoods.
People who reach out for assistance will be teamed up with a CERT member who can guide them through the process of making a plan that suits their needs, including working out transportation needs with a caregiver, neighbor or family member.
The County, CAL FIRE/Fire Authority, CERT and school project partners introduced the new program Wednesday at Kearny High School.
“Having faced several major wildfires and other emergencies, some San Diego County residents have told emergency officials of the difficulty and delays they had to overcome to evacuate. This free service that is being offered through the NET program will help people who need extra help put together a plan tailored for their needs,” said County Supervisor Greg Cox. “Once they have a plan in place, if asked to evacuate, it may take them 15 minutes to leave instead of 45 or 75 minutes and that could save someone’s life.”
“This program fits into the national Neighbors Helping Neighbors approach that is crucial in a disaster because we know that in a major disaster, first responders will be tied up managing the threat and it could be up to 72 hours before they could send someone to assist,” said Jeff Toney, director for County Emergency Services. “So, we are glad to be an impetus for this effort where neighbors check in with one another, particularly in rural areas, and especially if a neighbor may have additional needs.”
CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire Division Chief Burke Kremensky said the firefighters looks forward to working alongside CERT members to help residents. He called the program “positive growth happening in our rural communities” and said it could “prove to be a lifesaving benefit to residents.”
The pilot begins this week with information starting to go out to communities in 21 of the unincorporated areas. OES staff additionally partnered with students from Kearny High’s School of Digital Media and Design to help develop and create promotional materials such as videos and graphics to be used in community outreach and on social media. See a related story, Student Interns Help County Develop Promotional Materials for New Program, for more information.
People interested in requesting this assistance, can visit ReadySanDiego.org to be paired with a CERT member.

28,VIDEO: 560 County Employees Volunteer for Point-In-Time Count,The annual Point-in-Time Count is spearheaded by the Regional Task Force on the Homeless and provides a one-day snapshot of people living on the streets or in short-term shelters.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/560-county-employees-volunteer-for-point-in-time-count/,2020-01-23T13:29:16-08:00,"
They typically start working at 8 a.m.
But today, it’s barely 3:30 a.m. and Rubi López, Rosanna Robledo, Veletia Kennedy and Bridget Nathan are already at the LGBTQ Center in Hillcrest ready for their first task of the day: counting people living on the streets.
The group, all office assistants for the County Health and Human Services Agency, is one of several who counted and talked with people experiencing homelessness in North Park, Hillcrest, University Heights and Mission Hills.
The HHSA employees were assigned to the North Park area and, for four hours, they counted people from University Ave. to Upas St. between Arizona Street and Grim Ave.
The annual Point-in-Time Count is spearheaded by the Regional Task Force on the Homeless and provides a one-day snapshot of people living on the streets or in short-term shelters. The results of the count are used to apply for federal and state funding to help people experiencing homelessness and find solutions on how to best serve this vulnerable population.
This year, more than 1,600 people – 560 of them County employees – volunteered for the count.
While in previous years volunteers used paper surveys for the count, this year they used the Counting Us mobile app, which registers the data electronically and captures the exact location of each interaction.
For the 2020 Point-In-Time Count, volunteers used the Counting Us app for the surveys.
The first person they encountered was an older man carrying two garbage bags with recyclable cans and bottles. He declined to participate in an interview.
“I am busy working,” he said while he continued hurriedly walking along Upas St. The counters clicked on the app’s Observation Tally which marked the location he was at.
Less than a block away, they came across Anwar, a 32-year-old from Ethiopia. He said he does not remember how long he’s been homeless but said he is addicted to meth.
People who agreed to answer the questions received a $10 gift cart to Starbucks or McDonald’s and a pair of socks in a bag that also had pamphlet to 2-1-1 San Diego, which can connect people to services.
Most people they encountered agreed to answer all the questions. Some answered just a couple. Others did not wake up.
County employees Rubi Lopez and Rosanna Robledo speak with an unidentified man. “Thank you for your smiles,” he said as he continued collecting cans and bottles.
County employees have participated in the homeless count for the past seven years after Supervisor Greg Cox brought the issue to the County Board of Supervisors, which agreed to allow employees to participate in the count and get their regular pay.
Lopez, who’s been working for the County for two years and volunteered for the count two years in a row, said she decided to participate after Robledo encouraged her to do it.
“This is a worthwhile cause,” said López, adding that on two occasions – as a child and as an adult – she found herself without a stable place to live. “I know what it feels like.”
Kennedy has also been at the County for two years and, this too, is the second year she’s volunteered.
“It’s passion for me to help people who are homeless. So, any opportunity I have, I’ll do it,” Robledo said. “It’s important for us to get an accurate count.”
Last year, the Point-In-Time Count showed that 8,102 men, women and children were living on the street or in shelters, compared to the 8,576 counted in 2018.
Of the 8,102 people experiencing homeless in the region, 3,626 were living in a shelter during the count last year compared to 3,586 in 2018.
Addressing Homelessness
The results of this year’s count won’t be available until this spring. However, the County has multiple programs in place to connect people experiencing homelessness to services they need and to help them find a home.
Over the past few years, the County has made significant investments in outreach, treatment, and housing services. The County has greatly expanded critical services since the beginning of the Affordable Care Act. During fiscal year 2019-20, the County will be spending $712.9 million on mental health and substance use treatment programs and services.
County employees speak with an unidentified man on University Ave.
County efforts include:
Project One for All—Aims to get persons experiencing homelessness that have a serious mental illness off the streets and into treatment. Since the program began, 1,243 people have been housed with treatment.
Whole Person Wellness—People who are homeless and frequently use emergency rooms receive care coordination to help them find housing and engage in services to address their physical and behavioral health needs. Over 600 people have been enrolled with 203 permanently housed with supportive services.
Community Care Coordination –County is working with frequently incarcerated persons with serious mental illness to provide housing and care coordination to improve their outcomes and decrease recidivism.
Supportive Housing—The County has invested Mental Health Services Act housing funds to provide high-quality dedicated supportive housing for clients with serious mental illness and/or co-occurring disorders.
Affordable Housing
The County is also working to address the affordable housing crisis in the region. Some projects include:
Innovative Housing Trust Fund—The County is investing $50 million to build more affordable housing for a variety of special needs populations including persons experiencing homelessness in the region.
No Place Like Home Program—This state funded program will add hundreds of affordable permanent supportive housing units for persons experiencing homelessness that have a serious mental illness in the region.
Identifying Excess Properties for Affordable Housing—The County has also identified six County-owned excess properties that are suitable for development that will include about 800 affordable, multifamily residential units.
Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing—Offers rental assistance to homeless veterans and ongoing VA case management and supportive services. About 1,000 homeless veterans have been housed in San Diego County since the program began in 2009. Additionally, the County spends more than $130 million in U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development funds every year to provide local residents with housing subsidies. Each month, over 10,000 households, which equates to about 20,000 people, receive housing subsidies through the County’s Public Housing Authority.
Together with the Veterans Administration, the County also provides monthly rental assistance to more than 500 veterans and their families through the Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing.

31,County Prepared for New Coronavirus; One Patient Under Investigation,The County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is closely monitoring a new coronavirus causing a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses reported in China.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-prepared-for-new-coronavirus-one-patient-under-investigation/,2020-01-27T21:06:17-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is closely monitoring a new coronavirus causing a global outbreak of respiratory illnesses reported in China.
Working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the California Department of Public Health and the local medical community, HHSA has a plan in place to identify, isolate, test and investigate a possible case of the respiratory illness.
“We’re in constant communication with all the appropriate entities and have a protocol and plan to deal with any potential case,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We are prepared and are conducting surveillance for this new virus just like we do for any communicable disease, including previously identified coronaviruses.”
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in many different species of animals, including camels, cattle, cats and bats.
Rarely, animal coronaviruses can infect people and then spread between people such as with Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome. Many of the patients in the pneumonia outbreak caused by 2019-nCov in Wuhan, China had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients diagnosed with 2019-nCoV have not reported exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring.
Potential Case Reported
Last week, HHSA issued a health alert to the local medical community asking them to be on the lookout for and report potential cases in people who have traveled to the areas where cases of this new virus (2019-nCoV) have been reported.
On Sunday, a potential case was reported to HHSA in a person who travelled to 2019-nCoV impacted areas in China. After consulting with a local hospital, a specimen was collected, sent to the County Public Health Lab for packaging and then sent to the CDC for testing.
The patient is currently in isolation at home and results are expected back from the CDC tomorrow. Currently, the CDC is the only entity capable of testing for this novel coronavirus.
In the meantime, the County has been conducting its investigation to identify people who may have had close contact with the patient and quarantine them.
“The risk of infection for the general public is minimal,” Wooten added. “If you have not traveled to an area where the virus has been detected or had close contact with a patient who tested positive for this type of coronavirus, the risk of infection is very low.”
What to Do if You’ve Traveled to an Impacted Area?
Currently, five airports across the nation are monitoring returning travelers from areas impacted with this new strain of coronavirus.
Patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection have reported mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of:

fever
cough
shortness of breath/difficulty breathing

At this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of 2019-nCoV may appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 days after exposure.
If you’ve travelled to one of the impacted areas and start to develop symptoms, you should contact your medical provider before showing up at their office so that they can take the necessary precautions before your visit.
“If you’ve travelled to an impacted area and start showing symptoms, call your doctor so that they can take the required steps to avoid infecting others,” Wooten said.
Wooten added that people should abstain from travelling to impacted areas unless “it’s absolutely necessary.”
How to Protect Yourself from Coronaviruses
Practice everyday preventive actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
Stay home when you are sick.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.

“These everyday habits can help prevent the spread of several viruses,” Wooten said.

33,"County to Open Psychiatric Hub in Hillcrest, Other Communities",The County Board of Supervisors today voted to partner with UC San Diego Health to open a 60-bed psychiatric facility in Hillcrest.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-open-psychiatric-hub-in-hillcrest-other-communities/,2020-01-28T14:25:54-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today voted to partner with UC San Diego Health to open a 60-bed psychiatric facility in Hillcrest.
The new behavioral health hub is expected to cost $115 million and will be located on a County-owned property on Third Ave. that has been vacant for years. It is one of several hubs that will be opened in the central and northern areas of the region.
“We have something that is really incredible,” said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher who recommended that the empty County property be turned into a behavioral health hub. “The building at Third Ave. truly fills a missing need of a regional hub for the central region.”
The new hubs and network model were announced during the County Health and Human Services Agency quarterly update to the Board on the behavioral health continuum of care for the region. They are expected to reduce the number of emergency department visits and inpatient bed stays due to a psychiatric crisis and to reduce jail stays and homelessness.
Hubs are defined as integrated care environments designed to accelerate transition from behavioral health crisis to sustainable system of continuous chronic care management. Networks consist of a broad array of outpatient services and housing opportunities linked through a regional care coordination system designed to remain continuously connected to service recipients and to reduce episodes of crisis.
The 7.24-acre parcel located at the end of Third Ave. and overlooking Mission Valley has been vacant for over 10 years and used to operate as a County center for abused and neglected children. Adjacent to the property is another County-owned parcel which houses an Emergency Screening Unit that currently serves children and teens who are experiencing a mental health crisis or emergency.
“It’s a great thing for the County of San Diego and for the people who are going to be receiving behavioral health services in the future,” said Chairman Greg Cox.  “This is a home run.”
The services provided at this regional facility could include crisis stabilization, inpatient, residential psychotherapeutic rehabilitation, intensive outpatient, and other related services and programs.
Under the new collaboration, UC San Diego Health will also take over the County’s Psychiatric Hospital for the next five years with an option to renew the lease for an additional five years.
The County Board of Supervisors has taken several actions to enhance, expand and innovate the array of behavioral health programs and services in the region. The actions support the County’s Live Well San Diego vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
These actions have brought together justice partners, hospitals, community health centers and other community-based providers to create systemwide changes to ensure people have access to the appropriate level of psychiatric services to meet their immediate needs and support their long-term recovery.
People needing immediate behavioral health help should call 9-1-1. Help is also available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or visiting www.Up2SD.org.

34,Board Takes New Steps to Address Homelessness in Unincorporated Area,"The County Board of Supervisors today voted to adopt several measures, including sheltering options and expanded outreach teams, to deal with homelessness in unincorporated communities.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-takes-new-steps-to-address-homelessness-in-unincorporated-area/,2020-01-28T15:13:29-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today voted to adopt several measures, including sheltering options and expanded outreach teams, to deal with homelessness in unincorporated communities.
The measures, brought forward by Supervisors Dianne Jacob and Jim Desmond, are expected to help with homelessness in unincorporated areas that have seen a significant increase of people who don’t have a place to live. Recent encampments at Lamar Park, Spring Valley Park and in other outlying areas are the latest reminders that homelessness is a regional crisis.
“Like in the city of San Diego and the rest of California, homelessness has become a huge concern in the suburban and rural parts of our region,” said District 2 Supervisor Dianne Jacob, whose represents East County. “Today’s board vote opens the door to creating a comprehensive approach to homelessness that includes immediate and long-range measures.”
The unincorporated communities of San Diego County have experienced a significant increase in homelessness and its associated impacts in recent years.
A 2019 ruling out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that municipal ordinances prohibiting sleeping or camping on public property could not be enforced by law enforcement without the provision of access to an alternative shelter location.
The new measures call for the expansion of the pool of funding and the eligibility for the County’s hotel/motel voucher program for up to 125 additional people above the current contract, with an estimated cost of about $2.3 million in fiscal year 2019-20, depending on how many people use the program. The yearly costs are estimated to be $5.6 million, however, the need for this level of service is not expected to be ongoing once other recommendations are implemented.
“The value of human life must always be a foremost concern when developing sound public policy,” said District 5 Supervisor Jim Desmond. “Additionally, there is also a value to the quality of life that residents and business owners face daily interacting with homelessness. Taxpayers demand accountability and compassion alone is not helpful. Programs must be effective and accountable.”
In addition, county staff will be looking for properties to lease, license or purchase for safe and temporary emergency relocation options or a shelter, and where health services may be provided. They will also be searching for properties for temporary storage for personal belongings in Spring Valley and/or Lakeside.
The Board directed the review and proposal of County regulations to strengthen the way they address sleeping in public areas such as parks and public right of way and obstruction of public spaces including parks, sidewalks, road right of ways and commercial loading docks, environmentally sensitive lands with endangered habitats, areas near watersheds and areas that present extreme fire danger.
Supervisors also voted to add four deputies and equipment to the Sheriff’s Department Homeless Assistance Resource Team (HART). The team is part of an intensive outreach the County recently piloted involving the Health and Human Services Agency,  Department of Public Works and Department of Parks and Recreation to connect people who are homeless in these communities with services and potential housing. Many have serious, chronic needs and it’s important to break the cycle of homelessness, addiction, medical emergencies and incarceration.
The video below shows a Homeless Assistance Resource Team during one of its outreach events in Spring Valley. It recounts the day’s individual encounters and efforts to get unsheltered people connected with services.

Finally, the County will be exploring the feasibility of expanding the Homeless Court program to include warrant removals for people who are homeless in exchange for participation in a transitional living program.
The County has multiple programs in place to connect people experiencing homelessness to services they need and to help them find a home. Over the past few years, the County has made significant investments in outreach, treatment, and housing services. The County has greatly expanded critical services since the beginning of the Affordable Care Act. During fiscal year 2019-20, the County will be spending $712.9 million on mental health and substance use treatment programs and services.

35,"Flu Deaths Up, Cases Down in San Diego County","The number of influenza deaths in the region increased to 39 after seven additional fatalities were reported last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-deaths-up-cases-down-in-san-diego-county/,2020-01-29T12:05:03-08:00,"
The number of influenza deaths in the region increased to 39 after seven additional fatalities were reported last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The number of lab-confirmed cases dropped last week after several weeks of continued increases. A total of 1,880 cases were reported in the region last week, 380 fewer than the previous week.
“Influenza remains widespread in the region and people should continue taking the recommended precautions to avoid getting sick,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The best way to prevent the flu is getting vaccinated.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Jan. 25, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 8% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 39 (compared to 24 at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 11,778 (compared to 3,493 last season)

When to Seek Medical Help
People with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.
County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

36,"Board Votes to Reduce Greenhouse Gases, Divert Building Debris From Landfills",The County’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to reduce greenhouse gases in the county by keeping a lot more construction debris from unincorporated communities out of local landfills.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-votes-to-reduce-greenhouse-gases-divert-building-debris-from-landfills/,2020-01-29T14:38:30-08:00,"
The County’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to reduce greenhouse gases in the county by keeping a lot more construction debris from unincorporated communities out of local landfills.
The vote would change the County’s ordinances related to diverting construction and demolition materials and supports the County’s Climate Action Plan and its Strategic Plan to Reduce Waste.
The ordinance changes would keep more organic waste like wood and cardboard from rotting in local landfills and creating greenhouse gases including methane. They would also maximize local landfill space by keeping out an estimated 11 times more debris that can be recycled; and allow more demolished concrete and asphalt to be used for new construction.
The changes would apply to construction and grading in the County’s unincorporated communities and take effect April 1 if approved in a “second read” of the ordinance by the Board Feb. 12.
The County’s existing ordinance applies to construction projects at least 40,000 square feet in size. The changed ordinance would apply to projects as large as 1,000 square feet. County public works officials estimate that the change would increase the amount of construction debris kept out of landfills from 4,000 tons a year to 44,000 tons a year.
The County’s Department of Public Works plans to post more information about the ordinance changes on its website if the changes are approved again in the Feb. 12 second read.

A San Diego County resident who visited Wuhan, China and developed a respiratory illness after returning home has tested negative for the novel (new) coronavirus, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the results today and San Diego County currently has no other patients under investigation.
HHSA has been closely monitoring this new strain of coronavirus, currently called 2019-nCoV, which has caused an outbreak of respiratory illnesses in China.
County health officials has been working with CDC, the California Department of Public Health and the local medical community to identify, isolate, and test any possible case of the respiratory illness in a traveler who meets the current CDC definition who should be investigated.

Voters interested in casting their ballots early for the March 3 Presidential Primary Election can now do so at the County Registrar of Voters office located at 5600 Overland Ave. on the County Operations Center campus in Kearny Mesa. Early voting began Monday and will continue from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and until the polls close on Election Day. The office will also be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 29 and Sunday, March 1 for weekend voting.
Over 1.3 million mail ballots were sent out through the U.S. Postal Service Monday, and voters could find them in their mailboxes as early as that same day.
“If you know how you want to vote, grab that mail ballot when you get it, mark it and send it back in right away,” said Registrar Michael Vu. “The sooner we get the ballot back, the sooner we can start processing it so it will be counted right when the polls close at 8 p.m. on March 3.”
You’ll also find something new in your mail ballot packet this year– an “I Voted” sticker.
Mail ballots are convenient for voters who’d rather not make a special trip to the Registrar of Voter’s office to cast their ballots or wait for the polls to open on Election Day. Registered voters can request a mail ballot until Feb. 25.
Meantime, the Registrar is still looking for poll workers, especially bilingual poll workers. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or visit sdvote.com.

42,"San Diego Flu Deaths Increase, Cases Continue to Decline","Eleven additional deaths were reported in San Diego last week, bringing this season’s total to 50, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-flu-deaths-increase-cases-continue-to-decline/,2020-02-05T10:45:55-08:00,"
Eleven additional deaths were reported in San Diego last week, bringing this season’s total to 50, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The ages of the new flu deaths ranged from 53 to 80 years of age and all had underlying medical conditions.
The number of new lab-confirmed influenza cases dropped again last week, a sign that flu activity might be easing in San Diego. A total of 1,702 cases were reported in the region last week, compared to 1,884 the previous week.
“Of the 11 influenza deaths reported last week, only two occurred last week,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The fact that flu cases continued to decline could be a sign that influenza has peaked in San Diego. However, influenza cases are reported year round and we could see case increases in the weeks to come.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Feb. 1, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 8% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 50 (compared to 24 at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 13,569 (compared to 3,938 last season)

When to Seek Medical Help
People with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.
County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

44,"County, Solana Center Offering Discounted Rain Barrels","It’s been a dry winter, but there’s still going to be rain as we head toward spring. And you still have time to make sure you catch every drop, cut your water costs and protect our beaches by ordering a discounted $90, top-of-the-line rain barrel.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-solana-center-offering-discounted-rain-barrels-2/,2020-02-06T14:34:28-08:00,"
It’s been pretty dry so far this winter, but the national weather service says there’s still going to be rain as we head toward spring.
And you still have time to make sure you catch every drop, cut your water costs and protect our beaches by ordering a discounted $90, top-of-the-line rain barrel, thanks to the County’s Watershed Protection Program, the nonprofit Solana Center and Rain Water Solutions.
And your final cost could be as low as $25 with the help of a couple of rebates.
Just order an Ivy rain barrel online at the Solana Center’s website and choose to pick it up at the Solana Center’s offices in Encinitas or at one of two special events — Saturday, Feb. 22 in Spring Valley, or Saturday Feb. 29 in Ramona.
The rain barrels will not be shipped. Order your rain barrel by Feb. 16 to pick it up from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb 22, at Spring Valley’s Mount Miguel High School at 8585 Blossom Lane. Order by Feb. 22 to pick your barrel up from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 29 at the Ramona Community Center at 434 Aqua Lane.
If you can’t make either event, you can also pick up your barrel at the Solana Center’s Encinitas offices at 137 N. El Camino Real from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday’s through Thursdays, or from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays.
County residents can apply for a $35 rebate that can shrink their rain barrel’s cost from $90 to $55 if they get their water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — either through the San Diego County Water Authority or its participating member agencies in San Diego County.
In addition, the County of San Diego is giving out its own $30 discount to residents living in unincorporated areas on the first 200 rain barrels ordered, which can shrink your final cost to just $25.
Having a rain barrel can let you “harvest” rain right off your roof and use it to keep your gardens or lawns green the old-fashioned way. That can cut your water costs and even help protect our local beaches by preventing excess rain from washing pollution off our roofs and yards, and down our streets to the ocean.
The Ivy Rain Barrels have a locking, child-proof lid, are made of 100% recycled material, have overflow ports, protective screening to keep mosquitoes out, a ¾-inch ball valve to connect to your garden hose or to another barrel, and they don’t need pumps because they use gravity to dispense their collected rainwater.
Getting your discounted rain barrel is as easy as one, two, three.
One, order your barrel. Two, apply for your rebate(s). Three, go pick up your barrel.
Order and buy your barrel
Go to the County/Solana Center’s events website. Scroll halfway down the page and choose one of the three locations to pick up your rain barrel — at Spring Valley’s Mount Miguel High School, the Ramona Community Center, or the Solana Center in Encinitas. Once you choose a location, you can order and pay for your rain barrel with a credit card.
If you live in an unincorporated community or area and not in a city, remember to check the “unincorporated” box to make sure you are given the County’s $30 discount. The discount will be automatically applied to your purchase price when you’re buying your rain barrel. Solana Center officials will double-check after your purchase to make sure you’re eligible for the discount. You can check here to see a list of eligible, ineligible and potentially eligible ZIP codes.
You may buy as many rain barrels as you’d like, but the Metropolitan rebate and County discount are limited to two per household.
Finally, remember that your rain barrel will not be delivered. You can pick it up at any of the three pickup locations.
Apply for your rebate(s)
$35 rebates from the Metropolitan Water District are available within 90 days of ordering/buying your rain barrel, so as soon as you order your rain barrel go to Metropolitan’s SoCalWaterSmart rain barrel rebates webpage. Rebates are available on a first-come, first-served basis. You can check out the Metropolitan Water District rebates’ frequently asked questions and conditions for help.
Pick up your rain barrel!
When you buy your barrel(s), Rain Water Solutions will email you a confirmation of your purchase (look for the email with the subject line “Order#… confirmed”). Remember to bring your confirmation email with you when you go to your chosen location to pick up your barrel. And remember to leave room in your car! Solana Center officials say that barrels fit easily in any four-door sedan or SUV and even into some two-door cars.
For more information, go to the Solana Center’s Rain Water Solutions webpage.

45,Poll Workers Still Needed for March 3 Election,"Time is running short, and poll workers, especially those who are bilingual in any one of six specific languages, are still needed for the March 3 Presidential Primary Election.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/poll-workers-still-needed-for-march-3-election/,2020-02-07T11:21:24-08:00,"
Time is running short, and poll workers, especially those who are bilingual in any one of six specific languages, are still needed for the March 3 Presidential Primary Election. The Registrar’s office is required by federal law to provide bilingual speakers and voting materials to voters who speak Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese. A survey by the University of California, Berkeley showed a need for speakers of Arabic and Korean at about 90 precincts, so the Registrar’s office is also recruiting bilingual poll workers in those languages for the March 3 election.
In addition, the Registrar needs standby poll workers who can be assigned on short notice. Standbys who can also speak a second language are in demand, too. Poll workers receive a stipend ranging from $100 to $175 depending on the assignment, and those who are bilingual receive an additional $15 if they are assigned specifically to provide language assistance to voters. Poll workers must be registered voters in the state of California or must be permanent residents in the United States and have transportation to their assigned polling location. They will also need access to the internet to complete an online training and attend a 2- or 3-hour in-person class depending on their assignment.
Volunteers can be poll workers for any neighborhood that needs them. Bilingual poll workers fluent in English and one or more of the following languages are needed in the cities and neighborhoods below.
Arabic: Clairemont, El Cajon, Rancho Santa Fe 
Chinese: Carlsbad, Chula Vista, Clairemont, Downtown San Diego, Mira Mesa, Normal Heights, Poway, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Peñasquitos, Santee, Scripps/Pomerado, Serra Mesa, University City

46,County Helps to Re-open 28 Affordable Homes in Carlsbad,"Twenty-eight affordable homes officially re-opened today in Carlsbad, thanks to the County Health and Human Services Agency.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-helps-to-re-open-28-affordable-homes-in-carlsbad/,2020-02-07T16:22:36-08:00,"
Twenty-eight affordable homes officially re-opened today in Carlsbad, thanks to the County Health and Human Services Agency.
The County invested $675,000 in HOME funds in the rehabilitation of Vista Las Flores, an apartment community that serves low-income families who make 60% or less of the Area Median Income. The homes come in two- and three-bedroom configurations with three reserved for families with at least one family member who is experiencing a developmental disability.
“We are thrilled to be here with you all in the great city of Carlsbad celebrating the grand re-opening of Vista las Flores,” said HHSA Director Nick Macchione during the event. “Despite a record pace of openings and groundbreakings, the affordable housing crisis in San Diego and the entire state of California remains real.”
The property, which Wakeland Housing originally developed with San Diego Interfaith Housing Foundation in 2002, recently completed the rehabilitation project which revamped the entire property, including all 28 apartments and the community room.
Viva las Flores has new rooftop solar panels, which offset 100% of common area and 25% of residents’ energy use, a new playground and barbecue area, and two electric vehicle charging stations.
The County has taken a variety of recent actions to increase the number of affordable housing units in the region. They include:
Establishing the Innovative Housing Trust Fund to provide gap financing to developments that created and/or preserved affordable housing.
Operating the No Place Like Home Program that provides capital and operating subsidies for permanent supportive housing.
Identifying excess County land to use for affordable housing.
Investing United States Housing and Urban Development grant funds in programs that strengthen the success of affordable housing developments.
In addition, the County Health and Human Services Agency has established a Housing Strategy for the next five years that supports the County’s Live Well San Diego vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.

48,County Shelters Offer Pet Adoption Special,"Looking for companionship, somebuddy who loves you to go on long walks on the beach with or just cuddle with on the couch? Wouldn’t it be great if he or she jumped up and down when you got home? Forget Tinder. People aren’t always truthful on those sites.   ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-shelters-offer-pet-adoption-special/,2020-02-10T10:07:16-08:00,"
Looking for companionship, somebuddy who loves you to go on long walks on the beach with or just cuddle with on the couch? Wouldn’t it be great if he or she jumped up and down when you got home? Forget Tinder. People aren’t always truthful on those sites.   
But animals are loyal, faithful friends who always lend an ear whether you have great news to share or  are feeling blue. A dog or cat could be the best Valentine’s Day present to yourself ever.  
The County Department of Animal Services will be holding a Valentine’s dog and cat adoption special from Feb. 11 through Feb. 16 to help you find your new love monster. Any dog or cat, over the age of six months, can be yours for $14. 
“Chocolates are quickly eaten and roses will eventually wilt, but an adopted animal’s love for their new family will last a lifetime,” County Animal Services Director Dan DeSousa said.  
If you’d like to see all the animals, stop by the shelter or visit the adoptions page. If you absolutely fall in love with one, don’t delay because adoptions are on a first-come, first-served basis. Be aware that each adoption could take up to two hours.  To speed up the process, go online, download the adoption application and fill it out at home. Renters should also bring a copy of their lease to show it’s OK to have a pet at their home. 
When you find a pet you want to adopt, bring their ID number shown on the front of the kennel to the Greeter Desk.  
If you currently have another dog, you may consider bringing him or her with you to see how he or she interacts with a new dog. Families are also welcome and may get to spend time with the dog or cat to see if the adoption will be a good fit. 
Currently, more than 51 are available at the County’s two animal care facilities located in Bonita and Carlsbad. All the adopted animals will be spayed or neutered, and microchipped before they go home. Vaccinations will also be up to date on dogs and cats. 
Shelter hours are 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., but adoptions close at 4 p.m. Normal adoption fees are: kittens under the age of 6 months, $75; cats, $65; puppies under the age of 6 months, $100; dogs, $75.

When was the last time you had your blood pressure checked? If it’s been a while, this month might be a good time to turn your attention to this matter of the heart.
On Valentine’s Day, residents can get their blood pressure checked for free at any of about 450 locations across San Diego County, the U.S. and Mexico for Love Your Heart Day.  Many faith-based organizations are getting in on the action by hosting blood pressure checks Feb. 11-16.
As an incentive to get people to take charge of their health, the San Diego Gulls will be offering a 27% discount on tickets to people who get their blood pressure checked. The Gulls are a partner of Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
Residents can call 2-1-1 or go to loveyourheartsd.org for the nearest screening location. Locations include fire stations, libraries, community centers, health clinics, houses of worship, businesses and County facilities, among others. Hours for each screening site vary.
Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, and the second-leading cause of death in San Diego County. Obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes and a family history of heart disease can put someone at greater risk of heart disease.
Last year, more than 43,000 people got their blood pressure checked at Love Your Heart sites in the United States and Mexico.
Below: San Diegans from a variety of backgrounds explain how high blood pressure has affected themselves or loved ones.

The County Board of Supervisors received an in-depth look today at how the Strong Families, Thriving Communities initiative has improved the lives of minority families interacting with the County’s child welfare and juvenile justice systems.
Strong Families, Thriving Communities was created in 2017 in partnership with The San Diego Foundation and the Clinton Foundation. The collaboration was a response to national and local data that shows children of color, when compared to their white peers, have a disproportionate involvement in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.
Since the program started, the County has worked with more than 100 community partners to examine challenges and identify solutions to make child welfare and juvenile justice systems more equitable for families and children.
Together with its partners, Strong Families, Thriving Communities created a Blueprint for Action. The initiative outlined 29 specific goals, including suggested system changes and timelines for completing them. Significant accomplishments of the three-year coalition include:

Development of the Trauma-Informed Care Code of Conduct by youth to ensure that all child and family-serving systems and community supports have policies and practices that demonstrate trauma-informed principles.
Creation of the San Diego Mentorship Network which supports the work of community mentors and evaluates the impact of mentoring.
Partnership with the Health and Human Services Agency Behavioral Health Services in the creation of behavioral health hubs that increase access to clinical care in communities.

County departments have focused their efforts to ensure that all staff receive trainings in trauma-informed care and an awareness of how biases impact decisions, relationships, and healthy outcomes for children and families in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems.

53,County Stands to Get Nearly $10 Million to Address Homelessness,The County of San Diego Board of Supervisors today voted to let the Health and Human Services Agency to apply for and receive nearly $10 million from state funds to address homelessness in the region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-stands-to-get-nearly-10-million-to-address-homelessness/,2020-02-11T12:11:33-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Board of Supervisors today voted to let the Health and Human Services Agency to apply for and receive nearly $10 million from state funds to address homelessness in the region.
The funding will come from the California Homeless Housing, Assistance and Prevention program grant. The County’s portion combined with funds going to other local agencies could bring the San Diego region a total $43.3 million to house people experiencing homelessness and who have complex health needs.
“We’ve taken several steps over the last few years to address some of the root causes of homelessness, including increased funding for programs,” said Chairman Greg Cox.
The County has demonstrated its commitment to using an integrated approach to improve the health and housing options of people experiencing homelessness and who have severe physical or behavioral health issues.
The County has been addressing the needs of people who are chronically homeless, through Project One for All, Whole Person Wellness and the Innovative Housing Trust Fund, among other actions.
HHAP funding may be used for a wide variety of activities including, but not limited to, rental assistance, workforce and other supports to retain housing and other innovative housing solutions and services.
The County Health and Human Services Agency will use these funds for Board-identified priorities to support homelessness prevention and intervention activities for vulnerable populations, such as foster youth and seniors.
If awarded and approved, HHSA will get about $2 million during Fiscal Year 2019-20 and another $2 million in Fiscal Year 2020-21. HHSA anticipates receiving $9,996,652 in total program funds through Fiscal Year 2024-25.
Today’s vote also allows HHSA to apply for future funding opportunities related to addressing homelessness throughout the region. Securing homeless funds aligns with the County’s Live Well San Diego vision to improve the health and wellbeing of area residents by addressing the housing and service needs of people experiencing homelessness throughout the county.

55,"San Diego Flu Deaths Increase to 57, Cases Drop Again","The number of influenza deaths in San Diego County increased to 57 after seven more fatalities were reported last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-flu-deaths-increase-to-57-cases-drop-again/,2020-02-12T10:52:51-08:00,"
The number of influenza deaths in San Diego County increased to 57 after seven more fatalities were reported last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The ages of the new flu deaths ranged from 60 to 89 years of age and all had underlying medical conditions.
A total of 1,548 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported last week, compared to 1,689 cases the prior week. The continued decrease in flu cases is an indication that flu activity in the region is easing.
“While influenza cases have continued to decline, flu activity is still widespread in the region,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should continue getting vaccinated and taking other preventive measures to avoid getting sick.”
The number of people showing up at local emergency departments with influenza-like symptoms has remained steady at 8% for several weeks.
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Feb. 8, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared to 8% the previous week).
Total influenza deaths to date: 57 (compared to 30 at this time last season).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 15,097 (compared to 4,414 last season).

When to Seek Medical Help
People with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.
County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

Since the County of San Diego adopted its General Plan nine years ago, 5,802 residences have been built in the county’s unincorporated communities, leaving capacity for another potential 60,748 residences under the plan.
And now you can track progress on the General Plan and local development online, thanks to a new County website — the Housing Capacity & Production Portal.
The portal includes text summary reports; maps that show how many residences have been built in each unincorporated community; the capacity the General Plan would still allow to be built in each community; and a search tool. It will be updated every quarter.
The County’s department of Planning & Development Services (PDS) created the new portal to give the public the ability to track the progress of the County’s General Plan on a regular basis.  PDS has been working on this system as required through the General Plan Implementation Plan and to facilitate the production of data needed for the annual report to the State on the General Plan’s Housing Element.
The current numbers in the portal are good as of Jan. 31, 2020, with information on 33 unincorporated communities in the county.
The portal, which also links to the County’s General Plan webpage, includes a total of 12 “heatmaps” depicting number ranges in colors, illustrating information including:

Number of residential dwelling units that are allowed by the County’s General Plan and could be built in the future if the land is suitable for construction, provided with infrastructure, and obtains necessary approvals from the County
Changes to the General Plan since 2011 that either increase or decrease the number of residential dwelling units that could be built
Number of existing and new residential dwelling units that were built since 2011
The number of residential dwelling units that have received discretionary approvals from the county since 2011 but haven’t been built
Residential Development Projects that are approved with units that either exceed or are below the amount allowed by the General Plan
Sites of residential dwelling units that are currently being graded and prepared for construction

Love was certainly in the air as dozens of couples said “I Do” during wedding ceremonies Friday at the County Administration Center.
Valentine’s Day is typically one of the busiest days of the year for the Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk’s office and this one had the added bonus of leading into a three-day weekend. Unlike the rain last year, the weather was also wedding picture perfect.
The office issued nearly 24,000 marriage licenses last year. Annually, nearly half of all weddings in the county are performed at a County office.
The Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk offers five locations for wedding ceremonies. They’re located at their offices in San Marcos, Kearny Mesa, Chula Vista, Santee and the County Administration Center downtown.
The Santee location offers a brand new, expanded wedding site and the County Administration Center boasts a newly remodeled wedding guest lounge and two marriage rooms with views overlooking San Diego Bay. Couples can also tie the knot outdoors at the Waterfront Park surrounding the historic County Administration Center.
Ceremonies can be performed in either English or Spanish. Couples can make an appointment for a marriage license or wedding ceremony through an online wedding reservation system.
While appointments are generally required to be married, walk-ins are welcomed only on Valentine’s Day at the downtown location until 5 p.m. Staff will stay and perform ceremonies for anyone still in line after that time.
For more information about the County’s marriage services, visit the Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk’s website.

If you missed the voter registration deadline Tuesday, you can still register to vote and cast a provisional ballot in the March 3 Presidential Primary Election. For now, that’s only at the Registrar of Voters Office. Then on Feb. 29, the Registrar will open four satellite locations so voters will have more opportunities to register and vote. Voters will be taking advantage of the Conditional Voter Registration law which allows voters a chance to register and cast a ballot after the registration deadline. Voters will need to fill out additional paperwork before voting so they should allow for extra time.
You can still register and vote by visiting:

The Registrar of Voters office at 5600 Overland Ave., San Diego, CA 92123 during the hours of 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday and until the polls close on Election Day. The office will also be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday, Feb. 29 and Sunday, March 1 for weekend voting.
Any of the Registrar’s four satellite voting locations from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 29 through Monday, March 2 until Election Day when the voting hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reflect the hours at the polls. The locations will be spread across the county.  The sites will be announced Feb. 25.

You may take advantage of this new law at your polling place. However, the Registrar urges you to visit the Registrar’s office now or one of its satellite locations during the three days prior to Election Day. These locations are better equipped to serve prospective voters and will have all ballot types in the election. Putting this off until Election Day will likely cause great delays and long lines.
Prospective voters will be able to register to vote, mark and cast their ballot provisionally. That means the ballots will be counted after election officials verify the voter registration and confirm the voter has not yet voted elsewhere in the current election. Provisional ballots are typically verified and counted after Election Day.
During the last election, conditional voting was allowed only at the Registrar’s office. On Election Day, voters waited in long lines for hours to register and cast their ballots.
“A presidential election comes with a big voter turnout and the potential for longer lines,” said Registrar Michael Vu. “Not registered? No problem. But don’t wait until Election Day when you can avoid the lines today.”
For voters who need language assistance, election materials are also available in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese.

County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

62,County Board Ratifies COVID-19 Emergency Declaration,"The Board of Supervisors today voted to ratify the County’s declaration of a local health emergency and proclamation a local emergency to deal with the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-board-ratifies-covid-19-emergency-declaration/,2020-02-19T17:03:01-08:00,"
The Board of Supervisors today voted to ratify the County’s declaration of a local health emergency and proclamation a local emergency to deal with the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.
The move is meant to reassure the public that local health authorities are proactively working to stay ahead of any challenges that may arise. The local health emergency will last for 30 days, the local emergency for 60 days. The Board will consider whether each action should be extended at its respective time interval.
“We have heard myriad concerns from people and organizations throughout the County of San Diego,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “I want to assure you that the risk to the general public, related to COVID-19, is low at this time.”
Additionally, these actions empower the County Health and Human Services Agency to:

more effectively respond to COVID-19
seek and utilize mutual aid
potentially obtain reimbursement
ensure that the County’s health professionals and other local stakeholders have all the necessary tools at their disposal, such as N-95 respirators

With the federally mandated quarantine for the evacuees currently at Marines Corps Air Station Miramar coming to an end, the County’s focus is now on monitoring travelers arriving in the U.S. from provinces in China other than Hubei.
Currently, HHSA has seven patients under investigation. Six have tested negative for the virus and one specimen is awaiting test results. None of the patients needed to be hospitalized. New statistics will be released on Fridays.
These medium-risk people will be on home quarantine, self-monitored under the careful supervision of HHSA.

63,Poll Workers Still Needed for March 3 Election,"The Presidential Primary Election is Tuesday, March 3 and the Registrar of Voters still needs poll workers throughout the county.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/poll-workers-still-needed-for-march-3-election-2/,2020-02-20T11:00:15-08:00,"
The Presidential Primary Election is Tuesday, March 3 and the Registrar of Voters still needs poll workers throughout the county.
In particular, there is a need for additional poll workers in Alpine, Clairemont, Del Mar Heights, Descanso, El Cajon, Julian, La Jolla, La Mesa, Linda Vista, Mira Mesa, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Peñasquitos, Santee, Tierrasanta, UCSD and University City.
Bilingual poll workers fluent in English and one or more of the following languages are needed in these cities and neighborhoods:
Arabic: El Cajon
Korean: Carmel Valley, Del Mar Heights, UCSD, University City
Chinese: Carlsbad, Centre City, City Heights, Clairemont, Chula Vista, Escondido, Hillcrest, Linda Vista, Mira Mesa, Oceanside, Otay, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Peñasquitos, Scripps/Pomerado, Serra Mesa, University City, Vista
Filipino: Bonita, Chula Vista, Encanto, Encinitas, Escondido, Mira Mesa, National City, Nestor, Oceanside, Otay, Poway, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Peñasquitos Scripps, San Ysidro, Spring Valley, Solana Beach
Spanish: Chollas, Centre City, City Heights, Clairemont, El Cajon, Encanto, Encinitas, Escondido, Fallbrook, La Mesa, Lakeside, Lemon Grove, Linda Vista, Mira Mesa, Poway, Ramona, Santee, San Marcos, Southeastern San Diego, Solana Beach, Spring Valley, Rancho Peñasquitos
Vietnamese: Bonita, Carlsbad, Chollas Park, Chula Vista, El Cajon, Encanto, Encinitas, Escondido,  La Mesa, Lakeside, Lemon Grove, Linda Vista, Mira Mesa, North Park, Oceanside, Rancho Bernardo, Rancho Peñasquitos, San Marcos, Scripps Pomerado, Serra Mesa, Solana Beach, Southeastern San Diego, University City, Vista
Poll workers receive a stipend ranging from $100 to $175 depending on the assignment. Those who are bilingual receive an additional $15 if they are assigned specifically to provide language assistance to voters. Poll workers must be registered voters in California or must be permanent residents in the United States and have transportation to their assigned polling location. They will also need access to the internet to complete an online training and attend a two-hour class.
The Registrar’s office is required by federal law to provide bilingual speakers and voting materials to voters who speak Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese. A survey by the University of California, Berkeley showed a need for speakers of Arabic and Korean at about 90 precincts, so the Registrar’s office is also recruiting poll workers bilingual in those languages for the March 3 election. If you are bilingual in any one of the six specific languages, the Registrar asks for your help in the election.
Prospective poll workers can apply online at sdvote.com. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.

65,Three Wild Mice Test Positive for Hantavirus,"Three wild mice collected in routine monitoring in Carlsbad have tested positive for hantavirus, prompting County officials to remind people they should never sweep or vacuum up after rodents if they find them in living spaces.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/three-wild-mice-test-positive-for-hantavirus/,2020-02-21T09:09:48-08:00,"
Three wild mice collected in routine monitoring in Carlsbad have tested positive for hantavirus, prompting County officials to remind people they should never sweep or vacuum up after rodents if they find them in living spaces.
County officials said it was important for people to remember to use “wet-cleaning” methods instead of sweeping or vacuuming if they find evidence of rodents in homes, sheds, garages, cabins or other living spaces.
Hantavirus is potentially deadly, and people are exposed to it when the virus, shed by wild rodents in urine, feces and saliva, dries and stirred into the air and inhaled.
While hantavirus is common in San Diego County, people are unlikely to be exposed to the virus because the carriers, wild rodents, wild mice in particular, generally want to live and nest away from people.
Still, County officials said people should be careful to use wet cleaning methods, with bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags if they find rodent droppings or other signs that wild rodents have gotten into living spaces and they must clean.
The mice collected from an open space in Carlsbad included two harvest mice and one deer mouse.
There is no cure or vaccine for hantavirus. In 2019, 42 rodents collected in routine monitoring by County Vector Control tested positive for hantavirus.
Last month, two cactus mice collected in Santee and Valley Center tested positive for hantavirus. Twelve rodents have tested positive so far in 2020.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

66,How San Diego County Monitors Potential COVID-19 Cases,Here’s the process HHSA follows for patients who arrive at one of the 11 U.S. airports where CDC is conducting screening as people return from areas of mainland China other than Hubei province.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/how-san-diego-county-monitors-potential-covid-19-cases/,2020-02-21T12:12:29-08:00,"
The local medical community has been working with County health officials on monitoring potential cases of the new coronavirus or COVID-19 in people who have traveled to China or been in close contact with a confirmed case.
The County Health and Human Services Agency follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for risk assessment and management of people with potential COVID-19 or patients under investigation (PUI).
Due to patient privacy, HHSA will not release information on patients under investigation for COVID-19 or people under self-quarantine.
HHSA is releasing the number of patients under investigation, as well as those who are under self-quarantine. Figures are updated Fridays.
Patients Under Investigation
Here’s the process HHSA follows for patients who arrive at one of the 11 U.S. airports where the CDC is conducting screening as people return from areas of mainland China other than Hubei province:
If patients have no symptoms, they are self-quarantined at home for self-monitoring with public health supervision. Self-quarantine lasts 14 days.
If patients develop symptoms — fever, cough or difficulty breathing —they should call the County health department; if they are determined to meet the CDC guidelines to be considered a PUI, then transport to local hospital is arranged, the PUI is placed in isolation and specimens are collected and sent to the CDC for confirmation of COVID-19.
The patient’s symptoms determine where the PUI is in isolation until test results are returned.
Severe Symptoms

If patients have severe illness (e.g., difficulty breathing, high fever) they remain hospitalized and in isolation.
If patients are in isolation at a local hospital, the hospital treats and monitors the PUI and any hospital personnel with direct patient contact to the PUI.

Mild Symptoms

If symptoms are mild, the PUI is released to mandatory isolation at home, under public health supervision until results return.
If patients are negative, the patients will continue home quarantine and self-monitoring with public health supervision until the 14-days quarantine period is over.

If a PUI is under self-quarantine at home, the following takes place:

Patients are under self-observation and remain alert for possible symptoms.
Patients are asked to take their temperature twice daily and write it on their log. HHSA contacts them daily —by phone or text or both— to find out if they have developed symptoms. Contact will last for 14 days.
Patients are asked to remain at home to the extent possible.
Patients are asked to avoid public or group activities, such as going to the movies, parties, etc.
Patients are asked to use good hand hygiene and to wash their hands thoroughly with water and soap.

Note this is for March 2020 Primary Election. When drop-off locations are available for Nov. 3 election, they will be posted on sdvote.com. 
Has your mail ballot been sitting on the coffee table for weeks and you are just now getting around to marking it? You have options when it comes to turning in your mail ballot for the March 3 Presidential Primary Election.
You can drop it in the mail, but if you wait past tomorrow, you may want to drop it off at any one of 61 sites throughout the county before Election Day. These drop-off sites will be open during each location’s regular business hours from Monday, Feb. 24 through Election Day.
The quicker ballots are returned to the Registrar’s Office, the quicker they can be prepared for counting on Election Night, saving time and taxpayer dollars.
“More than 1.3 million San Diego County voters have chosen the convenience of mail ballots and that number continues to rise,” said Registrar Michael Vu. “The early drop-off sites provide a great service for voters. They help with the timely return of mail ballots and decrease the high volume of voters dropping off mail ballots at polling places on Election Day.”
The drop-off sites are located at 61 libraries across the county. The sites are not early voting locations, but for mail ballots only. Each mail ballot packet contains an insert with additional information about the drop-off locations.
Registrar of Voters employees will accept the mail ballots at the drop-off locations and follow specific protocols to maintain security.
Voters can also drop off their mail ballot or vote in person at the Registrar of Voters located at 5600 Overland Ave., San Diego, 92123. The office will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday until Election Day when the voting hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reflect the hours at the polls, or between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 29 and Sunday, March 1.

68,County Selects Contractor for Southeastern Live Well Center,"The County of San Diego has selected PCL Construction and Steinberg Hart/RJC Architects to begin negotiations and contract finalization for the design and construction of the new Southeastern Live Well Center. The 80,000-square-foot facility will be built at the intersection of Market Street and Euclid Avenue.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-selects-contractor-for-southeastern-live-well-center/,2020-02-25T12:21:33-08:00,"
The County of San Diego has selected PCL Construction and Steinberg Hart/RJC Architects to begin negotiations and contract finalization for the design and construction of the new Southeastern Live Well Center. The 80,000-square-foot facility will be built at the intersection of Market Street and Euclid Avenue. The approximately $76 million project will be the County’s sixth regional community service hub providing a variety of health and community services to residents.
“We began this project with the desire to provide first-class facilities to vulnerable populations who need and deserve adequate resources to live safely and thrive,” said Board of Supervisors Chairman Greg Cox. “The community spoke clearly about the need for better outreach and engagement to all who would be impacted. I am proud to say that we incorporated this feedback to create a project that benefits all residents and we look forward to engaging the community in the final design presentations.”
Competitive design proposals from three design-build entities were evaluated over a two-month period by a Source Selection Committee (SSC) that was formed in fall 2019. The committee included County experts and community members. The SSC also conducted several meetings with a larger group of community members in the form of a Community Technical Advisory Committee that reviewed the proposals in detail and provided significant feedback, which helped inform the SSC’s selection.
The three proposals and designs contained several features that came as a result of the discussions with the community. During last October and November, the three conceptual designs were shared with the community at over 30 community locations, events and meetings. As a result, more than 1,200 comments by residents were received. Those comments were compiled into a report that was reviewed by the SSC.
“This is another important milestone for this project,” said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher. “Last year we opened up the process, made it more transparent, gathered vital community input and now the committee has selected a contractor it believes can build the Southeastern Live Well Center to reflect the vision put forward by the residents. We will continue to keep the community informed throughout the build process.”
The County and PCL will begin negotiations and upon contract signature, will schedule presentations in the community as the design is finalized and work begins. The contract will require significant local subcontracting, local workforce outreach and a hiring commitment by the contractor.
Information about the design and the presentation schedule will be available on the Live Well San Diego website.
The Southeastern Live Well Center is expected to break ground in early 2021 and open in late 2022. The center will serve as a hub for community meetings, educational opportunities and workforce training in addition to the County services that will be available.
Services that will be available include medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities and services for veterans and members of the military. The Live Well Center will also include a 4,000-square-foot conference center that can be used for community meetings.
Live Well Centers are already operating in National City, Chula Vista, Escondido and Lemon Grove. A new Live Well Center is  currently under construction in Oceanside.

69,Dozens Housed Under Expanded Program Targeting Homelessness,Fifty-six additional unsheltered people in the unincorporated areas of the region now have a roof over their head and a bed to sleep in thanks to the expansion of the County Health and Human Services Agency’s Hotel/Motel Voucher Program.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/dozens-housed-under-expanded-program-targeting-homelessness/,2020-02-25T12:58:48-08:00,"
Fifty-six additional unsheltered people in the unincorporated areas of the region now have a roof over their head and a bed to sleep in thanks to the expansion of the County Health and Human Services Agency’s Hotel/Motel Voucher Program.
The 56 are the first wave of an additional 125 people to be supported through the program’s expansion last month. Besides providing vouchers, the program offers access to transportation, case management and helps individuals to find a stable place to live.
“The County’s commitment to a comprehensive approach to the full spectrum of housing needs is essential and we are already seeing progress ,” HHSA Integrative Services Director Omar Passons told the Board today during an update on the measures adopted to help deal with homelessness in unincorporated communities.
The estimated cost of the expansion of the Hotel/Motel Voucher program is about $2.3 million in fiscal year 2019-20, depending on how many people use the program. The yearly costs are estimated to be $5.6 million. However, the need for this service is not expected to be ongoing once other recommendations are implemented. It is anticipated that a more robust care coordination effort will replace this one in the upcoming fiscal year.
The measures, brought forward by Supervisors Dianne Jacob and Jim Desmond, are helping to address homelessness in unincorporated areas that have seen a significant increase of people who don’t have a place to live.
Passons also said the Sheriff’s Department Homeless Assistance Resource Team (HART) is in the process of being expanded to include eight dedicated deputies to help identify people experiencing homelessness, work with HHSA social service professionals, assess their needs and help them find a path to permanent housing. HART will now be providing services to all unincorporated communities simultaneously.

“Outreach teams can now stay in the field longer and respond to areas which may require immediate response, while still maintaining scheduled outreach details to ensure continuum of care to those in need,” Passons said.
The unincorporated communities of San Diego County have experienced a significant increase in homelessness and its associated impacts in recent years.  The County has a current estimate based on available data that 200 emergency, 150 interim and 200 permanent homes are needed in the unincorporated portions of East County.
A 2019 ruling out of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit determined that municipal ordinances prohibiting sleeping or camping on public property could not be enforced by law enforcement without the provision of access to an alternative shelter location.
County staff from multiple departments recently screened more than 860 properties in Fallbrook, Lakeside and Spring Valley to lease, license or purchase for safe and temporary emergency relocation options or a shelter, and where health services may be provided. Emergency housing typically lasts less than 30 days and is the first step to interim housing, which could last up to two years and could lead to a person having a permanent place to live.
Staff also searched for properties for temporary storage, which could provide people the ability to safeguard important documents and safely store their personal belongings.
Fifteen properties have been identified; six are in Spring Valley, two in Lakeside and seven in Fallbrook.
“We will further evaluate the sites to determine suitability and to define the effort, cost and timing to provide for the range of solutions,” said Marko Medved, Director of County General Services, adding the Board will get another update in 60 days. “County staff will also explore alternative structure types for housing or storage.”
County staff is also exploring the feasibility of expanding the Homeless Court program to include warrant removals for people who are homeless in exchange for participation in a transitional living program.
The enhanced measures are the result of the Board of Supervisors’ request that the County review and propose regulations to strengthen the way they address sleeping in public and commercial areas, environmentally sensitive lands with endangered habitats, areas near watersheds and areas that present extreme fire danger.
They are also the result of a recently piloted intensive outreach effort through HHSA, HART, County departments of Public Works and Parks and Recreation to connect people who are homeless in these communities with services and potential housing. Many have serious, chronic needs and County strategies aim to break the cycle of homelessness, addiction, medical emergencies and incarceration.
The County has multiple programs in place to connect people experiencing homelessness to services they need and to help them find a home. Over the past few years, the County has made significant investments in outreach, treatment, and housing services. The County has greatly expanded critical services since the beginning of the Affordable Care Act. During fiscal year 2019-20, the County will be spending $712.9 million on mental health and substance use treatment programs and services.

70,Satellite Voting Locations to Open Saturday,The Registrar of Voters will open four satellite voting locations this weekend to add to options for early voting and to help those who haven’t registered to vote but still want to take part in the March 3 Presidential Primary Election.  ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/satellite-voting-locations-to-open-saturday/,2020-02-25T13:30:24-08:00,"
The Registrar of Voters will open four satellite voting locations this weekend to add to options for early voting and to help those who haven’t registered to vote but still want to take part in the March 3 Presidential Primary Election.
During the last election, voters could conditionally register and vote on Election Day but only at the Registrar’s office. Long lines wrapped around the building and those registering endured hours-long waits.
This election, voters can register and vote at the Registrar’s office and every polling place. That may result in long waits at polling places.
To offset an expected rush of late registrants this year, Registrar of Voters Michael Vu announced the availability of four satellite voting locations Tuesday.
“The satellite voting locations will give voters the opportunity to register and vote before Election Day,” said Vu. “The earlier you register and vote, the less likely you will run into long delays. Waiting until Election Day almost guarantees you’ll run into long lines.”
The satellite locations will act as an arm of the Registrar’s office and Registrar personnel will have access to the status of all registered voters in the county. Staff can help with the registration process and give voters the ballot specific to their residence address.
The ballots will be provisional, meaning voters will need a little extra time to fill out information on the provisional envelope and seal their ballot inside after voting. The Registrar’s office can’t count it until it checks to see if you’re eligible to vote and you have not voted elsewhere in the state.
Voters who visit the satellite locations will also have access to new ballot marking devices. The devices allow voters to mark their choices using a touch screen and print out their selections on a paper ballot. The touch screen is used only to generate the paper ballot, not record the vote electronically. The voter can review the paper ballot before putting it into an envelope, and then the ballot box.
The Registrar’s office is now open to serve voters each day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Then satellite voting locations and the Registrar’s office will be open Saturday, Feb. 29 through Monday, March 2 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. All will again be open on Election Day when the voting hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reflect the hours at the polls.

71,Board Receives Update on Initiative to Improve Child Abuse Hotline,The County Board of Supervisors received an update Tuesday about efforts to improve the system used to take and process calls reporting child abuse.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-receives-update-on-initiative-to-improve-child-abuse-hotline/,2020-02-26T12:26:27-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors received an update Tuesday about efforts to improve the system used to take and process calls reporting child abuse.
Under the existing system, all calls concerning potential cases of abused and neglected minors are routed to the Child Abuse and Neglect Hotline. That hotline is staffed by social workers who determine if a report warrants an investigation by CWS.
Annual historical data shows that about half of the nearly 44,000 calls received by the hotline do not meet the threshold to be assigned for an investigation. However, half of the families that are not investigated after the initial report have a subsequent report to the hotline within two years.
In response to these numbers, CWS created a Family Strengthening and Prevention Initiative, under which it developed Review, Assess, Direct (RAD) teams, a multidisciplinary team process for its hotline. RAD teams conduct a secondary review of lower-risk referrals to ensure the social worker who reviewed the initial report made the appropriate decision. In addition to hotline social workers, RAD teams are staffed by regional emergency response social workers and community partners.
CWS also partnered with the phone resource and referral hub 2-1-1 San Diego on a pilot program in the area’s North Central Region last month to provide additional support. If the RAD team does not find grounds for a CWS investigation, they refer families to the 2-1-1 San Diego Connect program.
The 2-1-1 San Diego Connect program provides community-based services that can assist with preventing child maltreatment. When a family contacts 2-1-1 San Diego Connect, they complete a comprehensive screening, which evaluates factors like their housing situation, access to food and health services, and social connections.
Once the family’s needs have been identified, the program connects them to community services based on their individual situation. These services include income and housing assistance, childcare and food resources.
The Family Strengthening and Prevention pilot program kicked off in January and will operate for six months. CWS will monitor the outcomes of the initiative and provide updates to the Child and Family Strengthening Advisory Board along the way.
CWS plans to eventually expand the initiative to all regions of the County to reduce child maltreatment, lower the number of child welfare investigations and reduce the likelihood of subsequent referrals. The program aligns with the County’s Live Well San Diego vision to improve the health and well-being of all San Diegans, especially vulnerable area residents.

72,Mumps Outbreak Reported in San Diego State University Students,"Six San Diego State University students were diagnosed with confirmed or probable mumps in the last week, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) reported today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/mumps-outbreak-reported-in-san-diego-state-university-students/,2020-02-26T15:47:41-08:00,"
Six San Diego State University students were diagnosed with confirmed or probable mumps in the last week, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) reported today. The six students live off campus at BLVD63, a large apartment community that is not affiliated with the university and is located at 6345 El Cajon Blvd. in San Diego.
“These six mumps cases represent a small outbreak of this highly contagious viral disease,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The best way to prevent mumps is by getting the measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR vaccine.”
HHSA will be conducting free vaccination clinics at BLVD63 from 3 to 6 p.m. on Feb. 27 and 28. The clinics will be held for BLVD63 residents and SDSU students who wish to be immunized and vaccines will be given on a first come, first served basis.
Two doses of the vaccine are routinely recommended – one at 12 to 15 months of age and another at 4 to 6 years of age. It is recommended that all SDSU students complete the two-dose series if they have not already done so, and a third dose is being recommended to anyone who lives or works at BLVD63.
“Student Health Services (SHS) was able to quickly respond to this public health concern and worked to isolate these students, as well as provide initial information to our campus community,” said Libby Skiles, SDSU SHS Director. “In collaboration with the county, our team is supporting the impacted students and working to proactively protect the overall health and wellbeing of our community.”
The cases at BLVD63 come on the heels of an uptick in local cases in recent months. In addition to the cases at BLVD63, there have been four other cases in the county so far this year. In 2019, San Diego County recorded 66 mumps cases, compared to nine cases in 2018 and 15 the year before that. Last year’s increase marks a 25-year high in mumps cases in the county.
In addition to the local cases, a substantial number of infectious parotitis/mumps cases have recently been reported in Baja California, Mexico. In 2019, 900 cases were reported there, the largest number since 2001. In the first six weeks of 2020, a total of 138 cases have been reported in Baja California. It is not known at this time whether the SDSU cases have any connection to the cases in Mexico.
Mumps is spread by coughing, sneezing or close contact with an infected person. Mumps can cause fever, headache, earache, and inflammation of the salivary glands which results in swelling and tenderness of the jaw. Anyone who thinks they have mumps should contact their provider before seeking medical care so proper precautions can be taken to prevent exposure to others.
Severe complications are rare, but can include meningitis, decreased fertility, permanent hearing loss, and, in extreme cases, fetal loss during first trimester of pregnancy. There is no treatment for mumps. Most people recover without problems.
For more information about mumps, other vaccine-preventable diseases, and the vaccines that protect against them, please contact the County HHSA Immunization Program at (866) 358-2966 or visit the website at www.sdiz.org.

74,"Flu Deaths Increase to 74, Cases Decrease in San Diego","The number of local influenza deaths increased to 74 after 11 additional fatalities were reported last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-deaths-increase-to-74-cases-decrease-in-san-diego/,2020-02-27T08:37:44-08:00,"
The number of local influenza deaths increased to 74 after 11 additional fatalities were reported last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The new flu deaths include a 26-year-old woman from South County who died Feb. 13 from influenza B. Only two of the 11 reported deaths occurred last week, and all had underlying medical conditions.
“Influenza can be deadly, especially for those with existing chronic health conditions,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Getting a flu shot is the best way to prevent from getting sick.”
The number of lab-confirmed cases decreased last week, when 1,232 cases were reported. That’s 402 fewer flu cases compared to the previous week. To date, a total of 17,935 cases have been reported.
Also, fewer people showed up at local emergency departments with influenza-like illness last week; 6% of all visits. The figure was 7% the week before.
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Feb. 22, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 6% of all visits (compared to 7% the previous week).
Total influenza deaths to date: 74 (compared to 41 at this time last season).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 17,935 (compared to 5,486 last season).

When to Seek Medical Help
People with influenza-like symptoms continue to crowd local emergency departments and are taxing some hospitals.
County health officials are encouraging people who are sick to first contact their health care provider by telephone or arrange an urgent appointment.  You should go to an emergency department when you have any of the following symptoms:

Difficulty breathing or shortness of breath
Chest pain or abdominal pain
Sudden dizziness
Confusion
Severe or persistent vomiting
Flu-like symptoms that appear to get better, but then return with a fever and worse cough

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

76,County Public Health Lab Now Able to Test for New Coronavirus,"The County Public Health Laboratory is now able to test for the novel coronavirus, the cause of the respiratory disease COVID-19, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-public-health-lab-now-able-to-test-for-new-coronavirus/,2020-02-27T16:58:43-08:00,"
The County Public Health Laboratory is now able to test for the novel coronavirus, the cause of the respiratory disease COVID-19, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Having that capability means that HHSA will no longer have to send all specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, substantially reducing the time it takes for results.
“This is great news for San Diego County and will help with our ongoing efforts to contain COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Being able to test locally means that when we have patients under investigation, we can more rapidly remove unneeded restrictions from those without infection.  Should someone test positive, we will continue to keep them isolated.”
The County Public Health Lab now has the capability to do up to 40 tests in one run. The lab is one of dozens across the nation certified by the CDC to test for the new coronavirus.
“The number of specimens we’ve been getting for testing is currently low, but we expect the need to increase,” said Brett Austin, director of HHSA’s Public Health Lab. “We are ready to increase capacity as required.”
Prior to getting the testing kit, the County Public Health Lab had to send specimens to CDC and results took several days to return. Now, those tested for potential cases of COVID-19 will know their results in 24 to 48 hours. Positive tests will still need to be confirmed by the CDC.
County Microbiologist Jovan Shepherd prepares a specimen for testing for new coronavirus.
CDC currently recommends testing patients with symptoms — fever, cough or difficulty breathing — after returning from China or other areas with community transmission of coronavirus disease or who have had known contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case.
The risk of COVID-19 is still very low, especially if you have not travelled to an area where the virus has been detected or had close contact with a patient who tested positive for this new coronavirus.
“We want to assure the public that we are prepared and are conducting surveillance just like we do for any communicable disease,” Wooten said.
How to Protect Yourself from Coronaviruses
It’s important for the public to be prepared should a local COVID-19 outbreak occur. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

If you want to vote in the March 3 Presidential Primary Election, you can beat the rush at the polls by taking advantage of weekend voting hours at five early voting locations.
“We know people are busy, and voting on Election Day Tuesday may not be convenient,” said San Diego County Registrar Michael Vu. “Weekend voting gives them yet another option to cast their ballots or drop off their mail ballots.”
In addition to the Registrar of Voters office, you may visit any of the Registrar’s four satellite voting locations from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 29 through Monday, March 2. They are also open on Election Day, when the voting hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. to reflect the hours at the polls.
Conditional voter registration now allows residents to register to vote and vote provisionally on Election Day at any polling place. That may cause long lines and waits at polling places. The satellite voting locations and Registrar’s office are better equipped to serve prospective voters and will have all ballot types in the election. The Registrar of Voters urges you to visit one of these five locations to vote early, especially if you need to register.
If you are registered nonpartisan, you will not have presidential candidates on your ballot. Learn the actions you need to take to vote for president.
If you are a mail voter but have decided to vote in person anyway, bring your mail ballot with you to turn in.
Act now. Putting this off until Election Day will likely cause delays and long lines.

78,County Urging Parents to Vaccinate Adolescent Children,"The human papilloma virus (HPV) is a common infection that can lead to certain types of cancer later in life, yet about 50% of adolescents in the nation don’t have the vaccine that can prevent it.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-urging-parents-to-vaccinate-adolescent-children/,2020-02-28T14:56:39-08:00,"
The human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common infection that can lead to certain types of cancer later in life, yet about 50% of adolescents in the nation don’t have the vaccine that can prevent it.
This is according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends that girls and boys get the HPV vaccine when they turn 11 or 12 to prevent six types of cancer later in life.
The HPV vaccine is one of several vaccinations recommended for adolescents that the County Health and Human Services Agency is raising awareness about as part of Preteen Vaccine Week from March 1-7.
“Vaccines are safe and effective and are the best protection we have to prevent disease,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Parents should speak with their medical provider to make sure their adolescent boys and girls have gotten the recommended vaccines.”
There are about 300,000 preteens and adolescents in San Diego County, and many of them have not had all the recommended vaccines. Making sure students have all the required vaccines is part of the countywide Live Well San Diego vision, an effort to improve the health and well-being of residents in the region.
The CDC recommends adolescent children get immunized against the following diseases:

HPV
Boys and girls need all shots in the series for full protection. HPV vaccine for girls and young women prevents cervical cancer. The vaccine is also recommended for boys to prevent anal cancer and genital warts.
Meningococcal disease
Meningococcal bacteria are known to cause serious illnesses in children and adolescents. The bacteria can infect the blood and cause inflammation of the tissues covering the brain and the spinal cord. Ten percent of teens who become ill die, and another 15 percent suffer long-term disability such as loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems or brain damage.
Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (grouped in one vaccine called Tdap)
All students entering 7thgrade need proof of a Tdap booster in order to attend school.
Influenza
The flu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months and older. Like most of the nation, San Diego County is currently going through a severe influenza season.
Chickenpox
Chickenpox, or varicella, is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. While chickenpox is a mild disease for most people, it can be life-threatening for some. Two doses are recommended.

The above vaccines are available at physician offices, community clinics, and many retail pharmacies. People without medical insurance can get vaccinated at one of the seven County locations; call 2-1-1 for a location nearest you.
For more information on vaccines, call the HHSA Immunization Branch at (866) 358-2966 or visit www.sdiz.org.

80,Election Results – When to Expect Them,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away. But counting ballots takes time, and the March 3 Presidential Primary Election is more complicated than past elections.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/election-results-when-to-expect-them-5/,2020-03-03T12:27:05-08:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away. But counting ballots takes time, and the March 3 Presidential Primary Election is more complicated than past elections. Here are some reasons why.

A record high number of registered voters: San Diego County has more than 1.8 million registered voters.
More mail ballots than ever before were issued by the Registrar’s office: over 1.35 million, and many voters do not turn them in until Election Day. As of March 2, only 354,887 voters have returned their mail ballots.
Conditional voter registration at the Registrar of Voter’s office and, new this election, at the polls and four satellite voting locations on Election Day. That means voters who missed the traditional registration deadline can still register to vote and cast a provisional ballot.

So what can you expect on Election Night?
The first set of results comes in shortly after 8 p.m. Those are ballots that were mailed in, submitted at mail ballot drop-off points or cast during early voting at the Registrar’s office or a satellite voting location before Election Day.
Election night, precinct ballots must be driven in from more than 1,548 polling places across the county.
Once at the Registrar’s office, ballots are scanned. As that’s done, the results will periodically be updated.
However, it may be midnight before all polling place ballots arrive at the Registrar’s. The final unofficial election night results may not come in until after 3 a.m.
But that covers only the ballots that can be counted immediately – probably around half of the vote.
They may predict how some races will turn out, but tight races will be up in the air.
Here’s what’s left.
Mail ballots. Hundreds of thousands dropped off at polls, drop-off locations, the Registrar’s office and satellite locations on Election Day. Plus, mail ballots sent right before or on Election Day. They have three days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots, which voters cast for a variety of reasons. They went to a polling place other than the one assigned. They signed up to vote by mail, then decided to go to a poll anyway, but didn’t bring their mail ballot with them. And those who register on Election Day, which is now possible at every polling place. We don’t know how many people will do that. But it adds to the number of provisional ballots.
For each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter was eligible to vote – and eligible to vote for the races they marked on the ballot.
Election workers must process, review and inspect every provisional, mail-in and damaged ballot. It’s a labor-intensive, time-consuming process.
“Between mail ballots and provisional ballots, a close race always comes to the very end,” said Vu. “We must do our due diligence to make sure everything is right.”
Some races may not be decided for several weeks.
However, the results must be certified 30 days after Election Day on April 2, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.

More San Diegans have died from influenza this season than in all of last season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Six more flu deaths were reported last week, bringing this season’s total to 80. In comparison, 77 San Diegans died from influenza last season. All but three of the people who have died from influenza this season had underlying medical conditions.
“It’s very unfortunate but influenza deaths do occur every flu season,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It’s important for people to get vaccinated since the flu season is not over yet.”
The number of lab-confirmed cases decreased again last week, when 784 cases were reported. That’s 431 fewer flu cases compared to the previous week when 1,215 cases were reported. To date, a total of 18,696 cases have been reported.
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Feb. 29, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (compared to 6% the previous week).
Total influenza deaths to date: 80 (compared to 44 at this time last season).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 18,696 (compared to 6,103 last season).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control

Be informed. Be prepared.
That’s what County and local health officials, business and school leaders want area residents to do should the novel coronavirus be detected in the region.
“It’s important for everyone to educate themselves and their family and be prepared in case the new coronavirus makes its way to San Diego County,” said Chairman Greg Cox, County Board of Supervisors. “It’s also important for people not to panic as the risk for this new virus and the disease that it causes continues to be low.”
County health officials have been busy urging residents, local municipalities, schools, businesses and community and religious organizations to prepare for a potential outbreak of the novel coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19.
Working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the California Department of Public Health, and the local medical community, the County Health and Human Services Agency has a plan in place to identify, isolate, inform and investigate a possible case of this respiratory illness.
“We are prepared and conducting enhanced surveillance for this new virus, just as we do for other communicable diseases,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer, at a news conference with local elected officials, school and business leaders. “We’re in communication with all the appropriate entities and have a response plan to deal with any potential case or outbreak.”
However, County and local leaders are urging their respective organizations to be prepared if the new coronavirus appears locally. Below is a list of things to do based on current CDC recommendations.
What Residents Can Expect If They Come Down With COVID-19
Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include:

fever
cough
shortness of breath/difficulty breathing

At this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure.
What Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19
It’s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.


Also, it is essential to plan now for community transmission of COVID-19 in our region. CDC has published “Interim Guidance: Get Your Household Ready for Coronavirus Disease.” Please note these following important tips to help residents prepare to respond to this public health threat.

Store a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.
Plan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.
If you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.
Create an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.
Have a plan in case your school, child care, or employer closes temporarily.
Talk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.

Planning now helps you act more effectively to protect you and your family if COVID-19 does occur locally.
How Schools Can Prepare for Novel Coronavirus 
Child care settings and schools can take steps to help stop or slow the spread of COVID-19:

Review, update and implement emergency operations plans in collaboration with the local health department and other relevant partners.
Make sure the plan includes strategies to reduce the spread of a wide variety of infectious diseases.
Monitor student and staff absences and alert local health officials of a spike of absences due to respiratory illnesses.
Ensure they know what to do, such as staying home when sick and appropriately covering coughs and sneezes.
Frequently clean surfaces such as doorknobs and desktops.

How Businesses Can Protect Their Employees from COVID-19
The CDC has issued the following interim guidance that may help prevent workplace exposures to COVID-19 should there be widespread exposures and community outbreaks:

Encourage sick employees to stay home if they have symptoms of acute respiratory illness.
Make sure your sick leave policies are flexible and consistent with public health guidance and that employees are aware of them.
Have a plan in place should a large number of employees get sick or need to work from home.
Sick leave policies should be flexible and permit employees to stay home if they need to care for a sick family member.
If an employee shows up to work sick or becomes sick during work hours, separate them and send them home.
Encourage sneezing and coughing etiquette and hand hygiene by all employees.
Perform routine cleaning of all frequently touched surfaces in the workplace, such as workstations, countertops and doorknobs.

Health officials emphasized that all county residents have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 in the region. If you have questions about COVID-19, call 2-1-1 to speak with a specially trained operator or visit www.coronavirus-sd.com.

Do you know of any teens in San Diego County who deserve recognition for something remarkable they do? The San Diego County Public Defender is seeking nominations through April 1 for teens ages 13 through 19 who are doing something extraordinary in 25 non-traditional categories, many of which showcase creativity or social activism.
“The 25 Most Remarkable Teens in San Diego program gives us an opportunity to recognize the many exceptional accomplishments of young people in our community,” said Public Defender Randy Mize. “Young people who are motivated, committed to their community, inspiring in their talents and skills, or who have shown the courage to confront and overcome adversity deserve to be recognized.  Kids doing remarkable things are often left in the shadows. I absolutely love this program.”
The nominations are reviewed by San Diego County Public Defender attorney advisors and the Public Defender Youth Council, a group of high school students working with the Public Defender’s Office to develop and implement youth civic engagement projects throughout San Diego.
All nominees will be given a personal interview and receive a certification of recognition for being nominated.
Some of the categories this year include youth activism, art, campus leadership, community service, courage to overcome adversity, public speaking, fashion design, writing, technology, photography, innovation and personal determination. To review all the categories, please link to  the fillable nomination form and consider submitting a nomination for a teen you know.
For some examples of what the selection committee is look for, here are the Most Remarkable Teens who were selected last year.
The 25 teens selected will receive their awards at a special ceremony on May 8 in the Neil Morgan Auditorium at the San Diego Central Library.  Awards will be presented by elected officials in the presence of parents, nominators, teachers, school administrators and community leaders.
Nomination forms must be completed and submitted no later than April 1. You can send it electronically to connie.howard@sdcounty.ca.gov or by mail to Connie Howard, San Diego County Public Defender Youth Council, 450 B St., Suite 1210, San Diego, CA 92101.

The National Weather Service says San Diego County could possibly get heavy rains next week, so this could be a good time for residents in unincorporated areas  to pick up some free sandbags to help protect their properties.
The County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are providing free sand and bags to residents in unincorporated areas at numerous fire stations around the county.
This winter has been pretty dry around the county, but the national weather service says that could change quickly Monday night, with possibly heavy rains around the county through Wednesday.
Rain can cause flooding and erosion, particularly in areas that aren’t covered by plants, landscaping, grass and trees.
Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.
Sand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.
People should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags. Some stations may have a limited supply.

87,"County Places Handwashing Stations, Takes Other COVID-19 Prevention Steps","While there has not been local transmission of the novel coronavirus, in order to lower the future risk of potential spread among people who are homeless, the County is placing handwashing stations in cities and unincorporated areas of the county, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-places-handwashing-stations-takes-other-covid-19-prevention-steps/,2020-03-09T16:28:52-07:00,"
While there has not been local transmission of the novel coronavirus, in order to lower the future risk of potential spread among people who are homeless, the County is placing handwashing stations in cities and unincorporated areas of the county, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
To date, 66 handwashing stations have been placed in the City of San Diego, in areas where people experiencing homelessness tend to gather. Six have been placed in Carlsbad and 14 in unincorporated areas of the county, primarily Lakeside, Spring Valley, Ramona and Fallbrook.
“Next to sequestering those who are ill, frequent and proper handwashing is one of the best ways to prevent COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We’re placing stations across the region so that people who are homeless can have a place to wash their hands with soap and water.”
In addition to the handwashing stations, the County is preparing to send Homeless Outreach Teams into the streets to educate people who are homeless on how to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and distribute supply kits that contain helpful information.
The County is increasing the public health nurse presence at the City of San Diego’s bridge shelters in order to screen people for symptoms of respiratory illness. It also will assess on an ongoing basis the need for support at other shelter locations. In addition, the county is preparing to enhance its ability to house people who might need to be quarantined.
HHSA health information specialists have been trained on how to provide COVID-19 presentations in the community for businesses, community and faith-based organizations.
On March 3, Wooten sent letters to all city managers informing them she was installing additional handwashing stations to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 locally.
The County is ready to procure, pay for and place temporary handwashing stations in areas that would benefit the most from this preventive measure.
Symptoms of COVID-19
Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include:

fever
cough
shortness of breath/difficulty breathing

At this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.
Through March 9, HHSA had placed 76 patients under investigation. Fifty-six have tested negative and 20 are pending. A total of 464 people have been placed under self-quarantine at home; 376 have finished their quarantine and 82 are currently being monitored. Six people ended up developing symptoms and became patients under investigation.
“We are monitoring these people daily and taking appropriate actions when they develop symptoms,” Wooten said. “It’s important to remember that if you did not have close contact to the patient with COVID-19, the risk of infection is still low.”
What Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19
It’s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

Residents should also follow these important tips to help prepare:

Store a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.
Plan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.
If you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.
Create an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.
Have a plan in case your school, child care, or employer closes temporarily.
Talk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.

Planning now helps you act more effectively to protect you and your family if COVID-19 does occur locally.

A San Diego County woman in her 50s is the first presumptive positive case of COVID-19 in the region, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The woman developed symptoms after traveling overseas. The woman was hospitalized and remains at a local hospital in isolation with serious symptoms.
Her test results came back positive late this afternoon at the County Public Health Laboratory, which is sending specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation.
HHSA is aggressively working to find out where she had been prior to being hospitalized and how many people had close contact with her. The appropriate people will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.
“We knew we would see cases in San Diego County and were prepared for them,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The public should be assured that we are following CDC guidance and continue taking appropriate steps to keep the novel coronavirus from spreading.”

89,TB Case Reported at Southwestern College; Case Not Related to Previous Exposures,"A person at Southwestern College has tested positive with tuberculosis and may have exposed others to the disease, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tb-case-reported-at-southwestern-college-case-not-related-to-previous-exposures/,2020-03-10T15:36:57-07:00,"
A person at Southwestern College has tested positive with tuberculosis and may have exposed others to the disease, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
HHSA is working closely with Southwestern College (SWC) officials to notify people who were possibly exposed to tuberculosis. This TB case is not related to previous exposures at the community college.
The period of possible exposure is from Sept. 10, 2019 to Feb. 21, 2020.  This incident is not associated with prior exposures.
Tuberculosis is transmitted from person to person through indoor air during prolonged contact with an infectious person. Most people who are exposed do not become infected.
“We are recommending that all the identified people get tested to make sure they are not infected,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can prevent the infectious form of the disease.”
HHSA and SWC will provide free testing to identified people at the college’s Student Health Services– Student Center, Room 601F, 900 Otay Lakes Rd., Chula Vista, CA 91910. Testing will be offered Wednesday & Friday from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. SCW employees will be tested by Occupational Health.
Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss. Tuberculosis can be treated and cured with medication. People who have TB symptoms or are immuno-compromised are encouraged to see their medical health care provider to rule out TB.
People who would like more information on this potential exposure are asked to call:

Southwestern Students Health Services at (619) 482-6354
County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621

Tuberculosis is not uncommon in the San Diego region but has been decreasing since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years.  In 2013, 206 cases were reported in the county, the lowest number since local TB cases peaked at 469 in 1993. There were 237 cases reported in 2017 and 226 in 2018.  Last year, 265 local residents were diagnosed with TB.

90,"San Diego Flu Deaths Reach 86, Cases Winding Down","Six additional influenza deaths were reported last week, bringing this season’s total to 86, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-flu-deaths-reach-86-cases-winding-down/,2020-03-11T13:08:25-07:00,"
Six additional influenza deaths were reported last week, bringing this season’s total to 86, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Only one of the deaths occurred last week, and all the people who died had underlying medical conditions.
The number of lab-confirmed cases continued to drop last week when 637 reports were received. That’s 135 fewer cases than the prior week.
“Influenza appears to be declining, but people should continue getting vaccinated as the flu could last until April or May,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccine is safe and effective and the best tool we have to prevent influenza.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending March 7, 2020, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (compared to 5% the previous week).
Total influenza deaths to date: 86 (compared to 46 at this time last season).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 19,317 (compared to 6,675 last season).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.

91,"Board Chairman Cox, County Unveil Online Census Kiosks at County Libraries","County Board of Supervisors Chairman Greg Cox, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and other officials unveiled new census laptop stations Thursday that will let the public fill out online census forms at all 33 County branch libraries.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/cox-county-unveil-online-census-kiosks-at-county-libraries/,2020-03-12T16:45:48-07:00,"
County Board of Supervisors Chairman Greg Cox, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and other officials unveiled new census laptop stations Thursday that will let the public fill out online census forms at all County of San Diego libraries.
Cox, Becerra and officials from the County library system, the San Diego Association of Governments and the Chula Vista Community Collaborative showed off the new census laptop stations at a press event at the County’s Bonita-Sunnyside branch library.
The census laptop stations will give people who may not have access to computers at home the ability to fill out the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2020 census questionnaire online. They will be placed at all 33 County library branches and in its two bookmobiles.
The 2020 census is the first that the U.S. Census Bureau is encouraging most people to answer online, although people will still be able to answer them by telephone or mail.
Cox said it’s extremely important for people to take part in the census, which is conducted every 10 years, because the federal government uses census data to distribute federal funds to local communities.
“Because of that,” Cox said, “we are all here to urge everyone to participate in the census so that San Diego gets its share of federal funding to address issues like public transportation, services for children and funding to address homelessness.”
County Board Chairman Greg Cox and California Attorney General Xavier Becerra unveil new online census kiosks to be placed at all County libraries.
Cox said the County has also placed census promotion banners in the County lobbies; is delivering census information to homebound seniors who have meals delivered by providers working with the County’s Aging and Independence program; has launched a census information webpage; and included census advertisements in the 1.8 million sample ballots the County sent to voters leading to the recent primary election.

92,"Social Distancing, Visiting Restrictions Established; Mass Gatherings Banned; 5 More Positive COVID-19 Cases Reported Locally","The County of San Diego today announced that social distancing and visiting restrictions have now been established countywide, and mass gatherings are being banned to slow the regional spread of novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/social-distancing-visiting-restrictions-established-mass-gatherings-banned-5-more-positive-covid-19-cases-reported-locally/,2020-03-12T16:50:17-07:00,"
The County of San Diego today announced that social distancing and visiting restrictions have now been established countywide, and mass gatherings are being banned to slow the regional spread of novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.
The new measures start at midnight and will last at least through the end of March. See the Health Officer order.
“Protecting the public’s health is our number one priority and we’re using every tool at our disposal to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The swift action to ban mass gatherings is one of several social distancing strategies that can be used to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.”
What are Social Distancing and Mass Gatherings?
Social distancing is an infection control action that public health officials take to stop or slow down the spread of a contagious disease. The goal is for people to avoid close contact with each other and stay six feet apart.
Therefore, starting today, all gatherings of more than 250 people are directed to be postponed or canceled across the county. Those gatherings include concerts, conferences, and professional, college and school sporting events.
Smaller events can proceed only if the organizers can implement social distancing of six feet between participants.
Gatherings of people who are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 should be limited to no more than 10 people, while also following social distancing guidelines. This includes gatherings at retirement facilities, assisted living facilities, developmental homes and support groups for people with health conditions.
Visitor Restrictions and Sick Leave Policy Due to COVID-19
The County has also issued a directive for health care settings serving people with high risk of complications from COVID-19. These facilities should implement aggressive visitor restrictions and enforce their sick leave policies, and include:

Hospitals providing acute, in-patient care
Long-term care facilities
Skilled-nursing facilities
Other residential facilities

5 Presumptive COVID-19 Cases Reported Locally
Five more San Diegans have tested presumptive positive for COVID-19, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
They are:

A woman in her 70s who travelled in the Diamond Princess cruise ship and is at home under isolation.
A woman in her 70s who is an evacuee from the Grand Princess cruise ship and is in a local hospital in isolation.
A man in his 40s who is under isolation at home and traveled to Colorado.
A man in his 50s who is in isolation at a local hospital and also traveled to Colorado (no connection).
A man in his 60s who is in a local hospital in isolation.

People who have tested positive and are in isolation at home are being monitored by County public health nurses. To date, there have been six presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in San Diego County.
Given what’s happening across the world, nation and state, the County is now preparing to deal with a possible outbreak of COVID-19 in the region.
That’s why it’s important for the public to be informed and prepared.
“Stay home if you are sick. Avoid contact with people who are sick,” Wooten said. “Also, practice good hand washing hygiene and stay away from large crowds.”
COVID-19 Testing
In addition to the County Public Health Lab, local hospital and private labs now have the capability to test for COVID-19.
Presumptive positive tests from hospital and private labs must still be confirmed by the County’s Public Health Lab, which in turn will send specimens to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for final confirmation.
The County has the capability to test 60 patients per day and results are typically known in 24 to 48 hours. The County is awaiting two additional instruments to be able to test more patients daily if necessary.
The County has two kits on hand, with each kit having the capability to test up to 600 patients.
What to Do if You Get Sick
Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection have reported symptoms ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness. Symptoms generally include fever, cough and shortness of breath/difficulty breathing
At this time, the CDC believes that symptoms of COVID-19 may appear in as few as two days, or as long as 14 days, after exposure.
If you may have had contact with a person with COVID-19 or recently traveled to countries with apparent community spread and start to experience symptoms, call your medical provider so that they can take appropriate precautions.

It’s official. The new Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk East County Branch Office and Archive in Santee formally celebrated its grand opening with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Thursday.
The new 25,000-square-foot building features a first for the County – County Archives. Historic documents dating back 170 years now have a dedicated space of their own. Some 4,400 cubic feet of archival records and microfilm moved from offsite storage to a repository with its own generator, heating and air conditioning system, state of the art fire suppression system and secure access.
“Documents include maps, deeds, historic birth, marriage and death certificates, and other official records dating back to 1850,” said Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk Ernest J. Dronenburg, Jr. “The archives will offer county residents and other users the opportunity to conduct research and view publicly available documents, either electronically or by appointment, based on their physical condition.”
The County’s first-ever archivist will manage the repository and help the public gain access to the historic documents.
The site of the one-story structure features 125 parking spaces under solar panel canopies, an outdoor wedding arbor and indoor marriage room. The County’s Treasurer/Tax Collector’s office will also offer limited services.
The County Archive is the first zero net energy archive in the nation and the County’s sixth zero net energy facility, meaning all the energy needed to run the building will be produced onsite.   The overall facility was also built to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design gold standards.

95,3 More COVID-19 Cases Reported in San Diego County; Healthy People Don’t Need to Be Tested,"Three additional people have tested presumptive positive for COVID-19, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/3-more-covid-19-cases-reported-in-san-diego-county-healthy-people-dont-need-to-be-tested/,2020-03-13T18:23:02-07:00,"
Three additional people have tested presumptive positive for COVID-19, the Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
The new COVID-19 cases are:

A man in his 40s who is hospitalized and in isolation and traveled to New York and Philadelphia.
A man in his 30s who is in isolation at home and traveled to Chicago.
A woman in her 70s who is at home in isolation.

To date, there have been 11 cases in San Diego County: eight of them local residents and three from the federal quarantine.
HHSA is aggressively working to find out where these patients were prior to developing symptoms and testing positive for COVID-19. Any contacts determined to be at risk will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.
“We anticipated that more cases would be reported. We also expect community spread of COVID-19 to occur, if it hasn’t already,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The public should be assured that we are following CDC guidance and taking aggressive measures to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.”
Not Everyone Needs to Be Tested
When it comes to testing, the County is following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health. Hospital and commercial laboratories establish their own guidelines, but some doctors are consulting with County Public Health Services to determine if a patient should be tested.
While the public’s desire for testing is understandable, for now, testing is primarily through health care systems, which typically involve a visit with a provider. The public is urged to work within their individual health care programs. People who are not sick don’t need to be tested.
If you are sick and would not normally see a health care provider, stay home until you are no longer sick.
“If you are sick enough to consult a doctor, call them and let them know and take precautions before going in for health care,” Wooten said.
Here’s who should be tested:

People returning from an impacted country who develop symptoms.
People who have had contact with someone who tested positive with COVID-19.
People who are experiencing severe respiratory illness.

Testing does not affect treatment as there is no treatment for COVID-19, except supportive care, such as fever or cough medications. Testing is used to help with very sick patients who are hospitalized.
“People who are sick should isolate themselves and stay six feet away from healthy people,” Wooten said.
Measures to Slow COVID-19
The County has taken aggressive measures to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, including:

Banning gatherings of 250 or more people and requiring additional social distancing measures.
Establishing strict visitor restrictions at hospitals, long-term and skilled-nursing facilities and other residential facilities.
Increasing testing capacity at the County Public Health Lab and considering additional testing options.
Placing handwashing stations throughout the region.
Dispatching Homeless Outreach Teams with information and protocols for people who are homeless.
Sending public health nurses to homeless shelters to monitor people for respiratory illness.
Identifying hotel/motel rooms to house people without a home and who might need to be quarantined.

The County is actively monitoring all people under home isolation and quarantine to make sure they don’t develop symptoms of COVID-19.
“We check on these people daily and take appropriate actions when they develop symptoms,” Wooten said. “It’s important to remember that if you did not have close contact to the patient with COVID-19 or someone who’s traveled to an impacted country or region, the risk of infection is still low.”
What Residents Can Do to Prepare for COVID-19
It’s important for the public to be prepared should a COVID-19 outbreak occur in San Diego County. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

Residents should also follow these important tips to help prepare to respond to this public health threat.

Store a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.
Plan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.
If you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.
Create an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.
Have a plan in case your school, child care, or employer closes temporarily.
Talk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.

Planning now helps you act more effectively to protect you and your family if COVID-19 does occur locally.

97,County Widens Ban on Gatherings; COVID-19 Cases Reach 55,"As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in the region and the virus starts to spread in our communities, the County today issued new guidance to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-widens-ban-on-gatherings-covid-19-cases-reach-55/,2020-03-16T17:15:22-07:00,"
As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase in the region and the virus starts to spread in our communities, the County today issued new guidance to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
To date, a total of 55 cases have been reported in the region — 47 in San Diego County residents, four from the federal quarantine and four in non-residents.
To slow the spread of COVID-19, the following guidance is being issued and is effective from March 17 through March 31, 2020:

All public and private gatherings of more than 50 people are prohibited. Non-essential gatherings of any size are strongly discouraged.
All bars and adult entertainment establishments that serve alcohol and no food must close.
All restaurants or businesses that serve food must close on-site dining. Food delivery, pick-up or drive-through needs to be done using social distancing or keeping people six feet apart.
All schools of all grades to close; students who are minors must stay at home and not participate in activities prohibited by the order.
All people 65 or older, or anyone who has a chronic underlying condition or are immunocompromised should stay home.
Non-essential personnel must stay away from hospitals or long-term care facility.
All businesses need to enact social distancing, increase cleaning standards and have employees work from home, if possible. Businesses must suspend doctor verification for sick or other leave approval.
Hospitals must preserve resources and delay non-emergency surgeries and elective procedures.

“We are taking these measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and keep our health care system from being overwhelmed,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “There is now community spread of COVID-19 and the public needs to heed these measures to avoid contracting the virus.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is aggressively working to do contact tracing of all the patients who have tested positive for COVID-19. The appropriate people will be placed under self-quarantine and monitored for possible symptoms of COVID-19.
All people returning from the list of impacted countries —South Korea, Japan, Italy, China and Iran, and others added to the list — need to follow a 14-day home quarantine to keep the virus from spreading in case they are infected.
“People should remain at home to monitor for symptoms and no go out in public,” Wooten said.
Flattening the Curve
As the number of COVID-19 cases continues to increase across the nation, the state and the County, health officials are closing schools, businesses and other institutions to try to flatten the curve of the pandemic.
The goal is to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the pandemic so that many people don’t get sick at the same time and overwhelm the health care system. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.
“By slowing the spread of the virus, new cases won’t occur all at once,” Wooten said. “Hospitals and health care systems can adjust and be able to handle all people who might get sick and need to be hospitalized.”
What Residents Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19
It’s important for the public to take measures to reduce chances of getting and spreading the disease. To limit the spread of infection, you should:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

Residents should also follow these important tips to help both prepare and respond to this public health threat.

Store a two-week supply of food, beverages and water, including food for family pets. Ensure an adequate supply of prescribed and routine medications are on hand.
Plan ways to care for those who are at greater risk for serious complications and who will take care of sick family members.
If you have family members with increased risk of getting seriously sick, check with your medical providers about symptoms and treatment.
Create an emergency contact list of family and friends, teachers and employers.
Have a plan in case your school, childcare, or employer closes temporarily.
Talk with your children, family, and friends about what to do if an outbreak occurs and what each person would need.

Following these steps now helps protect you and your family.

98,County Libraries Move to Digital to Help Stop Coronavirus,"County library branches are going to curb-side pickup to help county residents practice social-distancing to stop the spread of coronavirus and still enjoy all the library books, digital magazines, music, movies and other fare they love.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-libraries-move-to-curb-side-pickups-to-help-stop-coronavirus/,2020-03-17T13:09:48-07:00,"
Editor’s Note: Due to the quickly moving nature of the County’s response to the novel coronavirus and to protect the public, County libraries will not be able to provide curbside pickup of books and library materials.
However, library patrons can still digitially access all the Library’s e-books and e-magazines around the clock — 24 hours a day, seven days a week — by downloading the Libby app for e-books or Flipster (under e-books and e-magazines) for e-magazines like Sports Illustrated, People, Time.
Residents who do not have a library card, can sign up for an Instant Digital Card and use their mobile phone number as their library card!
The County of San Diego’s libraries are going to curb-side pickup to help county residents practice social-distancing to stop the spread of coronavirus and still enjoy all the library books, digital magazines, music, movies and other fare they love.
Starting Wednesday, March 18, County library patrons can use the Library’s online catalog or call their branch libraries, place orders for the books they’re looking for and then pick them up at the Library’s curbside weekdays between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. when the material is ready.
At the same, County Library Director Migell Acosta said library patrons can still access all the Library’s e-books and e-magazines around the clock — 24 hours a day, seven days a week — by downloading the Libby app for e-books or Flipster (under e-books and e-magazines) for e-magazines like Sports Illustrated, People, Time. The New York Times and other reference resources are available on our website.
County libraries are moving to the curb-side pickup to help the public deal with calls from the federal, state and the County Public Health Officer to stay at home, away from crowds and practice social-distancing to stop the spread of novel coronavirus, which can cause the disease COVID-19.
Acosta said using curbside pickup will be easy to use. Residents with County library cards can go to the Library website sdcl.org, use the catalog search to find the books or materials they’re looking for, then place their order right then online, or call their respective library to place their order.
Library staff will then send patrons an email letting them know when their books are ready for them to call ahead and pick them up at the curbside, again, from 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday.
All of the library’s online resources can be accessed here. Residents who do not have a library card, can sign up for an Instant Digital Card and use their mobile phone number as their library card. To download the Libby app, San Diego County residents can go to sdEbooks.org. Library patrons can even order books and materials that are available at any of the County’s 33 branch libraries and have them delivered to their own branch library for them to pick up.
The County Library system also announced this week that under guidance from the state and County Public Health Officer it was canceling all library-sponsored and co-sponsored events, programs and classes through the end of March to help stop the spread of novel coronavirus.

The system allows County health officials to send real-time information about COVID-19 in the region. To sign up to receive the messages, text COSD COVID19 to 468-311.
The system was set up to let County public health officials issue information and instructions on changes related to COVID-19 in the region.
Flattening the Curve
County health officials are requiring residents not working and students out of school to stay at home to avoid contracting COVID-19. They should only be out to get food or other essential needs, such as caring for a relative, getting medical attention, picking up prescriptions or to go to work.
“We all have a role to play to keep the virus from spreading in our communities,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should not be out and about, unless it’s absolutely necessary and people are not in a group.”
Wooten issued the new guidance March 16 to try to flatten the curve of the pandemic and prevent many people from getting sick at the same time.
The goal is to practice social distancing to slow the spread of the pandemic so that sick people don’t overwhelm the healthcare system. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.
“People should be six feet apart when out on the street conducting essential activities,” Wooten said. “Social distancing is an effective tool to slow the spread of pandemics.”

Effective Thursday, March 19, the County’s Family Resource Centers, as well as the Housing and Community Development Services office are temporarily suspending in-person services. The closures are intended to help county residents practice social-distancing to stop the spread of COVID-19.
While these physical offices are closing, the County is committed to continue providing its services during the ongoing health emergency. Most services provided at these facilities are available online, and staff will continue to answer questions via phone or email.
Residents looking to apply for essential services, including food and housing assistance, medical coverage and other vital support programs, can apply for benefits online. They can also call 2-1-1 San Diego and a live representative can help with the application process by phone.
San Diegans who are already signed up for benefits, including CalWORKs, CalFresh, Medi-Cal or General Relief benefits, can manage their case online. Existing customers can send required documents electronically via LaterDocs.
For those who are not able to submit forms electronically, a limited number of staff members will be available outside the County’s 13 Family Resource Centers.

103,County Officials Give COVID-19 Update in Wake of Governor’s “Stay Home” Order,County officials re-emphasized California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new coronavirus message a day after he issued a statewide “stay home order to stop the spread of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-officials-update-covid-19-in-wake-of-governors-stay-home-order/,2020-03-20T20:05:31-07:00,"
County officials re-emphasized California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new coronavirus message a day after he issued a statewide “stay home” order to stop the spread of the virus that causes the COVID-19 disease.
“The message is very clear,” County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., said. “All Californians are being asked to stay at home if you do not need to go out for essential reasons.”
Essential reasons include buying food, picking up medications and even exercising as long as people do so by practicing social-distancing and keeping six feet apart from individuals other than your household members.
Wooten and other County officials also said the number of San Diego County’s COVID-19 cases continues to rise. But they added that everyone in the general public does not need to get tested for the virus.
“Eighty percent of individuals who get COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms,” Wooten said. “Those individuals can isolate and stay home. If they develop more advanced symptoms, they should call their doctor.”
Wooten and Dr. Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., the medical director of the County’s Epidemiology and Immunization Branch, said that 80% recover without incident and their situations would not be changed by being tested. They said coronavirus testing should be reserved for the smaller percentage of individuals who present with severe symptoms and are hospitalized.
Governor’s Order
Supervisor Nathan Fletcher said the County continues working with the state to gain a better understanding of the Governor’s detailed order. Newsom’s order said everyone had to stay home, except people in “essential” jobs, defined by the federal Department of Homeland Security’s “Critical Infrastructure Sectors.”
Fletcher said those generally reflected things like police, fire, utilities, government, grocery stores, banks, hospitals, transit systems and critical businesses like biotech.
Staying at Home
Fletcher and the doctors said there were exceptions to the stay at home rule that allowed people to shop for groceries and essential household items, as well as engage in physical activity.
“There are a number of things that are clear you can do,” Fletcher said. “Go to the gas station, go to the pharmacy, go to the grocery store, go to the bank. You can go outside for a walk. You can take your family unit who you live with in your home … and go to a field or an open park for play. You can use all the technology we have to stay connected to your loved ones and friends who are around you.”
County Public Health Orders Remain in Place
However, Fletcher and Wooten also said people — even those in essential services — had to continue to follow the public health orders:

People are encouraged not to gather in groups of any size unless it’s absolutely necessary.
Day care must be limited to groups of up to 10 children in the same room and must remain in the same group each day with the same staff person.
People 65 years of age and older, or anyone who has a chronic underlying condition or who is immunocompromised, should stay home.
Hospitals must conserve resources and delay non-emergency surgeries and elective procedures.

Business ordered closed include:

Bars and adult-entertainment establishments that serve alcohol and not food;
Restaurants must close dining-areas, but may serve food for take-out, drive-through, or delivery;
Schools; and
Gyms and fitness centers.

Social Distancing to Flatten the Curve 
Gov. Newsom’s order came as public health officials around the globe have been urging people to “flatten the curve” of the novel coronavirus by staying home and keeping six feet away from others. That would keep the virus from racing through populations, making everyone sick in a huge spike that could overwhelm hospitals and healthcare systems.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home — parents working remotely and students taking classes on line. Businesses should also practice social distancing by keeping employees and customers at least six feet apart, if in an essential job, as well as working remotely, if possible.
People can go out to get food or other essentials, assist a family member or friend, get medical attention, pick up medications, or go to work as an “essential” employee.
Local COVID-19 Cases
Through 5 p.m. Friday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 131 — up by 26 from Thursday — with no deaths.
Of the 131 cases 110 were San Diego County residents and 10 were non-residents. Cases under federal quarantine also increased to 11, up by three from Thursday.
Eighty-three of the 131 cases were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 14 were between 50 and 59; and 32 were 60 or older. The County’s daily coronavirus in San Diego webpage now also breaks down the number of cases by city and unincorporated communities.
What Everyone Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19
People can help limit the spread of infection, by taking these steps:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

104,County Officials Remind Public to Remain Vigilant,The County reinforced Gov. Gavin Newsom's executive order to shelter at home and provided new details about its response efforts at a news conference today.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-officials-reminds-public-to-remain-vigilant/,2020-03-21T19:30:37-07:00,"
The County reinforced Gov. Gavin Newsom’s executive order to shelter at home and provided new details about its response efforts at a news conference today.
County Office of Emergency Services Director Jeff Toney said the majority of the county’s 18 cities have proclaimed local emergencies.
“This is an all-time record for any emergency within the County,” said Toney. “This shows you that COVID-19 is affecting everyone.”
Toney said the County is leaning forward to build capacity and capability, as well as support our medical professionals, focusing on a community approach to keep San Diego residents safe and healthy. He also thanked the agencies involved in the response, many of which have representatives at the County Emergency Operations Center, including the governor’s Office of Emergency Services, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Sheriff’s Department, County Fire, San Diego Police Department, the American Red Cross, 2-1-1 San Diego, the County Office of Education and many community and faith-based organizations.
Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten emphasized the importance of the governor’s order and reminded residents that it is safer to stay at home.
“I ask you again both personally and as the Public Health Officer that we come together in a collective manner to begin to bend the curve. Every one of us has a vital role in this goal,” said Dr. Wooten.
Supervisor Nathan Fletcher also provided further clarification on the governor’s stay-at-home directive. He said essential services include restaurant carry out and quick service food operations, workers supporting childcare establishments, and construction workers as well as commercial retail stores that supply essential sectors such as convenience stores, pet supply stores, auto supply and repair, hardware and home improvement.  See the full list of essential critical infrastructure workers.
County Public Health Orders Remain in Place
People — even those in essential services — should continue to follow the public health orders:

People are encouraged not to gather in groups of any size unless it’s necessary.
Day care must be limited to groups of up to 10 children in the same room and must remain in the same group each day with the same staff person.
People 65 years of age and older, or anyone who has a chronic underlying condition or who is immunocompromised, should stay home.

Hair and nail salons

Social Distancing to Flatten the Curve 
Public health officials are urging people to “flatten the curve” of the novel coronavirus by staying home and keeping at least six feet away from other people unless they’re family. That would keep the virus from racing through populations, making everyone sick in a huge spike that could overwhelm hospitals and healthcare systems.

People can go out to get food or other essentials, assist a family member or friend, get medical attention, pick up medications, or go to work as an “essential” employee.
Local COVID-19 Cases 
Through 5 p.m. Saturday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 159 — up by 28 from Friday — with no deaths.
Of the 159 cases 135 were San Diego County residents and 13 were non-residents. Cases under federal quarantine remained the same at 11.
Of the 159 cases, 102 were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 18 were between 50 and 59; and 36 were 60 or older. The County’s daily coronavirus in San Diego webpage now also breaks down the number of cases by city and unincorporated communities.

105,First San Diego County Resident Dies from COVID-19,The County announced the first death of a San Diego County resident from COVID-19 during a news conference Sunday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/first-san-diego-county-resident-dies-from-covid-19/,2020-03-22T19:08:58-07:00,"
The County announced the first death of a San Diego County resident from COVID-19 during a news conference Sunday.
A man in his early 70s died in Santa Clara County after traveling to Hawaii. More information was not released for confidentiality reasons.
County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., reminded the public that for the sake of public safety, they should adhere to the governor’s executive order to stay at home. Many residents are following the order, but others are gathering at beaches and other locations, and ignoring recommendations about social distancing.
“Please, I implore you, to not gather with any non-household groups. Please adhere to the six-foot social distancing rule when you are in areas with non-household members,” said Wooten. “Per the governor’s order, not following the order is a misdemeanor subject to a $1,000 fine.”
If residents have concerns about gathering, they’re asked to use their judgment and if need be, call the non-emergency number in their community to contact local enforcement.
Meanwhile, the region received good news in regard to beds and medical supplies for COVID-19. Late yesterday, the state announced San Diego County has been selected for a mobile field hospital which could provide up to 250 additional beds in the region.
Tomorrow the federal government is expected to deliver through the state face shields and gowns to help local medical staff. The County’s Medical Operations Center will begin filling requests from local medical facilities for protective wear immediately after the supplies arrive.
County residents are reminded that most people do not need to wear a mask if they don’t have any symptoms of the disease.
“If you’re not symptomatic, don’t wear a mask,” said Medical Operations Center Director Rob Sills. “When someone does not have symptoms and they wear a mask, it takes a mask away from providers who are providing care to our patients.”
A call also went out to health care professionals who are no longer working and have time to give. They are asked to volunteer to help with the COVID-19 response by visiting healthcarevolunteers.ca.gov.
Meantime, the governor’s stay-at-home directive allows for essential services to continue operating. They include restaurant carry-out and quick service food operations, workers supporting childcare establishments, and construction workers as well as commercial retail stores that supply essential sectors such as convenience stores, pet supply stores, auto supply and repair, hardware and home improvement.  See the full list of essential critical infrastructure workers.
County Public Health Orders Remain in Place
People — even those in essential services — should continue to follow the public health orders:

People are encouraged not to gather in groups of any size unless it’s necessary.
Day care must be limited to groups of up to 10 children in the same room and must remain in the same group each day with the same staff person.
People 65 years of age and older, or anyone who has a chronic underlying condition or who is immunocompromised, should stay home.
Hospitals must conserve resources and delay non-emergency surgeries and elective procedures.

Business ordered closed include:

Bars and adult-entertainment establishments that serve alcohol and not food
Restaurants must close dining-areas, but may serve food for take-out, drive-through, or delivery
Schools
Gyms and fitness centers
Hair and nail salons

Social Distancing to Flatten the Curve
Public health officials are urging people to “flatten the curve” of the novel coronavirus by staying home and keeping at least six feet away from other people unless they’re family. That would keep the virus from racing through populations, making everyone sick in a huge spike that could overwhelm hospitals and healthcare systems.
Flattening the curve. Mitigation efforts can help reduce the number of daily cases and the pressure on the healthcare system.
People can practice social distancing by staying at home — parents working remotely and students taking classes online. Businesses should also practice social distancing by keeping employees and customers at least six feet apart, if in an essential job, as well as working remotely, if possible.
People can go out to get food or other essentials, assist a family member or friend, get medical attention, pick up medications, or go to work in jobs designated essential.
Local COVID-19 Cases
Through 5 p.m. Sunday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 205 — up by 46 from Saturday — with one death of a San Diego County resident who was hospitalized in Santa Clara County.
Of the 205 cases 178 were San Diego County residents and 11 were non-residents. Cases under federal quarantine remained the same at 11.
Of the 205 cases, three are between 10 and 19 years old, 131 were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 27 were between 50 and 59; and 44 were 60 or older. The County’s webpage tracking COVID-19 cases in San Diego now includes the number of cases by city and unincorporated communities.
What Everyone Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19
People can help limit the spread of infection, by taking these steps:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfectfrequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

106,Public Health Order Amended to Allow Shutdown of Beaches,The County has issued an amended COVID-19 public health order giving it the discretion to close down beaches if social distancing rules aren’t enforced. County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten made the announcement during a news conference Monday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/public-health-order-amended-to-allow-shutdown-of-beaches/,2020-03-23T19:46:59-07:00,"
The County has issued an amended COVID-19 public health order giving it the discretion to close down beaches if social distancing rules aren’t enforced. County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten made the announcement during a news conference Monday.
Gatherings larger than 10 people have been seen at beaches in recent days. Wooten said if local cities and municipalities cannot enforce social gathering orders, the public health order will allow the shutdown of city parks and beaches.
Social distancing requires staying six feet away from others who are not in your immediate family to reduce the risk of transmission and slow the spread of the disease.
Cases Rise to 230
Through 5 p.m. Monday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 230, with one death of a San Diego County resident reported yesterday.
Of the 230 cases 213 were San Diego County residents and 17 were non-residents.
Of the 230 cases, three are between 10 and 19 years old, 156 were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 32 were between 50 and 59; and 38 were 60 or older. The County’s daily coronavirus in San Diego webpage now also breaks down the number of cases by city and unincorporated communities.
Testing
When it comes to testing, Wooten reminded residents that 80% of people who get COVID-19 will have mild to moderate symptoms. They can self-isolate and stay home. They do not need to be tested. If symptoms become worse, you should call your doctor.
“This action, staying at home if you have mild to moderate symptoms, helps to protect our health care workers and decreases their use of personal protective equipment,” said Wooten.
Public Health Nurse Line 
The County has set up a nurse triage line to help 2-1-1 callers who have coronavirus symptoms.
“If you don’t have a medical provider, but you have some symptoms, we urge you to call 2-1-1 and ask for the nurses’ line,” said Supervisor Greg Cox. “It’ll be safer for you and others than going to a crowded emergency room or urgent care center.”
The Public Health Nurse Line is available seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. After hours, callers can leave a voice mail and a nurse will return the call within 24 hours.
Mental Health Precautions
The COVID-19 disease is prompting many residents to take physical precautions, but  maintaining their mental health may be another matter.
“There’s a lot of fear, a lot of uncertainty around what’s happening right now with the COVID virus, we also have looming economic difficulties that we know is associated with increased rates of depression and substance use,” said Behavioral Health Services Director Dr. Luke Bergman. “So it’s extremely important that as people start to experience those feelings that they address them now.”
Bergman says residents can get help if they need it. If you have a medical emergency, call 911. But if you’re experiencing a mental health crisis, call the Access and Crisis Line at 888-724-7240.
He also outlined some ways to support your mental health:

Maintain meal, exercise and bedtime routines.
Connect with others safely using technology.
Stay informed but avoid too much news.
Share your concerns with friends and family.

More information is available at the County’s Behavioral Health Services website.

107,Second Local COVID-19 Death Reported,"A second San Diego County resident has died from COVID-19, and two infants have been diagnosed with the disease.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/second-local-covid-19-death-reported/,2020-03-24T18:59:08-07:00,"
A second San Diego County resident has died from COVID-19, and two infants have been diagnosed with the disease.
Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., reported during a news conference Tuesday that the 76-year-old man had significant health issues. Wooten also noted the first two San Diego County cases of coronavirus disease in infants, a 6-week-old boy and a 4-month-old girl. Both are currently isolated in their homes.
Cases are increasing daily and Wooten doesn’t expect a downturn anytime soon.
“Things are likely to get worse before they get better. We do not believe that the local wave of COVID-19 cases has yet crested,” said Wooten. “It’s incumbent upon on all of us to do our part to flatten the curve.”
Cases Rise to 242
Through 5 p.m. Tuesday, the County total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 242, 12 more than Monday. Two San Diego County residents have died.
Of the total, 226 were San Diego County residents and 16 were non-residents.
Of the 242 cases, two are less than 9 years old, three are between 10 and 19 years old, 163 were people between the ages of 20 and 49; 33 were between 50 and 59; and 41 were 60 or older. The County’s daily coronavirus in San Diego webpage now also breaks down the number of cases by city and unincorporated communities.
Health Order Enforcement
At the news conference, Sheriff Bill Gore said his department has not issued any citations for violations of the state and county’s public health orders that close certain businesses and require social distancing.
“We’re choosing instead to get voluntary compliance and so far, that’s what we received,” Gore said.
If that changes, the Sheriff’s Department will start to issue citations, which carry up to a $1,000 fine and six months in jail.
COVID-19 County Response Update
County Supervisors were updated on the County’s response to COVID-19 during a board meeting Tuesday.

Testing: The County will soon get additional testing kits to augment those coming from the CDC. Testing is conducted at the County Public Health Lab, hospitals and commercial labs. Six hospitals also offer lab testing, and another is expected by the end of the week. Two nationwide commercial labs, Quest and LabCorp are actively testing as well. Public health nurses began offering drive-through testing by referral only on March 13. So far, 26 people have been tested.
Supplies: The County is low on face shields, gowns and goggles but supplies from the national stockpile are expected Tuesday. The County’s Medical Operations Center is in constant contact with hospitals and is filling supply requests daily.
Shelter and Care: The County developed a temporary lodging system for the general population and those experiencing homelessness who require isolation because of COVID-19. They must be referred by County nurses at the shelters, homeless outreach teams or health care providers. The County has about 2,000 hotels rooms in the region.
Flattening the Curve: The County is actively trying to flatten the curve of cases and deaths from COVID-19. Wooten told the Board if nothing is done, the curve spikes increasing the number of deaths and overburdening the health system. If people follow guidelines to stay home, the curve flattens. COVID-19 cases extend along a greater time period, but the health system can manage the pandemic leading to fewer cases and deaths, until a vaccine and anti-viral medications can be produced.

County Board Actions Tuesday
The County Board of Supervisors voted to:

Protect tenants, homeowners and small businesses in the unincorporated area that cannot pay rent because of the COVID-19 pandemic with a moratorium on evictions. The County will also work with financial institutions to provide similar protections for those facing foreclosure.
Defer County fees for most local food facilities that had to close, limit services and suffered financial losses because of the COVID-19 public health order. Health permit renewals, late fees and food plan review correction fees submitted before March 1 do not have to be paid until Sept. 1. While grocery stores and markets are allowed to continue operating under the order, other food and beverage industry operations such as restaurants, bars, breweries, caterers, mobile food facilities and schools need support to recover.
Approve $10 million to cover COVID-19 related costs.

What Everyone Can Do to Minimize Chances of Getting COVID-19
People can help limit the spread of infection, by taking these steps:

Wash your hands often to help protect you from germs.
Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, if soap and water are not available. It should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
If you are sick, stay home and keep your distance from others to protect them from getting sick too.
Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, then wash your hands.
Practice other good health habits. Get plenty of sleep, be physically active, manage your stress, drink plenty of fluids and eat nutritious food.

109,COVID-19 Testing Still Limited; Not Everyone Needs to Be Tested,"As the number of cases continues to increase and community transmission is becoming more widespread, more San Diegans are wondering why the local medical community is not testing everyone who might have COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-testing-still-limited-not-everyone-needs-to-be-tested/,2020-03-25T19:25:47-07:00,"
As the number of cases continues to increase and community transmission is becoming more widespread, more San Diegans are wondering why the local medical community is not testing everyone who might have COVID-19.
The answer: Testing is still limited and primarily for people at higher risk of complications from COVID-19, and not everyone needs to get tested for the novel coronavirus.
“Testing for COVID-19 is still limited so we are prioritizing people who need it the most,” said Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “About 80% of people who get COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms and don’t need to be tested.
Who Should Be Tested?
At the moment, COVID-19 testing is being considered for people who have a fever and a cough and are part of the following:

Have a lower respiratory illness and no other potential cause, especially if they are hospitalized
People living in a senior living facility, including nursing facilities or assisted living facilities
People who are elderly
People in congregate settings, such as homeless shelters
Health care workers, first responders and other emergency workers

Close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases who develop symptoms are likely to be positive for the disease as well. Testing is not required if the patient is not severely ill, not in a priority population, or not at high risk for complications.
“Testing people who have mild or moderate symptoms, but are not at higher risk of severe complications depletes testing resources and scarce personal protective equipment and exposes other patients and health care personnel to COVID-19,” Wooten said, adding that this recommendation might change when testing is more widely available.
So, what should you do if you think you have COVID-19 symptoms?
Stay at home.
If you’ve had symptoms, the recommendation is for you to stay home under the following conditions:

At least three days (72 hours) have passed since recovery, defined as resolution of fever without the use of fever-reducing medications and improvement in respiratory symptoms such as cough or shortness of breath; and
At least seven days have passed since symptoms first appeared.

“We all should we doing everything we can to flatten the curve since this is a life-saving action,” Wooten said.
If you have questions about COVID-19 testing, please talk to your healthcare provider or call 2-1-1 to talk to a public health nurse.
Cases Rise to 297
The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases increased to 297 Wednesday, 55 more than the previous day. No additional deaths were reported.
Of the 297 cases, 277 were San Diego County residents and 20 were non-residents. Starting Thursday, the non-residents will be dropped from the table to conform with the practices of other health departments across the state. The number of cases connected to the federal quarantine is no longer included in the County’s total.

110,Third COVID-19 Death Reported in San Diego,"An 87-year-old woman is the latest San Diegan to die from complications from COVID-19, bringing the region’s total to three, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/third-covid-19-death-reported-in-san-diego/,2020-03-26T18:07:57-07:00,"
An 87-year-old woman is the latest San Diegan to die from complications from COVID-19, bringing the region’s total to three, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
“The loss of life is always a tragic occurrence,” said Dr. Nick Yphantides, County chief medical officer, adding that the woman had underlying medical conditions. “Our condolences go out the woman’s family and loved ones.”
Earlier today, County health officials continued to urge San Diegans to remain at home to prevent contracting the novel coronavirus and potentially exposing others to COVID-19.
All the guidelines being issued will help prevent many people from getting sick at the same time and “flatten the curve” of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don’t overwhelm health care systems. Should that occur, there might not be enough hospital beds or mechanical respirators for everyone who needs them.
But being at home, does not necessarily mean you should not go out entirely.
You can go out to:

Get food and other essential needs. Plan so you make as few trips out as possible.
Care for a family member, relative or friend
Get medical attention
Pick up medications
Walk your dog
Go for a walk if you only do it with people living with you
Work if you’re an essential employee

County COVID-19 Cases Reach 341
County officials also revealed some new statistics on COVID-19. To date:

More than 4,000 San Diegans have been tested, resulting in 341 local cases, including 64 new cases reported today. The County’s total no longer includes non-residents to avoid double counting in the state.
More than 543,000 personal protective equipment items have been distributed to the local medical community, including 423,805 N-95 respirators.
More than 2,000 hotel rooms have been secured to isolate people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms and people who are vulnerable and have no place to live.
257 handwashing stations have been placed throughout the region and bathrooms are also being ordered.
County Homeless Outreach Teams have distributed 1,785 hygiene kits among people who are homeless.

Three more San Diegans have died from complications of COVID-19, bringing the region’s total to six, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The fourth and fifth deaths were:

A man in his 50s with underlying medical conditions
A man in his 80s with underlying medical conditions

A sixth death, a man in his 20s, will officially be reported tomorrow, but was announced today.
“COVID-19 deaths are very tragic and unfortunate, especially when a person who dies is a young healthy person,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Our sympathies and condolences go out to the families of these individuals.”
The passing of the young man in his 20s, who had no known preexisting health conditions, is evidence that COVID-19 affects all age groups and even the healthy, noted Dr. Wooten.
County health officials are asking the public to remain at home, especially now that community spread is increasing in the region.
“We must make every effort to protect ourselves and everyone around us,” Wooten said.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don’t overwhelm the local health care system.
The goal is to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for more sick people.
San Diego COVID-19 Cases Reach 417
Through March 27, a total of 417 COVID-19 cases have been reported in San Diego County, including 76 cases today.
Of San Diego County’s cases, 249 (60%) were men and 166 (40%) were women. Of the known cases, 85 (20%) have required hospitalization, 38 (9%) had to be placed in intensive care and five (1.2%) have died.

Another San Diego resident, a man in his 80s with underlying medical conditions, has died from complications of COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Combined with yesterday’s announcement of a local man in his 20s who died in Riverside County, this brings the total COVID-19 deaths in San Diego County to seven.
“Just these two deaths reflect the sober reality that we are facing, that COVID-19 can affect individuals of all ages,” said Nick Yphantides, County chief medical officer.
County health officials also reported an additional 71 COVID-19 cases in San Diego County, bringing the total to 488.
Of San Diego County’s cases, 280 (57.4%) were men and 206 (42.2%) were women. Of the known cases, 96 (19.7%) have required hospitalization, 42 (8.6%) had to be placed in intensive care and seven (1.4%) have died.
Public Health Order Extended
The County also extended its existing public health order. The order was set to expire on March 31 and has been extended indefinitely. The order mandates the closures of non-essential businesses, including bars, restaurant dining areas, schools, gyms and fitness centers.
Under the order, San Diegans may leave their homes for essential reasons. This includes buying food, picking up medications and exercising. People are being asked to continue practicing social-distancing and keep six feet apart from individuals other than their household members.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that numbers of sick people don’t overwhelm the local health care system and emergency care remains available for non-COVID patients.
The goal is to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for the expected influx of people who become ill.

113,Local COVID-19 Cases Surpass 500,County officials re-emphasized the need for residents to stay at home and practice social distancing as the number of local cases surpassed 500 today.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/local-covid-19-cases-surpass-500/,2020-03-29T19:52:43-07:00,"
County officials re-emphasized the need for residents to stay at home and practice social distancing as the number of local cases surpassed 500 today.
County health officials reported an additional 31 COVID-19 cases in San Diego County, bringing the total to 519.
Of San Diego County’s cases, 298 (57.4%) were men and 219 (42.2%) were women. Of the known cases, 106 (20.4%) have required hospitalization, 47 (9.1%) had to be placed in intensive care and seven (1.3%) have died.
Dr. Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., the medical director of the County’s Epidemiology and Immunization Branch, warned against drawing conclusions about the local outbreak based on day-to-day results.
“It takes a trend of many days to know how the outbreak is going, so fewer cases today compared to the day before does not indicate much,” said McDonald.
He reemphasized following health orders to stay at home and only go out for essential needs, like grocery shopping or taking the dog for a walk.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don’t overwhelm the local health care system. The goal is to “flatten the curve” of COVID-19 – meaning to spread the number of new cases out over time – and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for more sick people.
Food Safety
If a worker at a restaurant or food market tests positive for COVID-19, the business is required by state law to notify the County Department of Environmental Health. County public health officials work with the business to identify contacts of the employee and has persons at risk self-quarantine. A public notification is issued only if there are specific actions members of the public need to take.
Environmental Health is working closely with the food industry during this outbreak. The department has developed materials on food safety practices, good food handler hygiene, and disinfection guidance, using current recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Environmental Protection Agency, and provided them to local restaurants and stores. In addition, this information for restaurant, food and beverage providers is posted online and has been translated into seven languages – English, Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, Tagalog, Farsi and Arabic.
“Since early March, the County’s Department of Environmental Health has been proactive and has worked with food facilities to educate them and help them adhere to the public health orders, such as modifying operations to take out or curbside pick-up,” said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher.
Food facilities should contact the Department of Environmental Heath’s Epidemiology Liaison as soon as possible if they have a situation of an ill food handler (858) 505-6814 or fhdepi@sdcounty.ca.gov.

Health officials today announced the County is restricting the acceptance of cruise ships with COVID-19 cases and has instituted new rules for the unloading of passengers and crew members off cruise ships arriving in San Diego.
The first order, which goes into effect immediately, states:

No passenger or employee may disembark a cruise ship in San Diego harbor without approval of the Health Officer, or designee, if any person on the cruise ship has tested positive for COVID-19.
Any cruise ship that is permitted to dock in San Diego harbor shall notify the Health Officer, or designee, regarding any emergency medical treatment required for a passenger or employee, and shall follow all directives of the Health Officer, or designee.

The second order, which takes effect April 1, 2020, indicates:

No cruise ship in San Diego harbor may dock or disembark employees or passengers after March 31, 2020. However, upon approval of the Health Officer, a cruise ship may dock solely for the purpose of receiving fuel and provisions so long as no employee or passenger disembarks.


Cruise ships docked in San Diego harbor shall notify the Health Officer, or designee, regarding any emergency medical treatment required for a passenger or employee, and shall follow all directives of the Health Officer, or designee.

The second order goes into effect April 1 to allow for the disembarkation of passengers and crew members of the Celebrity Eclipse cruise ship, which began to disembark at the Port of San Diego today and is expected to be done by tomorrow, said Eric McDonald, medical director of the County Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch.
McDonald indicated all passengers and crew members have been medically screened and are healthy, except one who was taken to a local hospital with a heart ailment. Everyone in the ship is going home to self-quarantine for 14 days, including 17 people on the ship who are from San Diego.
Congregate Living Update
At today’s media briefing, County Chief Medical Officer Nick Yphantides updated the County’s work with nursing homes and other congregate living facilities to keep COVID-19 from spreading among these vulnerable populations.
Yphantides said four outbreaks have been reported at congregate living facilities for a combined total of 33 COVID-19 cases and, unfortunately, two deaths. Monitoring and investigations are ongoing.
He also noted it is National Doctors’ Day and thanked doctors, nurses, paramedics and all other health care staff involved in the fight against COVID-19.
“We appreciate you so much,” Yphantides said.
County COVID-19 Cases Reach 603
Through March 30, a total of 603 COVID-19 cases have been reported in San Diego County, including 84 new cases today.
Of San Diego County’s cases, 345 (57%) were men and 256 (43%) were women. Of the known cases, 118 (19%) have required hospitalization, 51 (8%) had to be placed in intensive care and 7 (1.2%) have died.
County officials also talked about other measures and resources to deal with COVID-19. To date:

More than 8,100 San Diegans have been tested.
A total of 2,026 hotel rooms have been secured to isolate people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms and people who are vulnerable and have no place to live.
Of the 1,585 rooms for County Public Health Services use, 112 are occupied, including 109 people who are homeless.
Of the 441 rooms assigned to the Regional Task Force on the Homeless, 170 are being occupied by people who are at higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19. There have been no positive tests among homeless residents of the hotel rooms.
257 handwashing stations have been placed throughout the region and 10 portable bathrooms are being installed today and tomorrow.

Volunteer Opportunities
Many San Diegans have asked where they can volunteer during this time. A website launched through a County partnership lists volunteer opportunities currently available to help with the Covid-19 response, including health care volunteers. Organizations needing volunteers can request their group be posted. Visit JustServe.org/sdcounty.
Social Distancing Flattens Curve
County health officials continue to ask the public to remain at home to avoid contracting the virus and infecting others. If people need to be out to do essential things such as grocery shopping, it’s important that they keep at least six feet apart from other people.
Social distancing has been proven to slow the spread of pandemics so that sick people don’t overwhelm the local health care system.
The goal is to flatten the curve of COVID-19 and lessen the number of people who contract the virus and need hospitalization. Doing so will give the local health care system time to increase its capacity to care for sick people.
How to Stay Mentally and Physically Active
The County has launched a resource site at its Live Well San Diego webpage. Live Well @ Home offers free resources with tips and strategies for people of all ages to stay physically and mentally healthy while staying at home.
The resources and activities are organized by age group and topic to make it easier for people to find the right tools.

A woman in her late 90s is the 16th COVID-19 death reported in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
To prevent the spread of the virus and potential future deaths, San Diegans who are out in public are strongly encouraged to cover their nose and mouth to flatten the curve, County health officials recommended. Businesses, including grocery stores, convenience stores and restaurants, are required to have employees wear face coverings.
The new order and guidance will go into effect at midnight, Friday, April 3.
“We have to take more aggressive measures during the coming weeks to keep people from contracting COVID-19 and to continue flatting the pandemic curve,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We all have an essential role to play and must take these actions to slow and prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
The County is implementing these new guidelines to keep COVID-19 from making more people sick. They include:

Residents are strongly encouraged to cover their nose and mouth when leaving home for essential activities, such as grocery shopping, getting gas, visiting convenience stores or pharmacies.
The cloth facial coverings don’t have to be hospital grade but should cover the nose and mouth. Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don’t need to be used when people are at home.
Effective, Saturday, April 4, all employees of essential businesses must wear a facial covering at supermarkets, grocery stores, gas stations, convenience stores, restaurants and pharmacies.
All public parks and beaches shall close their parking lots.
Law enforcement agencies throughout the region will be out making sure that people who are in public are conducting essential activities and to keep people from being out in groups, especially if they are not members of the same family or household.
People who disobey the essential business guideline or who are in groups in public are subject to a misdemeanor ticket. Penalties can be up to a $1,000 fine or 6 months in jail.

“People should continue to practice physical distancing even when wearing facial coverings,” Wooten said. “They should also wash their hands and take other preventive measures since they can still contract the virus if they touch their eyes, nose or mouth.”

An additional COVID-19 death was reported in San Diego, bringing the region’s total to 17, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
“COVID-19 is in our neighborhoods and communities and, unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths,” said Wilma Wooten, County public health officer, adding that the new death is a man in his late 70s. “People who are not essential workers should remain at home to decrease their chances of contracting the virus and passing it to others, especially people at higher risk of having severe complications from COVID-19.”
County health officials continue to strongly encourage San Diegans to wear a facial covering when out in public conducting essential activities. The cloth facial coverings don’t have to be hospital grade but should cover the nose and mouth. Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable, since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don’t need to be used when people are at home. First 5 San Diego compiled a list of guides for making your own covering.
Guidance for Businesses
Starting April 4, all employees who work in the following businesses must wear facial coverings if they have contact with the public:

Supermarkets and grocery stores
Restaurants
Pharmacies
Convenience stores
Gas stations

Also, all businesses in the region must display their social distancing and sanitation protocol. A template is available on coronavirus-sd.com. The protocol, which should be implemented by April 7, includes:

Signage at each public entrance to inform all employees and customers that they should: avoid entering the facility if they have a cough or fever; maintain a minimum six-foot distance from one another and not shake hands or engage in any unnecessary physical contact.
Display a copy of the Social Distancing Protocol at each public entrance to the facility.
Businesses must make sure every employee who can carry out their work duties from home has been directed to do so. All employees have been told not to come to work, if sick.
All desks or individual workstations are separated by at least six feet.
Break rooms, bathrooms, and other common areas are disinfected frequently.

“All these measures are necessary to protect the health of your employees and everyone around them,” Wooten said. “These aggressive measures are necessary to keep people from contracting COVID-19 and spreading the virus to others.”
COVID-19 Health Order Being Enforced
The County’s health order has also been amended to include the following: boating for recreational purposes, outdoor water sports, swimming and surfing in public waterways or beaches are prohibited.
Law enforcement agencies throughout the region will be out making sure that people who are in public are conducting essential activities and to keep people from being out in groups, especially if they are not members of the same family or household.
They will also be investigating essential businesses that are not following the new facial covering or social distancing guidance. People are encouraged to call their local police department’s non-emergency line or visit 2-1-1 San Diego to report businesses not in compliances.
Residents who disobey the essential business guideline or who are in groups in public are subject to a misdemeanor ticket. Penalties can be up to a $1,000 fine or 6 months in jail.
What Do Cases by ZIP Code Really Mean?
Many people and some media have been questioning what the number of COVID-19 cases by ZIP code really means.
Public health officials say the data does not really indicate much, except where the positive cases reside. It does not show where the person contracted the virus. In some instances, the data also includes the ZIP codes of the hospital where patients were tested, especially if the patients did not have an address.
San Diegans should know that since there is community spread, it is possible to contract COVID-19 in any region, city, or ZIP code of the county.  However, many of the early cases contracted the illness outside of the County.
All residents, regardless of where they live, should follow the guidance that has been given. That includes:

Wearing a facial covering when in public conducting essential activities; for employees of essential businesses who have contact with the public, this is mandatory.
Maintaining physical distance –six feet – from other people.
Washing hands regularly with soap and water or using hand sanitizer.
Staying home, especially if they are sick.
Covering coughs and sneezes.
Not going out in public in groups, especially if you’re not part of the same household.

“You should assume anyone around you could have COVID-19 and take appropriate precautions to avoid contracting the virus,” Wooten said.
COVID-19 Cases Jump to 1,112

County health officials continue to strongly encourage San Diegans to stay at home as much as possible and cover their nose and mouth when out in public conducting essential activities.

Take The Online Pledge
The County today launched a new campaign encouraging San Diegans to take an online pledge and commit to helping stop the spread of COVID-19. The Stay Home, Save Lives pledge asks San Diegans to stay home, use a face covering and physically distance when leaving the house for essential reasons, and pledge to help stop the spread of the virus.
Those signing up for the pledge are encouraged to download one of the campaign’s graphics and share it on their social media accounts with the hashtag #stayhomesd.
Scams Amid Ongoing Crisis
The District Attorney’s office today warned San Diegans about emerging scams amid the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. The DA’s office has investigated more than 240 complaints of price gouging and has served cease and desist notices to two dozen businesses.
District Attorney Summer Stephan shared several tips to help San Diegans avoid scams:

Verify the validity of a charity organization by visiting its official website before making a donation.
Don’t click on links in emails you receive from organizations claiming to be charities. Scammers often use email for phishing scams.
Legitimate government entities will not ask for your personal information over the phone or via email. If you are in doubt about a phone call or email you receive, call the official agency to verify.

The District Attorney’s office has compiled a list of additional resources on its website.

“Thank you to everyone doing their part to help flatten the curve,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Your efforts are helping save lives. Please continue to practice social distancing, avoid groups and gatherings of any size, wash your hands often and stay at home unless you are an essential worker.”
Coping and Mental Health
Outbreaks of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, can be a stressful time for individuals and communities. It is not uncommon to feel anxious or worried while listening, reading or watching the news.
Luke Bergmann, director of County Behavioral Health Services, said it’s important to monitor your own physical and mental health, as well as safely stay connected to your community. Know the signs of stress and when and how to seek help for yourself, as well as loved ones.
“In the face of social distancing, remember that we all need one another – maybe more than ever – to get through difficult times like these. Staying emotionally connected as a community even if we temporarily become more physically isolated is critical to all our mental health,” said Bergmann. “Reach out through technology or phone. Check on one another.”
Behavioral Health Service is offering resources and self-care tools to help manage our mental health and wellbeing.

The number of local COVID-19 deaths remains at 19 and the age range is between 25 and 98 years of age. Fifteen people who have died were men and four were women.
“While we’re happy to see no deaths reported in the past day, it does not mean we won’t see additional COVID-19 fatalities. Deaths are often a lagging indicator,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., medical director of the County Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch. “The most effective way to keep people from getting the virus and to prevent potential deaths is by staying home and wearing a face covering while in public conducting essential activities.”
Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable, since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don’t need to be used when people are at home. First 5 San Diego compiled a list of guides for making your own covering.

Stay Connected to Seniors
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are required to stay physically distant, but this does not mean we can’t be socially connected.
During physical distancing, seniors could feel more isolated than ever. Here’s how you can help:

Check on your elderly neighbors, family and friends.
You can reach out to a handful of neighbors to see if they need anything.
Volunteer to go buy their groceries and supplies.
Show seniors how to use video chat to talk to others using smartphones, laptops or tablets.
Do a phone or text chain which may work better for older adults unfamiliar with video chatting apps.
Write simple messages and leave them at their door or mailbox.

It is important for older adults to remain connected and active. The County’s Live Well at Home webpage we have a link specifically for Seniors and Older Adults which offers our popular “Feeling Fit” videos, which is an exercise program for older adults that you can do at home, even if you have limited mobility. That page will also link you to San Diego Oasis, which offers a “Morning Meditations with Merry” class on Tuesday and Thursday mornings to practice mindfulness and connection.
If you or someone you know is feeling depressed and isolated, please call the County’s Access and Crisis Line at 1-888-724-7240 to speak with an experienced counselor, who can also provide you with a referral to meet your needs and help determine eligibility.
Home-Delivered Meals for Seniors
Low-income adults 60 and older who are homebound due to illness or disability may request to have meals delivered to them if they are registered with a County of San Diego nutrition provider that offers this service.
All eligible seniors who were previously attending a congregate dining site now can pick up a “to-go” meal or request a home-delivered meal to ensure continued access to food. To be connected to this service you can call 1-800-339-4661.
Through additional delivery routes and new volunteer staff, senior nutrition providers have nearly doubled the amount of daily home delivered meals served throughout San Diego.
Thirteen Community Emergency Response Team volunteers from around the County have assisted Feeding San Diego and the San Diego Food Bank with 4 large scale food distribution events. This partnership resulted in over 3,700 families in need receiving food during these events.
For more information about home-delivered meals or nutrition services supported by the County of San Diego, contact the program via email or call 800-339-4661. You can always call 2-1-1 to get connected to resources in your area.

“Reporting of COVID-19 deaths lags behind because people die several days to weeks after they have tested positive and we have to investigate and make sure the deaths are indeed the result of the novel coronavirus,” Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Our deepest condolences go out to the families and friends of all of the victims who have died during this pandemic.”
County health officials continue to encourage San Diegans to stay home to avoid contracting the virus and passing it to others. They are also urging people to wear a facial covering when in public conducting essential activities.
“We all need to do our part to slow the spread of COVID-19 and to help flatten the pandemic curve so that our local health care system is not overwhelmed,” Wooten said. “When you leave your place, cover your face.”

COVID-19 Health Order Being Enforced
Law enforcement agencies throughout the region have been out making sure that people who are in public are conducting essential activities and to keep people from being out in groups, especially if they are not members of the same family or household.
They have issued dozens of tickets to people who refused to disperse after being found in groups in local parks, beaches and parking lots, among other places deemed non-essential.
Law enforcement agencies are investigating essential businesses that are not following the new facial covering or social distancing guidance. People are encouraged to call their local police department’s non-emergency line or visit 2-1-1 San Diego to report businesses not in compliance.
Residents who disobey the essential business guideline or who are in groups in public are subject to a misdemeanor ticket. Penalties can be up to a $1,000 fine, 6 months in jail or both.

Use of Hydroxychloroquine
There are no drugs or therapy that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved for the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. However, on March 30, 2020, the FDA did issue an emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine in certain hospitalized patients.
While this is different than an FDA approval, it is a mechanism for medical providers to consider use of hydroxychloroquine in specific circumstances while they await the results of clinical trials using this drug. The decision to use the drug is up to the family of a patient in consultation with their medical provider.
Hydroxychloroquine is used to prevent or treat malaria, caused by mosquito bites. The medication is also used to treat certain auto-immune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

April 11—Individual Recipient
Penelope JE Quintana
San Diego State University environmental health professor Penelope JE Quintana, Ph.D., M.P.H has been instrumental in bringing attention to air pollution in underserved communities along the US-Mexico border, especially in the community of San Ysidro. With the help of her team of students, Quintana identified the San Ysidro port of entry as a source of the pollution.
A study led by Quintana demonstrated that people waiting in the pedestrian line to cross at the port of entry absorbed carcinogens found in diesel exhaust into their bodies.

Quintana continues to push for air quality measurement and action along the border. Since San Ysidro has no government-operated air quality monitor, Quintana has provided local academic support to the community organization Casa Familiar, to place and maintain a community-led air quality network for San Ysidro. The project uses low-cost air sensors and is recognized as a model for the state of California.
April 10—Theme Recipient
Challenged Athletes Foundation
This year’s National Public Health Week theme – NPHW @: Looking Back. Moving Forward – award recipient is the Challenged Athletes Foundation.
The Foundation began more than 25 years ago when the three founders – Bob Babbitt, Jeffrey Essakow and Rick Kozlowski — organized the San Diego Triathlon Challenge, a fundraiser for their dear friend Jim MacLaren, an amputee who had suffered a second tragic accident that left him a quadriplegic. Their effort launched a global change in the way athletes with physical challenges are perceived and how they perceive themselves.

For 26 years, the Challenged Athletes Foundation has empowered life through sports for a population at-risk due to their chronic and permanent disability. It provides opportunities and support to people with physical challenges so they can pursue active lifestyles through physical fitness.

A heavy week-long storm April 5-10 resulted in flooding and water damage for many homes and businesses. If your property or small business sustained damage from the rain, the County would like your help to estimate rain damages in our region.
The County Office of Emergency Services is asking storm-affected residents to complete a short damage survey form that will assist the County in collecting damage information and associated costs from the rains.
The information gathered from the surveys will be used to estimate total damages countywide and determine if enough damage occurred to qualify the region for disaster assistance, such as low interest disaster loans from the Small Business Administration for those who are uninsured or underinsured.
Completing the form does not guarantee the region or the property owner will be eligible to receive disaster assistance. For additional information, visit sdcountyrecovery.com or email oes@sdcounty.ca.gov.
If your property was damaged by the storm and you need immediate assistance, other local services may be available through www.211sandiego.org.

6 Things to Consider Before Modifying Stay-at-Home Orders
California Gov. Gavin Newsom today announced six indicators the state will use when determining whether to modify the stay-at-home orders, and although he gave no timeline as to when this might occur, he did indicate it would be in phases.
These indicators, which can be modified by local public health officers and will be in place until community immunity is achieved, include having the ability to:

Monitor and protect communities through testing, contact tracing, isolation and supporting people who test positive or have been exposed.
Prevent infection in people who are at risk for more severe COVID-19.
Handle surges in cases by hospitals and health systems.
Develop treatments options to meet the demand.
Support physical distancing by businesses, schools and childcare facilities.
Determine when to reinstitute certain measures, such as the stay-at-home orders, if necessary.

“We will follow the state’s recommendations and guidelines and adapt them as necessary to continue protecting our local residents,” McDonald said. “We understand people want to return to their normal lives, but we must continue to stay at home until the novel coronavirus is no longer a threat to the public.”

The ages of the seven people who died range from 58 to 95 years. Four are men and three are women and all had existing medical conditions.
“Community spread continues to occur in San Diego County and, unfortunately, more COVID-19 deaths are being reported,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The best way to prevent contracting COVID-19 is to stay home and follow all the other public health recommendations.”

County COVID-19 Cases Up by 71
More than 30,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered to San Diegans. Of those, 2,158 have been positive, including 71 new cases announced today.
Of the local cases, 1,081 (50.1%) were men and 1,073 (49.7%) were women. The gender of four people is unknown.

Hospitals report directly to the state the number of patients who are currently hospitalized and in intensive care. The totals can be found here.
County to Reopen in Phases
Public Health Officer Wooten indicated the County will lift portions of the local Health Order in phases and will follow federal and state guidelines, considering the local COVID-19 situation.
Of the federal criteria, some of the metrics are to consider the number of San Diegans with COVID-19 symptoms, the number of cases being reported in the region and the capacity of hospitals to deal with patients needing medical attention.
“We will have to make sure these criteria are satisfied before moving to a phased opening,” said Wooten.
Testing Capacity 
The County will lead a Laboratory Task Force of local hospitals, relevant clinics and commercial laboratory systems responsible for testing to look at increasing COVID-19 testing capacity in the region and, subsequently, expand testing to include additional groups.
Currently, the additional groups that will be a priority for COVID-19 testing include people who are homeless, people in long-term care facilities and other vulnerable populations.
“Testing is very important. We know we can and must test more people,” Wooten said. “We are not there yet but are making tremendous efforts.”

137,72 COVID-19 Deaths Reported Locally; County Could Loosen Restrictions in May,"Seventy-two San Diegans have now died from complications of COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/72-covid-19-deaths-reported-locally-county-could-loosen-restrictions-in-may/,2020-04-20T19:21:15-07:00,"
Seventy-two San Diegans have now died from complications of COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
An additional COVID-19 death –a woman in her mid 80s – was announced today, bringing the region’s total to 72. She had underlying medical conditions.
“Our condolences go out to the family of the latest COVID-19 victim and to all of the loved ones of all the people who have died from this virus,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We must stay the course and people should remain at home to keep the number of COVID-19 deaths and cases from spiking up.”
Sixty-two of the 72 people who have died from COVID-19 were 60 years and older. Of those who have died, 39 were men and 33 were women. Age, gender and ethnic/race breakdowns for cases and deaths are posted at coronavirus-sd.com.
County COVID-19 Cases Reach 2,325
Nearly 34,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in San Diego County. Of those, 2,325 have been positive, including 57 new cases announced today.
Of the local cases, 1,172 (50.4%) were men and 1,149 (49.4%) were women. The gender of four people is unknown. Of the reported cases, 562 (24.2%) have required hospitalization and 189 (8.1%) of the total number of people who tested positive had to be placed in intensive care. Seventy-two (3.1%) have died.
Hospitals report directly to the state the number of patients who are currently hospitalized and in intensive care. The totals can be found here.
County Could Loosen COVID-19 Restrictions by May
County officials also announced COVID-19 restrictions could be loosened in May if metrics continue to move in the right direction.
The County will be considering five federal criteria before lifting some of the restrictions by the local Health Officer Order. The criteria fall within three categories: the number of San Diegans with influenza-like illness and COVID-19 symptoms; the percentage of positive tests compared to number of tests performed; and the capacity of hospitals to deal with all patients and robust testing.
The County also is working with representatives of other local jurisdictions to develop phased public access to parks, beaches and other places.
“County decisions must be based on objective and data-driven information,” Wooten said.

The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to approve a $5 million loan program to help small businesses in the unincorporated area that have suffered losses because of COVID-19. The program will be overseen by the San Diego Foundation.
The loans are intended to allow these businesses to stay afloat and recover quickly once the state’s stay-at-home health order is lifted.
Unincorporated area businesses that employ fewer than 50 people may qualify for the no- or low-interest loans. Applicants could request up to $50,000 and pay no more than 2% interest for a term of up to two years. Businesses that can retain and create jobs will have priority.
The board action allows staff to set up an agreement with the San Diego Foundation to distribute the funds. The Foundation will ensure the loans are covered by the State of California Small Business Loan Guarantee Program or a comparable program.
Loans paid off within 60 months are returned to the County as well as 95% of any defaulted loans.
Applications for the loans could begin as soon as next month.

Hospitals report directly to the state the number of patients who are currently hospitalized and in intensive care. The totals can be found here.
Supervisors Updated On Criteria to Ease Restrictions
County officials gave the County Board of Supervisors an update on the current situation of COVID-19 in the region and shared the criteria that must be met before local restrictions are eased or lifted.
The County will use five federal criteria and state recommendations to determine when and how to ease some of the restrictions in the local Health Officer Order.
The County has met three of the five federal criteria that need to be met before proceeding to a phased opening.
Criteria Met

The County has experienced a 14-day downward trajectory in the number of people with influenza-like illness (ILI) at local emergency departments. From March 16 to April 15, the percentage of ILI in the County dropped from 10% to 3%.
The number of positive COVID-19 cases or positive cases as a percent of the total tests administered had to experience a 14-day downward trajectory. Since April 6, the County has experienced a decreasing percentage in positive COVID-19 tests among San Diegans.
The local health care system has been able to handle the number of patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 and other illnesses and diseases. Currently, local hospitals are operating at 68% of their capacity.

“We will continue monitoring these data to see if this trend holds,” Wooten said.
Criteria in Progress

The County has to register a downward trajectory of COVID-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period. Since April 4, this trend has varied and syndromic indicators for COVID-like cases is being monitored daily.
There also needs to be a robust testing program in place for at-risk health care workers, including emerging antibody testing. The County has organized a Laboratory Task Force of local hospitals, relevant clinics and commercial laboratory systems to expand testing and ensure the safety of testing personnel.

County Microbiologist Jovan Shepherd prepares a specimen for testing of the novel coronavirus.
Regional testing capacity recently has been expanded to about 3,400 tests per day, including rapid testing at the County Public Health Lab and some local hospitals. The list of priority groups for testing also has been expanded to include people who are homeless and people in long-term care facilities. Other groups to be added include people who are HIV positive, low-income individuals, as well as members of various racial groups and Native Americans. 
Reopening in Phases
Planning also is underway for a phased opening of recreation activities that would include parks, trails, beaches, watersports/boating, golf courses, basketball and tennis courts and open spaces, all with certain restrictions in place.
Large gatherings and organized team activities would remain prohibited, other than those involving household units.
The guidance for the general public remains the same. You should:

Stay home unless you’re an essential worker.
Cover your face when in public.
Practice physical distancing and stay six feet apart from other.
Continue practicing good handwashing hygiene.
Stay home if you’re sick and isolate yourself from others. Call your health care provider if your symptoms get worse.

“If you leave your place, cover your face,” Wooten reiterated.
Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten wears a face covering to remind residents one is still recommended when out in public.
COVID-19 Cost to County Government
The County is spending an average of $14 million each month to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 in the region. The funds are being spent on multiple mitigation activities, including:

Surveillance, contact tracing and emergency response.
Ventilators, lab testing and personal protective equipment.
Care and shelter needs for at-risk individuals, including people who are homeless.

It is estimated that the above activities will cost the County $60 million by the end of the current fiscal year, which ends June 30.
The County will be seeking reimbursement from federal and state resources, and will be looking for other funding sources at they become available.

What better way to mark Earth Day than by learning more about the County’s Climate Action Plan and how it works to save the Earth’s natural environment through 26 measures in five areas — the built environment and transportation; energy efficiency; solid waste; water and wastewater; and agriculture and conservation.
Here are some things the County’s Climate Action Plan has done or is doing to protect the Earth:
Built environment and Transportation:

County greenhouse gas reductions have saved enough energy to power 18,112 U.S. homes for a full year.
County has helped install solar panels on 38,510 homes
County has planted 13,390 trees
Proactive ways the County has reduced how often and how far vehicles travel on our roads: purchasing permanent 180 acres in easements from farmers, acquiring conservation land (2,202 acres), encouraging a shift to electric and alternative-fuel vehicles,

Energy Efficiency:

New or remodeled county buildings are designed in concert with USGBC’s LEED requirements
Have upgraded existing buildings to be more efficient
We have increased solar generation at County facilities. Increased onsite renewable energy generation. In 2018, County facilities produced enough electric power to run 515 homes for a year
Parks and recreation facilities have renewable energy systems and electric vehicle charging stations
In 2018, the Ramona library received a Gold LEED certification, and 20 more other LEED certs

Solid Waste/Agriculture and Water

Recycling, reducing and composting has removed 60% of solid waste from landfills
The County is committed to diverting more organic and construction debris from landfills to extend landfill life, reduce transportation costs, avoid methane emissions and improve air quality.
Planning & Development Services has conducted 220 school presentations on recycling and composting, and 6,442 recycling bins supplied to 224 schools, commercial and multi-family facilities
Collecting organic material will improve soil and make working lands more resilient to drought and wildfires
County actions are reducing water use at its own facilities through water-saving designs and through outdoor landscaping requirements for new private development
Organic waste processed into compost can be applied to local farms and gardens to improve soil health, conserve water and reduce the need for synthetic fertilizers.
The County has worked with schools to plant 2,000 trees such as native oak, sycamore, cottonwood and willow. This will help reduce carbon dioxide in our environment.
Rain barrels: They capture water, but also reduce electric use involved in extracting, transporting and treating water.

The number of local COVID-19 deaths went up by four and total cases increased by a record 152, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
One person died April 16 and three died April 21. The ages of the four people who died ranged from 68 to 79 years. Two were men and two were women. All of them had underlying medical conditions.
“It’s very unfortunate that more people have died from COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Our regards and condolences go out to the families of the four deaths announced today and the loved ones of all the people who have lost their lives to this novel virus.”
To date, 100 San Diegans have died from complications of COVID-19. Of the people who have died, 88 were 60 years and older; 56 were men and 44 were women. Age, gender and ethnic/race breakdowns for cases and deaths are posted at coronavirus-sd.com.
County COVID-19 Cases Reach 2,643
Of the nearly 39,000 COVID-19 tests administered to San Diegans, 2,643 have been positive including 152 additional cases announced today, the highest one-day total for the region since 146 cases were announced April 2. Increase in cases are anticipated as the region expands its testing capacity.
Of the local cases, 1,355 (51.3%) were men and 1,284 (48.6%) were women. The gender of four people is unknown. Of the reported cases, 634 (24%) have required hospitalization and 213 (8.1%) of the total number of people who tested positive had to be placed in intensive care. One hundred (3.8%) have died.
COVID-19 Testing in County
Before the County of San Diego can begin to ease some of the local restrictions, there needs to be a robust COVID-19 testing program in place in order to reduce the number of people who get sick and die from the novel virus.
The County has organized a Laboratory Testing Task Force of local hospitals, relevant clinics and commercial laboratory systems to expand testing, while ensuring the safety of testing personnel.
The task force, which will meet three times next week, will be responsible for:

Identifying the COVID-19 testing capacity and capability in the region
Finding gaps and opportunities for increased testing to achieve the region’s capacity
Implementing a countywide serology testing strategy
Implementing quality assurance measures for pop-up testing clinics

“We need to look at the local inventory so that we know exactly what the region’s COVID-19 testing capability is,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This will help us to be able to provide timely and accurate testing to the people at higher risk of developing complications of from this novel virus.”
The regional testing capacity has been expanded to more than 3,400 tests per day. They include:

1,000 plus at the County Public Health Lab
2,000 plus at local hospitals
400 plus private labs

However, some local hospitals have indicated they could ramp up their testing capabilities should it be needed.
But to reach the local COVID-19 testing capacity, local hospitals and clinics need to have the capability and make sure they have enough of the following:

Supplies such as swabs and reagents
Staff to collect samples
Personal protective equipment for staff collecting samples
Couriers and transport methods to get specimens to labs
Enough microbiologists

Doctor’s Referral Required for All Testing
The County is following current federal and state guidelines to determine priority for who should be tested for COVID-19 and has passed along those recommendations to the local medical community.
However, the local health care system has flexibility when deciding who should be tested. Local hospitals can test patients outside the priority groups if they have the capability do it.
“If patients with potential COVID-19 symptoms reach out to their doctor asking to be tested and they are not in the testing priority groups, it is up to doctors to determine if the patient should be tested based on their medical evaluation,” Wooten indicated.
The County is expanding the priority groups of who should be tested for COVID-19.
On-site testing is now available for residents and staff with or without symptoms at congregate facilities such as long-term care places, homeless shelters, treatment centers and correctional facilities. The County will start testing patients at facilities where outbreaks have been reported.
County Microbiologist Jovan Shepherd prepares a specimen for testing of the novel coronavirus.
Also, the list of vulnerable populations has been expanded to include people – with or without symptoms – who are HIV positive, people experiencing homelessness, residents in low-income communities and rural areas, as well as older adults and members of various racial/ethnic groups, including Native Americans.
Starting Monday, County testing sites will be operating in Escondido and Chula Vista and mobile testing sites will soon be in other parts of the region to accommodate the growing demand.
However, everyone being tested needs to have a referral from their doctor. People without one can call 2-1-1 to be connected with a medical provider.
“People need to contact their doctor to get a referral before being tested,” Wooten explained. “You should not show up to a testing location without a doctor’s order.”
Changes to Health Officer Order
Wooten has also made some changes to her Health Officer Order. They include:

Child daycare and childcare providers shall make best efforts to keep children in groups or 10 fewer and keep children in the same group each day. If more than one group of children is cared for at one facility, each group should be in a separate room. Employees shall wear face coverings and should remain solely with one group of children.
Hospitals and health care providers may authorize and perform non-emergency and elective surgeries, or procedures based on clinical need and supply capacity, and where consistent with state guidance.

144,Two Alternate Care Facilities Ready for Patients,"With positive cases of COVID-19 on the rise, the County of San Diego is continuing its preparations for a potential surge of patients requiring hospitalization. The County unveiled an alternate care facility at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido Thursday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/two-alternate-care-facilities-ready-for-patients/,2020-04-24T12:20:18-07:00,"
With positive cases of COVID-19 on the rise, the County of San Diego is continuing its preparations for a potential surge of patients requiring hospitalization. The County unveiled an alternate care facility at Palomar Medical Center in Escondido Thursday.
The 202-bed Federal Medical Station was established with the help of state and federal partners and occupies two formerly vacant floors of the hospital.
“This Federal Medical Station is the latest example of a regional asset that we hope never to use,” said Supervisor Kristin Gaspar, County Board of Supervisors. “Prevention and capacity building are key to this battle and the reopening of San Diego. We may not know exactly what the next few weeks may hold but as a region, San Diego County is prepared.”
The opening of the Federal Medical Station is a prime example of the successful coordination and collaboration between federal, state and local partners in the fight against COVID-19.
The County requested the Federal Medical Station in March as local COVID-19 cases started to increase. The California Department of Public Health processed and approved the project after the Army Corps of Engineers completed a site survey and confirmed the County’s request meets federal criteria.
The new alternate care facility in Escondido is coming online shortly after a similar resource became available at UC San Diego earlier this month. The 350-bed medical facility at the university was created within newly constructed student housing after the university ended in-person instruction due to the spread of the virus in the region.
The two sites will house patients who previously received treatment for COVID-19 at a local hospital and still need to be monitored for symptoms but no longer require a high level of care.
Combined, the two alternate care sites can house 552 patients in case traditional hospitals in the region run out of beds. Right now, hospitals in San Diego have not reached capacity and neither of the two alternate care facilities has been activated.

145,Residents Urged to Take Precautions During Heat,"The National Weather Service has issued a heat advisory until 6 p.m. Saturday. County health officials are encouraging San Diegans to take precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses. People should especially pay close attention to children, the elderly and pets.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/residents-urges-to-take-precautions-during-heat-advisory/,2020-04-24T13:31:40-07:00,"
With high temperatures forecast over the next several days, County health officials are encouraging San Diegans to take precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses. People should especially pay close attention to children, the elderly and pets.
The National Weather Service has issued a heat warning for desert areas, including Borrego Springs, through 6 p.m. Sunday, with temperatures up to 105 degrees. A heat advisory is in effect through 6 p.m. Saturday, with expected highs in the 90s, for San Diego County Valleys including the cities of Escondido, El Cajon, San Marcos, La Mesa, Santee, and Poway.
Due to the Public Health Order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the County will not be operating the Cool Zones program this weekend but are looking at options for next week.
The County has some fans available but is still seeking donations of new fans to distribute to vulnerable individuals and households. If you’re interested in donating, email COVID19-Donations@sdcounty.ca.gov.
To avoid heat-related problems, health officials recommend the following nine strategies:

If available, stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty
Take cool showers
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car
Keep pets cool in hot weather
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun
Avoid using the oven to cook

An extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion, and headache are signs of heatstroke or exhaustion. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature and continue cooling efforts
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

Elderly people (65 years and older), infants and children, and people with chronic medical conditions are more prone to heat stress. People with elderly neighbors should check in on their well-being. This can be done while adhering to social distancing recommendations in person or by phone or video conferencing if available.

“Our sincerest sympathies and condolences go out to the family and friends of the deaths announced today,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We are very sensitive to the tremendous sacrifices being made by the community and I would like to commend the public for staying the course and staying home to decrease the spread of COVID-19.”
To date, 102 San Diegans have died from complications of COVID-19. Of the people who have died, 89 were 60 years and older; 56 were men and 46 were women. Age, gender and ethnic/race breakdowns for cases and deaths are posted at coronavirus-sd.com.
County COVID-19 Cases Reach 2,826
Of the nearly 42,000 COVID-19 tests administered to San Diegans to date, 2,826, or 6.8 percent have been positive. While today’s numbers represent the region’s highest one-day total of positive cases, it is important to note that the County also saw the highest number of tests being administered in one day. A total of 3,122 tests were administered and the 183 positives make up just under 6% of the total tests reported today.
Of the local cases, 1,445 (51.1%) were men and 1,377 (48.7%) were women. The gender of one person is unknown. Of the reported cases, 658 (23.3%) have required hospitalization and 218 (7.7%) of the total number of people who tested positive had to be placed in intensive care. A total of 102 (3.6%) have died.
Changes to Public Health Orders
The County announced it is dialing back restrictions on certain activities that are currently being limited to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Starting Monday, April 27, coastal communities can open beaches and bays for swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddleboarding. If cities open their beaches, walking and running on the sand will continue to be permitted.
Parking lots at beaches will remain closed and sitting or lying on the sand will be prohibited. Group activities like volleyball and other team sports are not permitted and boating is still banned.
Individual coastal cities will oversee beach access in their communities and may impose stricter guidelines than those outlined by the County or choose not to grant beach access.
The County is also taking steps needed to prepare for dialing back restrictions even further. Starting May 1, the County hopes to:

Relax restrictions at parks and golf courses if they can enforce social distancing.
Allow parks to reopen parking lots, with limitations
Allow visitors to sit, lie down and picnic if they practice social distancing.
Allow members of the same family or household to play team sports, including volleyball and basketball.

Beginning next Friday, May 1, all County residents will also be required to cover their face while they are out in public and within six feet of someone that is not a household member.
New COVID-19 Testing Sites
Starting Monday, the County will open two drive-through testing sites, one at the North Inland Live Well Center in Escondido and the other at the Public Health Center in Chula Vista. Mobile testing sites will soon be deployed in other parts of the region to accommodate the growing demand for testing.
Symptomatic people who would like to be tested will need a referral from their doctor. People without a provider or health care coverage can call 2-1-1 and ask to speak to the nurse triage line to request a referral. People with doctor referrals must call 2-1-1 for a screening and an appointment.

147,County’s Two New Testing Sites Open,"Two new, appointment-only COVID-19 testing sites opened today in Escondido and Chula Vista, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-two-new-testing-sites-open/,2020-04-27T10:25:31-07:00,"
Two new, appointment-only COVID-19 testing sites opened today in Escondido and Chula Vista, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
One of the drive-up free testing sites is at the North Inland Live Well Center in Escondido, and the other is at the Live Well Center in Chula Vista.
“The two sites were opened to test people with symptoms to meet the needs of the community,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Our goal is to make testing as widely available as capacity and supplies will allow us.”
Doctor Referral and Appointment Needed
People with symptoms who have a health care provider should contact their doctor to get tested. People with symptoms without a provider or health care coverage can call 2-1-1 and ask to speak to the nurse triage line to request a referral. The nurses can give a referral and make an appointment to get tested.
People without an appointment will not be tested.
Hours of operation at the two sites are as follows:
10 a.m. – 3 p.m.
Monday to Friday
North Inland Live Well Escondido Center
649 W. Mission Ave., Escondido, CA 92025
1 – 7 p.m.
Monday to Friday
Live Well Center at Chula Vista
690 Oxford Street, Chula Vista, CA 91911
Testing capacity will also continue at the County’s first drive-up site at the San Diego County Credit Union Stadium in Mission Valley.
Mobile testing sites will soon be deployed in other parts of the region to accommodate the growing demand for testing.
The nasal swab tests at all three sites are conducted by County Public Health nurses and using the County Public Health lab. Results typically take between 24-48 hours.

148,"County COVID-19 Deaths Up by Two, Cases by 98","Two additional COVID-19 deaths and 98 more cases were reported, bringing the region’s total to 113 and 3,141 respectively, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-covid-19-deaths-up-by-two-cases-by-98/,2020-04-27T19:19:00-07:00,"
Two additional COVID-19 deaths and 98 more cases were reported, bringing the region’s total to 113 and 3,141 respectively, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
A woman in her early 60s died April 23 and a man in his mid-50s died April 25. Both had underlying medical conditions.
“COVID-19 continues to be spread in our communities and, unfortunately, some people are dying,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should continue to stay at home and wear a facial covering when in public to keep the novel virus from spreading.”
Of the people who have died, 98 were 60 years and older; 62 were men and 51 were women. Age, gender and ethnic/race breakdowns for cases and deaths are posted at coronavirus-sd.com.
Positive Tests vs. Tests Administered
One of the federal criteria that the County is closely monitoring before easing or lifting restrictions in the local Health Officer order is the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in comparison to the number of tests administered over a 14-day period.
Since April 13, a total of 19,628 tests have been administered and 1,294, or 6.6%, were positive for COVID-19, including the 98 cases announced today. The goal is for that rolling percentage to trend downward over time.
Total Cases
Of the total local cases to date, 1,601 (51%) were men and 1,537 (48%) were women. The gender of three people is unknown. Of the reported cases, 706 (22.5%) have required hospitalization and 230 (7.3%) of the total cases had to be placed in intensive care. One hundred thirteen (3.6%) have died.
Hospitals report directly to the state the number of patients who are currently hospitalized and in intensive care. The totals can be found here.
Beaches Open with Some Restrictions
The County Monday opened the ocean and bays for swimming, surfing, kayaking and paddleboarding. Some coastal communities have opened their beaches. Walking and running on the sand are permitted.
However, parking lots at beaches remain closed and sitting or lying on the sand is prohibited. Group activities like volleyball and other team sports are not permitted and boating is still banned.
Coastal cities will oversee beach access in their communities and may impose stricter guidelines than those outlined by the County or choose not to grant beach access.
The County is also preparing to dial back other restrictions, starting May 1. They might include:

Relaxing restrictions at parks and beaches if they can enforce social distancing.
Allowing parks and beaches to reopen parking lots, with limitations
Allowing visitors to parks and beaches to sit, lie down and picnic if they practice social distancing.
Allowing members of the same family or household to play team sports, including volleyball and basketball.
Opening golf courses that can follow social distancing protocol.

The County has developed a social distancing and sanitation protocol for parks and beaches.
Also, beginning May 1, all residents will be required to cover their face while in public and within six feet of someone who is not a household member.

The “T3” strategy will address three crucial areas: testing, tracing and treatment.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-rolls-out-testing-tracing-treatment-strategy/,2020-04-28T18:26:53-07:00,"
The County is rolling out a new strategy in its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. The “T3” strategy will address three crucial areas: testing, tracing and treatment.
While treatment options for the novel coronavirus are still being developed, the County’s Health and Human Services Agency is focusing on isolating people with confirmed COVID-19 infections and quarantining their close contacts. HHSA is also working to increase the region’s testing and contact tracing capabilities.
“We continue to expand our team of contact tracers,” said HHSA Director Nick Macchione. “The number of tracers has surpassed 100 and this week, an additional 20 tracers will be added. These are our disease detectives and a critical component of our T3 strategy.”
To assess and increase testing capabilities, the County has organized a Laboratory Testing Task Force of local hospitals, relevant clinics and commercial laboratory systems. Right now, labs in the region can test more than 3,400 specimens per day. The County Task Force has set a goal of testing nearly 5,200 people a day, with that figure based on Harvard research being used by the state and federal government to set COVID-19 testing numbers.
Two-Week Testing Trends
One of the federal criteria that the County is closely monitoring is the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in comparison to the number of tests administered over a 14-day period.
In the past 14 days, a total of 21,254 tests have been administered and 1,384, or 6.5%, were positive for COVID-19. This includes 173 new cases announced today. The goal is for that rolling percentage to trend downward over time.
Data are preliminary and may change.
Cases and Deaths Increase
The number of local COVID-19 deaths went up by five, bringing the region’s total to 118. With the additional 173 positives reported today, there are now a total of 3,314 confirmed COVID-19 infections in the county.
Of the five new deaths reported today, two were women and three were men. One person died April 25, two on April 26 and two on April 27. The ages of the five people who died ranged from 56 to 87 years. All five had underlying medical conditions.
The County also updated the number of outbreaks at nursing homes and other congregate living facilities. There are 42 cumulative active outbreaks, 28 of which are at congregate living facilities and 14 in community settings.
There have been 664 cases and 57 deaths in congregate living facilities and 115 cases and four deaths in community settings.

150,County Meets 4 of 5 Criteria for Reopening,The County is using five federal criteria and state recommendations to determine when and how to ease or lift some of the restrictions in the local Health Officer Order.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-meets-4-of-5-criteria-for-reopening/,2020-04-29T18:39:07-07:00,"
The County is using five federal criteria and state recommendations to determine when and how to ease or lift some of the restrictions in the local Health Officer Order.
The County has met four of the five federal criteria – symptoms, cases and hospitals –and has made progress in the remaining testing criteria.
Four Criteria Met

The County has experienced a 14-day downward trajectory in the number of people with influenza-like illness (ILI) at local emergency departments. From March 16 to April 15, the percent of emergency department visits for ILI dropped from 10% to 3%.
The County must register a downward trajectory of COVID-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period. This trend has varied but has been declining in recent days.
The number of positive cases of COVID-19 in comparison to the number of tests administered over a 14-day period is in a downward trajectory. Since April 6, the County has experienced a decreasing percentage in positive COVID-19 tests among San Diegans.
The local health care system has been able to handle the number of patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 and other illnesses and diseases. Currently, hospital capacity remains stable.

“We have met four of the federal criteria and will continue monitoring to make sure the trends continue,” Wooten said.
Data are preliminary and may change.
Progress Made in Testing 
In order to meet the fifth federal criteria, there also needs to be a robust testing program in place for at-risk health care workers, including emerging antibody testing.
The County and local hospitals have extended their testing capacity and can perform 3,400 tests daily.
While four criteria have been met and significant progress has been made in the remaining fifth metric, the County will await guidance from the state before fully lifting the local stay-at-home order, which the County announced today would be extended indefinitely.
More People Being Tested
Now that regional testing capacity has been expanded to about 3,400 tests per day and includes rapid testing, more people can be tested at local hospitals and County testing sites.
Today, the County released a revised testing process to be able to test more people for COVID-19 and announced that testing will be available in Southeastern San Diego on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., at the Euclid Health Center, 292 Euclid Ave. A doctor’s referral and appointment through 2-1-1 are necessary.
County offering testing for COVID-19 at drive-up sites.
If a person has symptoms or belongs to a specific group, COVID-19 testing is recommended.
If you have a cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, call your medical provider to get tested. If you are experiencing two of the following symptoms – fever,  chills, muscle pain, headache, repeating shaking with chills, or new loss of taste or smell – it is also recommended that you call your doctor to be tested.
If you don’t have a medical provider, you can call 2-1-1 and ask to speak with a public health nurse to get tested at a County drive-through site.
People with or without symptoms, who are part of the following groups should also be tested:

Healthcare workers
First responders
People exposed to confirmed COVID-19 case
People with underlying conditions
Congregate living facility staff and residents
Essential infrastructure occupations
Additional vulnerable groups

People with HIV/AIDS
People in rural areas
Native Americans
Older adults
People experiencing homelessness
Racial/ethnic groups



“These groups represent a large segment of the San Diego County population and we are confident that we will meet our testing goal,” Wooten said. 
COVID-19 Cases, Deaths Up
To date, 120 COVID-19 deaths – 66 men and 54 women – have been reported in San Diego County, including two additional fatalities announced today.
A man in his late 70s and a woman in her mid-80s died April 27. Both had existing medical conditions.
Also, another 118 COVID-19 cases were reported, bringing the region’s total to 3,432.
The County also updated the number of outbreaks at nursing homes and other congregate living facilities.
Currently, there are 43 active outbreaks, 29 of which are at congregate living facilities and 14 in community settings. There have been 700 cases and 63 deaths in congregate living facilities and 129 cases and four deaths in community settings.

151,Protect Yourself and Others – Face Coverings Required in Public,"Beginning May 1, all San Diego County residents will be required to wear cloth face coverings in public when within 6 feet of another person who is not a household contact.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/protect-yourself-and-others-face-coverings-required-in-public/,2020-04-30T17:31:05-07:00,"
Beginning May 1, all San Diego County residents will be required to wear cloth face coverings in public when within 6 feet of another person who is not a household contact.
“When you wear a face covering, you protect those around you,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer, “When others use a face covering, they protect you.”
The cloth facial coverings, which will be required until further notice, don’t have to be hospital grade but should cover the nose and mouth.
Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable, since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don’t need to be used when people are at home.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cloth face coverings should:

Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face
Be secured with ties or ear loops
Include multiple layers of fabric
Allow for breathing without restriction
Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape

Cloth face coverings are an important safety practice for the public to follow to prevent COVID-19 droplet transmission, according to the CDC and the California Department of Public Health.
Residents are still required to stay at home as much as possible, practice social distancing of at least 6 feet, and use other public health measures, such as frequent handwashing, sanitizing protocols and staying home when sick.
Where to Wear Coverings
Face coverings must be worn in public settings, such as:

Waiting in line to go inside a store
Shopping in a store
Picking up food at a restaurant
Waiting for or riding on public transportation
Riding in a taxi or ride service vehicle
Seeking health care
Going into facilities allowed to stay open
Working an essential job that interacts with the public

Face coverings will be required in public until further notice.
Face coverings will not be required:

At home
In the car alone or with members of the same household
When advised by a medical doctor
For children under 2 years old due to the risk of suffocation
When swimming, walking, hiking, bicycling or running provided there is social distancing

“People must have a face covering readily accessible to put on in populated areas to avoid droplet spread in a six feet radius when participating in any type of active recreation,” Wooten said.
Local business must:

Require employees, contractors, owners and volunteers to wear a face covering at work and when working off-site
Inform customers about wearing a face covering, including posting signs and advising those in line or in the store
Refuse service to anyone not wearing a face covering

Will Citations Be Issued? 
The primary goal of the face coverings is for San Diegans to protect each other by following public health orders. It would be unreasonable to expect law enforcement to patrol individual face covering adherence.
However, people who choose not to wear face coverings may be cited and denied access to businesses, transit or recreational areas.

152,"County Eases Park Restrictions, Allows Golf and Boating","The County Thursday revised its Health Officer Order to relax restrictions on parks, golf courses and recreational boating, effective May 1. Cities may have their own parks restrictions, and anyone should check the rules for the specific park before visiting.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-eases-park-restrictions-allows-golf-and-boating/,2020-04-30T18:03:37-07:00,"
The County Thursday revised its Health Officer Order to relax restrictions on parks, golf courses and recreational boating, effective May 1. Cities may have their own parks restrictions, and anyone should check the rules for the specific park before visiting.
Among the revisions:

Parks and their parking lots can reopen with 50% parking capacity.
Members of the same household can sit, picnic, or participate in sports and other activities at parks. Group activities and gatherings are not allowed.
Golf courses can open but must have a physical distancing and safety plan in place and conduct temperature screenings for employees and golfers. Golf carts are not allowed. Anyone with a 100-degree temperature or higher must not be allowed on the premises.

The County is also allowing recreational boating in local lakes, bays and the ocean. If more than one person is in the boat, they need to be members of the same household.
Beaches were allowed to open April 27, but each city will decide whether its beach can open. However, all beach parking lots must remain closed, and no sitting or lying down is allowed at any local beaches.
The revised health order also requires everyone to wear a face covering when in public and within six feet of people not in the same household, or anytime when entering a business. See more details and exceptions.
San Diegans must continue to maintain physical distancing. Handwashing and other preventive measures are still recommended.
“As San Diego County residents, you have done a great job over the past six weeks,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer, after explaining that the County is easing some of the restrictions because the region has met four of the five federal criteria and state recommendations for reopening.
“If we see a trend going in the wrong direction because people are not following the recommended guidelines, we can dial back the Health Officer Order,” Wooten said, adding that her order has been extended until further notice and to align with the state.
4 New COVID-19 Deaths and 132 Cases Reported
Four more COVID-19 deaths have been reported bringing the region’s total to 124. Four men died – one on April 27 and three on April 28. Their ages range from 55 to 88 years. Three had underlying medical conditions and the 55-year-old did not.
The total COVID-19 cases in San Diego County increased to 3,564 after an additional 132 cases were reported yesterday.
The number of outbreaks, deaths and cases at nursing homes and other congregate living facilities are:

47 active outbreaks; 31 at congregate living facilities and 16 in community settings
64 deaths and 725 cases in congregate living facilities

154,County to Expand Testing and Tracing Staff,The County’s Health and Human Services Agency will hire or retrain more than 500 staff to conduct COVID-19 testing and tracing as part of its efforts to fight the virus.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-expand-testing-and-tracing-staff/,2020-05-01T18:27:18-07:00,"
The County’s Health and Human Services Agency will hire or retrain more than 500 staff to conduct COVID-19 testing and tracing as part of its efforts to fight the virus. The testing focus will be on at-risk populations, including residents in senior living facilities and low-income communities.
“Our commitment at the County is to keep a sharp focus on the priority populations, the vulnerable and underserved people that (Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer) has identified in her recent testing guidance,” said HHSA Director Nick Macchione. “This will require us to get a little more creative in taking the testing to the places where it is needed most.”
In an effort to meet the region’s testing goals, the County will deploy several mobile testing sites to at-risk communities. In addition to the new Live Well Bus, the County Library’s bookmobiles and other County vehicles will also be used as mobile testing sites soon.
New Testing and Tracing Staff
The County currently has a staff of more than 120 case and contact tracers who have conducted more than 4,000 COVID-19 investigations since the beginning of the public health crisis. Each confirmed positive case generates an average of three contact investigations.
The County is proposing to expand the number of contact tracers to 450 in the coming months. This pool of tracers will be made up of current County employees and external applicants. The County today posted an opening for temporary contact tracers.
The County also plans to hire an additional 200 public health nurses to help support the area’s testing efforts. The region’s Laboratory Task Force has set a goal of testing 5,200 people a day, with that figure based on Harvard research being used by the federal and state government to set COVID-19 testing numbers.
Face Coverings Mandatory 
As of today, all San Diego County residents are required to wear cloth face coverings in public when within 6 feet of another person who is not a household member, or whenever entering a store or other business. The cloth facial coverings, which will be required until further notice, don’t have to be hospital grade, but should cover the nose and mouth.
While local law enforcement agencies will focus on education about the new public health orders about face coverings, the County is providing 10,000 face coverings to local law enforcement entities so officers can distribute them to the public when they contact individuals.
10 New COVID-19 Deaths and 147 New Cases Reported
Ten more COVID-19 deaths have been reported bringing the region’s total to 134. Of those who died, seven were men and three were women. Their ages range from 52 to 92 years. The ten individuals died between April 18 and 30.
The total COVID-19 cases in the County increased to 3,711 cases, which is 147 more cases than were reported yesterday.
The number of outbreaks, deaths and cases at nursing homes and other congregate living facilities are:

54 active outbreaks; 36 at congregate living facilities and 18 in community settings
64 deaths and 882 cases in congregate living facilities
5 deaths and 149 cases in community settings

A doctor’s referral is not required for testing at the above sites, but appointments are required. Appointments can be made online at https://lhi.care/covidtesting, which is currently compatible with desktop computers and Android devices. Compatibility with Apple devices is coming soon. If you have no Internet access, call 888-634-1123, Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.
The County will continue to offer appointment-only COVID-19 testing at the San Diego County Credit Union Stadium and the Live Well Center at Chula Vista.
The new Live Well Mobile Office, which began providing testing in Southeastern San Diego last Saturday, will continue to be deployed for testing throughout the region, as well as the County Library’s bookmobiles and other County vehicles. A doctor’s referral and an appointment through 2-1-1 are required for testing at County sites.
The County also plans to hire an additional 200 public health nurses to help support the area’s testing efforts.
Reopening plans
With more testing and tracing being done, the County is further prepared to loosen more of the local restrictions and allow businesses considered low-risk to reopen, which according to the state could occur by the end of this week.
At its meeting tomorrow, the County Board of Supervisors will consider a Business Safety Framework, a general outline for local businesses highlighting the things they need to prepare for and do before they could reopen. It includes steps to cover customer safety, employee safety, sanitation practices, physical distancing and general business practices.
Tracing of COVID-19
The County is in the process of expanding the number of local contact tracers to about 450 in the coming months. The pool of tracers will be made up of current County employees and external applicants, who will be trained to do COVID-19 investigations.
Currently, the County has more than 130 case and contact investigators who have conducted nearly 5,000 COVID-19 investigations since monitoring for the novel virus began in the region.
Face Coverings Required in Public
County health officials continue encourage San Diegans to wear a face covering when in public to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19.
“When you wear a face covering, whether you have symptoms or not, you’re less likely transmit the virus to others. And others are less likely to spread it to you,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer. “The face coverings protect you, but especially those around you.”
People are not required to wear the face covering all the time, but anytime you come within six feet of people who are not a household contact, or when entering a business. You can carry the mask with you and put it on when approaching others, Wooten added. See more details and exceptions.
Face coverings are now required when in public.

156,County Approves Framework for Some Businesses to Reopen,"Starting Friday, some local businesses can begin to reopen if they have a plan in place to protect their employees and the public.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-approves-framework-for-some-businesses-to-reopen/,2020-05-05T18:12:32-07:00,"
Starting Friday, some local businesses can begin to reopen if they have a plan in place to protect their employees and the public.
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors today voted to adopt the Business Safety Framework, a general outline for local businesses highlighting the things they need to prepare for and do before they could reopen. The supervisors also requested that the County’s chief administrative officer ask Gov. Gavin Newsom to provide the County with the autonomy to make region-related, COVID-19 decisions.
The goal of the framework is for businesses to be ready to reopen when authorized by the governor, who is expected to announce guidance on May 7.
But before businesses can reopen, they need to create a Safe Reopening Plan. A template is available now to review, but may be updated depending on direction from the state. Businesses will need to complete, print and post the plan at their entrance.
They also must ensure proper sanitation, physical distancing and general business practices and communication.
The governor announced that retail and manufacturing businesses with curbside pick-up will be allowed to reopen because they represent a lower risk of spreading COVID-19. Among them:

Bookstores
Clothing stores
Toy stores
Florists
Sporting goods

Social Distancing Saves Lives
The supervisors also received an update on the County’s efforts to mitigate the impact that COVID-19 is having in the region.
They heard from Dr. Natasha Martin, associate professor in the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the UC San Diego. Martin’s simulation models help to explain disease epidemics and to predict the impact of prevention interventions.
Her modeling looked at the rate of infection of COVID-19 in the region, as well as the number of deaths that were potentially prevented by implementing physical distancing.
Martin explained that with social distancing, one infected person would transmit COVID-19 to another, and that person, in turn, would infect a third individual and so on.
Without physical distancing, an infected person would have exposed four others and each of those four people would infect four more.
According to Martin, because of physical distancing, a lot fewer San Diegans have been infected with COVID-19 or, more importantly, have died.
Without social distancing, Martin’s model indicated that more than 13,000 San Diegans could have died by now. But because people were required to stay home and keep their distance from others, the lives of about 6,000 to 18,000 San Diegan lives have been saved.
Phased Reopening
County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten went over the federal criteria the County have met so that it can move forward and ease even more of the local restrictions in her health officer order.
The County has met four of the five federal criteria for reopening:

The County has experienced a 14-day downward trajectory in the number of people with influenza-like illness at local emergency departments.
The County has registered a downward trajectory of COVID-like syndromic cases reported within a 14-day period.
The number of positive cases of COVID-19 in comparison to the number of tests administered over a 14-day period has been in a downward trajectory.
The local health care system has been able to handle the number of patients needing hospitalization for COVID-19 and other illnesses and diseases.

The fifth criteria involves COVID-19 testing, an area where the County is making daily progress.
“We are beginning to ease the local public health order and will be following state guidance so that we can move from stage one to state two,” said Wooten, adding that the guidance for the public remains the same.
People should continue to stay at home, wear a face covering when in public, stay six feet away from other people and take other preventive measures, such as washing their hands and staying home when sick.
COVID-19 Testing and Tracing
County Health and Human Services Agency Director Nick Macchione, who is spearheading the region’s T3: Test, Trace and Treat strategy, told the Board COVID-19 testing is more widely available in the region.
Testing is available at local hospitals, medical groups, some community clinics and private labs. The state has also opened three testing sites –Escondido, El Cajon and Chula Vista – that are offering free testing by appointment. If you have no Internet access, call 888-634-1123, Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to get tested.
More COVID-19 testing now offered in San Diego County.
The County continues to offer appointment-only COVID-19 testing at the San Diego County Credit Union Stadium and the Live Well Center at Chula Vista.

157,Stay Home and Stay Cool During Heat Warning,Residents are reminded to avoid activities that may cause overheating due to high temperatures this week in San Diego’s valleys and deserts.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/stay-home-and-stay-cool-during-heat-warning/,2020-05-06T16:10:09-07:00,"
Residents are reminded to avoid activities that may cause overheating due to high temperatures this week in San Diego’s valleys and deserts.
“With hot weather comes huge risks for many San Diegans, especially our seniors and the disabled,” said Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who represents much of East County. “In light of the current stay-at-home orders, it’s critical that we are in contact with family, friends and neighbors and make sure they are doing all they can to stay cool.”
The National Weather Service issued the heat advisory for county valleys including the cities of Escondido, El Cajon, San Marcos, Santee, and Poway. Temperatures will be in the 90s with a peak of 95 to 100 on Wednesday and Thursday. Forecasters also issued an excessive heat warning for the San Diego County deserts where temperatures are expected to reach 103 to 108 degrees in the afternoons.
During this hot weather, seniors can stay home and stay cool. Even with some Cool Zone sites opening at the end of May, not all seniors or persons with disabilities can leave home to escape the heat.  Homebound individuals, those lacking transportation, and those who decide to stay home due to the risk of COVID-19, may not be able to take advantage of traditional Cool Zone sites.
To help these community members beat the heat, the County of San Diego, in partnership with SDG&E, provides free electric fans to those who are living on limited incomes. To be eligible, a resident must not have access to an air-conditioned space at their home or apartment building. To learn more about the fan program or to request a fan, call Aging & Independence Services at (800) 339-4661.
“We want to thank our SDG&E community partner for making this program available to give some relief from the heat to our more vulnerable residents,” said County Supervisor Jim Desmond, whose district covers parts of North County out to the desert.
Health officials recommend people do the following to avoid overheating

If available, stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty
Take cool showers
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car
Keep pets cool in hot weather
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun
Avoid using the oven to cook

An extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion, and headache are signs of heatstroke or exhaustion. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature and continue cooling efforts
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

Older adults (65 years and older), infants and children, and people with chronic medical conditions are more prone to heat stress. People with elderly neighbors should check in on their well-being. This can be done while adhering to social distancing recommendations in person or by phone or video conferencing if available.
For more information on extreme heat, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For more information on the Cool Zones program as well as tips to stay cool at home, visit www.coolzones.org.

158,No Customers Inside When Businesses Reopen,"As more San Diego County businesses prepare to reopen, it is important to remember that only curbside pick-up will be allowed, and no customers should be inside the premises.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/no-customers-inside-when-businesses-reopen/,2020-05-06T17:34:43-07:00,"
As more San Diego County businesses prepare to reopen, it is important to remember that only curbside pick-up will be allowed, and no customers should be inside the premises.
Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to announce modifications to his order later this week and allow more businesses to safely open.
But before businesses can reopen, they need to create a Safe Reopening Plan, which ensures the safety of employees and customers. A template is available now that businesses will need to complete, print and post the plan at their entrance. The plan, which also ensures proper sanitation, physical distancing and general business practices, may need to be updated, and displayed again, depending on direction from the state.
The governor announced that retail and manufacturing businesses with curbside pick-up will be allowed to reopen because they represent a lower risk of spreading COVID-19. Among them:

Bookstores
Clothing stores
Toy stores
Florists
Sporting goods

The County recognizes that business owners and the public are anxious for more businesses to reopen, but their reopening is aligned with the easing of the governor’s order and must be done safely.
When they open their doors, businesses must ensure that social distancing and the face covering guidelines are being followed to prevent or slow the spread of the virus.
County health officials believe San Diegans will continue to do the right thing.
“We have confidence in our residents and businesses,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Everyone has done a great job and that is why numbers are trending in the right direction.”
COVID-19 Testing 
COVID-19 testing is more widely available in the region. It is available at local hospitals, medical groups, some community clinics and private labs.
The state has also opened three testing sites – in Escondido, El Cajon and Chula Vista – that are offering free testing by appointment. If you have no Internet access, call 888-634-1123, Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. to get tested.
While appointments at the state sites have been filled for this week, San Diegans are encouraged to regularly visit the site to register for a spot for next week.
The new Live Well Mobile Office, as well as the County Library’s bookmobiles and other County vehicles will be deployed for testing throughout the region. A doctor’s referral is requested for appointments through 2-1-1 testing at County sites, although nurses handling the calls can connect individuals without a doctor to a medical provider.
COVID-19 Testing, Cases and Deaths

159,More San Diego County Businesses Can Reopen,"With the easing of more restrictions in the statewide stay-at-home order, retail and related manufacturing businesses in San Diego County can begin opening tomorrow, but only for delivery or curbside pickup.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/more-san-diego-county-businesses-can-reopen/,2020-05-07T17:33:04-07:00,"
With the easing of more restrictions in the statewide stay-at-home order, retail and related manufacturing businesses in San Diego County can begin opening tomorrow, but only for delivery or curbside pickup.
Retail and manufacturing businesses are being allowed to reopen because they represent a lower risk of spreading COVID-19. They include shops that sell books, shoes, clothing, music, jewelry and sporting goods among others.
When businesses open their doors, they must do it safely. They are not allowed to have customers inside and must prepare and post a Safe Reopening Plan to ensure the safety of employees and the public.
The plan also ensures proper sanitation, physical distancing and general business practices. Businesses should also review and refer to the state checklist for their specific industry, such as the Retailer guidance and checklist, when completing the County plan.
“Businesses should make sure that the social distancing and face covering guidelines are being followed,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “These guidelines remain in place to protect San Diegans from getting and spreading the virus.”
Business owners needing clarification of the reopening guidelines can email questions to: COVID19BusinessQuestions@sdcounty.ca.gov.
The state announced new guidelines that would allow some counties to reopen at a faster rate. However, no large jurisdictions in California is expected to meet the new metrics, which include no COVID-19 deaths over a 14-day period. As a result, San Diego County’s reopening is expected to stay consistent with state guidance.
COVID-19 Testing in San Diego
The County’s Live Well Mobile Office will be offering COVID-19 testing in Southeastern San Diego on Saturday from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Euclid Health Center, 292 Euclid Ave. An appointment through 2-1-1 is necessary, and slots will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.
COVID-19 testing remains available at local hospitals, medical groups, some community clinics and private labs.
The state also has three testing sites – in Escondido, El Cajon and Chula Vista – that are offering free testing by appointment Monday through Friday. You can schedule an appointment online or by calling (888) 634-1123.
Planning also is underway to deploy the County Library’s bookmobiles and other County vehicles for testing throughout the region.

160,Two County Children Win Virtual Earth Day Art Contest,Samarth Joshi of San Diego and Yoshie Sannwald of El Cajon have been named winners of the County Land Use and Environment Group's Earth Day 2020 drawing and animation contests for their artistic expressions of how to save and love the Earth.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/two-children-win-virtual-earth-day-art-contest/,2020-05-08T11:35:34-07:00,"
Two San Diego County children have been named winners of the County Land Use and Environment Group’s Earth Day 2020 drawing and animation contests for their artistic expressions of how to save and love the Earth.
Samarth Joshi, 4, of San Diego, and Yoshie Sannwald, 10, of El Cajon won the contests that were part of the Land Use and Environment Group’s first “virtual” Earth Day 2020 celebration.
Their winning artwork is displayed for the public to see on the Virtual Earth Day 2020’s contest page.
Samarth, who turns 5 years old May 12, won for his cool drawing of a blue-and-green Earth with messages of “Save Trees,” “Save Water,” “Save Earth.”
Yoshie won the animation contest for her awesome, animated computer GIF that shows a smiling, spinning Earth against a backdrop of her hands flashing the sign language letters for “Love the Earth.”
Contestants in the drawing category, which was open to children aged 10 and younger, were asked to submit an original picture or drawing illustrating “what Earth Day means to you.” The animation contest was open to children and teens between the ages of 10 and 18 years old and contestants were challenged to animate their vision of Earth Day with a GIF.
Samarth’s mother said he was excited about winning and hasn’t stopped talking about the seasons, the rains and the environment since. She said Samarth loves arts and crafts, reading, Legos and cooking as well.
Yoshie was also excited to hear she won. Her mother said Yoshie loves to participate in group and social activities, things that have been hard to do during the COVID 19 pandemic — the event that inspired the County’s “Virtual Earth Day 2020” website. She said Yoshie loves to do all kinds of art, anything that lets her be creative and to express herself, including painting, drawing, crafts and fashion.
Asked about Yoshie’s creative use of sign language in her GIF, her mother said Yoshie only knows a few basic American Sign Language signs,  but was inspired to use them in her artwork because she loves languages (she’s been taking Spanish since kindergarten).
The Land Use and Environment Group created an entire virtual Earth Day Celebration to give children, teens, adults and families a fun way to enjoy Earth Day even though beaches, parks and trails had been closed by the COVID 19 pandemic.
The Virtual Earth Day 2020 website included links to with games, virtual travel to exotic places around the world, videos of San Diego County Supervisors talking about what Earth Day means to them, the County’s Earth Day Pledge, and information about the County’s Climate Action Plan and what people can do to protect our air and water.

161,"Restrictions Eased on Camping, Recreation Rentals","The County today revised its Health Officer Order, further relaxing restrictions on recreational activities, including camping and the rentals of certain recreational equipment.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/restrictions-eased-on-camping-recreation-rentals/,2020-05-08T18:40:01-07:00,"
The County today revised its Health Officer Order, further relaxing restrictions on recreational activities, including camping and the rentals of certain recreational equipment.
Effective May 9, local campgrounds can begin to reopen, but certain restrictions will apply. Campgrounds will have to operate at 50% of their regular capacity and occupants of individual campsites must be members of the same household.
Playgrounds and other campground amenities will not be available at this time. Local jurisdictions within the county may have their own camping restrictions, and residents should check the rules for the specific campsite before visiting.
In addition, businesses that rent recreational equipment, including bicycles, surfboards, boats, kayaks and other watercraft can reopen if, like other businesses allowed to reopen, they prepare a Safe Reopening Plan.
Groups renting equipment that can be used by multiple people have to be members of the same household. Rental facilities are required to sanitize all equipment with a disinfectant effective against the novel coronavirus after each use.
Also under the revised orders, childcare facilities can increase the number of children from 10 to 12 children per group. Employees at childcare facilities are no longer required to wear face coverings.
While certain restrictions are being lifted, County officials are reminding residents that gatherings of any size are still banned.
“People should stay at home as much as possible and not mingle with individuals who are not part of their own household,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Gathering restrictions remain in place to protect San Diegans from getting and spreading the virus.”
Additional Safety Measures for Essential Businesses
The revised health order also requires essential businesses that have been operating during the public health crisis to implement additional safety measures. They will be required to take the temperature of employees and not allow anyone with a temperature of 100 degrees or more into the workplace. If a thermometer is not available, businesses can screen for symptoms and should not allow in any employees who have a cough, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, or two or more of the following: fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat or new loss of taste or smell.
COVID-19 Testing, Cases and Deaths

162,Tips to Maintain Your Mental Health During COVID-19,May is Mental Health Month and County officials are encouraging you to monitor your mental wellbeing and that of your loved ones. They’re also offering tips on how to mentally cope with pandemics.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/tips-to-maintain-your-mental-health-during-covid-19/,2020-05-11T16:00:18-07:00,"
Outbreaks of infectious diseases can be a stressful time. With additional concerns about the economic impact of the pandemic, many may feel overwhelmed with anxiety, fear, or worry.
May is Mental Health Month and County officials are encouraging you to monitor your mental well-being and that of your loved ones. They’re also offering tips on how to mentally cope with pandemics.
Common signs of distress may include:

Feelings of numbness, disbelief, anxiety, or fear
Changes in appetite, energy, and activity levels
Difficulty concentrating
Difficulty sleeping or nightmares and upsetting thoughts and images
Physical reactions, such as headaches, body pains, stomach problems, and skin rashes
Worsening of chronic health problems
Anger or short temper

Luke Bergmann, director of County Behavioral Health Services, said it’s important to keenly observe your mental and emotional wellbeing and to find ways to safely stay connected to your friends and family. Be aware of the signs of stress and know when to seek help for yourself, and those you care about.
“While COVID-19 is impacting communities in different ways and to different extents, it is traumatic for all of us.  We all need one another, now maybe more than ever, to get through difficult times,” Bergmann said. “Find ways to stay connected. Call or video chat with friends and family or a support line until it’s safe to do it in person.”
Here are other tips to maintain your mental health:

Take care of your body by stretching, taking deep breaths, and meditating.
Eat healthy and well-balanced meals.
Exercise and get plenty of sleep.
Make time to unwind and engage in activities you love, if they’re allowed.
Limit time spent watching, reading or listening to information about the pandemic, even on social media.

Mental Health Resources Available Year Round
Mental Health Month was established to raise awareness, educate communities and reduce stigma surrounding people experiencing mental illness.
The County Administration Center, located at 1600 Pacific Highway, will be lit lime green from May 11-15 to celebrate people in recovery and those who support them.
The County and its partners have created virtual events to commemorate the month, due to the restrictions on public gatherings. People can still come together to break the stigma and support mental health.
It’s important for residents to know that despite the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health resources and support are still readily available through County Behavioral Health Services and its many service providers.
If you or someone you know need help or are experiencing a mental health crisis, you can talk to a trained counselor by calling the County’s 24-hour, multi-lingual Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240. Other resources are available on Behavioral Health Services’ COVID-19 Resources for Families, Parents & Caregivers webpage or the It’s Up to Us website.

The number of daily total tests in the region exceeded 3,300 in four of the past five days. Yesterday, there was a decrease in the number of tests reported – 2,638 tests. Testing dips typically occur on Sundays. The decrease may be more pronounced with the three state sites, which have a capacity of nearly 800 daily tests, being closed on Sundays and Mondays.
Overall, the number of tests is expected to continue to climb toward the goal of 5,200 in the region daily. The County remains on the right trajectory with testing and contact tracing and should be ready to continue reopening the local economy when the state moves to lift more restrictions.
County officials said they are following guidance from the state and will continue to reopen the local economy in a way that protects public health and allows for a sustained recovery.

COVID-19 testing is also available at local hospitals, medical groups, some community clinics and private labs.
The state’s three testing sites – currently in Escondido, El Cajon and Chula Vista –are offering free testing by appointment Tuesday through Saturday. You can schedule an appointment online or by calling (888) 634-1123.
The County’s Live Well Mobile Office has provided local testing in Southeastern San Diego. The County Library’s bookmobiles and other County vehicles will be deployed to offer testing throughout the region, especially where hot spots of the novel virus are detected.
Face Coverings Mandatory in Public 
Local health officials reiterated the importance of wearing a facial covering when in public, especially when within six feet or less of someone who is not a member of the same household.
“We encourage people who are not wearing a face covering in public to do so,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The face coverings help to protect the public and prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
To make sure everyone has access to a face covering, local law enforcement agencies and the Metropolitan Transit System have been distributing some to the public.

Most San Diegans have followed the recommendations in the Health Officer Order, allowing for the local economy to steadily reopen in sync with the state.
While some businesses have been allowed to reopen and recreational activities are occurring with some restrictions, there is one rule that remains in place: gatherings are still prohibited.
“Stage Two does not allow gatherings,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If people get together and they are not members of the same household, they are putting people at risk.”
County officials continue to ask San Diegans to be patient and to follow the local health officer recommendations to prevent the spread COVID-19.
By continuing to practice physical distancing and using face coverings in public, San Diegans will greatly contribute to the continued reopening of the region’s economy.

No open bathrooms
No spectators
No people in the vehicle who are not part of the same household

166,“Great Plates Delivered” to Send Free Meals to Seniors,"Qualified older adults in the region can now sign up to get three free and healthy meals a day delivered to their home for a limited time through the “Great Plates Delivered” program, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/great-plates-delivered-to-send-free-meals-to-seniors/,2020-05-14T14:39:12-07:00,"
Qualified older adults in the region can now sign up to get three free and healthy meals a day delivered to their home for a limited time through the “Great Plates Delivered” program, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The initiative is a collaboration between the County and local restaurants. The goal of the program is to help older adults, who are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19, avoid going out to restaurants or the grocery store to get food. The meal delivery is scheduled to run through June 10, though it may be extended.
“Older adults are vital members of our community,” said Kimberly Gallo, Aging & Independence Services director. “The Great Plates Delivered program is an excellent example of how government and businesses can innovate and work together to meet the needs of older adults during these difficult times.”
In addition to assisting older County residents, the program will help local restaurants stay afloat amid the statewide stay-at-home orders. The County will reimburse restaurants for the cost of food, labor and incidentals, using a combination of funding provided by FEMA, the State and the County.
Food providers were selected by a County committee based on several factors, including their ability to meet volume and nutritional standards, source local produce and meats, as well as prioritizing local jobs and worker retention.
The program is open to county residents who meet the following criteria:

People 65 and older who live alone or with one other older adult
County residents 60-64 who are high-risk as defined by the CDC, including:

People who tested positive for COVID-19
People with an underlying medical condition that puts them at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19
People who have been exposed to COVID-19 and do not require hospitalization, but are required to self-isolate or self-quarantine



Those currently receiving assistance from other state or federal nutrition assistance programs, such as CalFresh or Meals on Wheels, are not eligible for the Great Plates Delivered program. Participants must also fall within a specific income range.
For more details or to sign up, call the AIS Call Center at (800) 339-4661 or visit www.aging.sandiegocounty.gov/greatplates. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego.

167,Percentage of Positive COVID-19 Among Tested Continuing Down,"Nearly 4,000 COVID-19 tests were reported May 13, the highest daily total since testing began to be conducted in the region.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/percentage-of-positive-covid-19-among-tested-continuing-down/,2020-05-14T17:51:51-07:00,"
Nearly 4,000 COVID-19 tests were reported May 13, the highest daily total since testing began to be conducted in the region.
At the same time, the percentage of positive COVID-19 cases has been going down, a sign that the region is moving in the right direction in containing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The number of positive cases in comparison to the number of tests administered daily is important because that is one of the federal metrics the County is using to determine when to further ease restrictions in the local Health Officer Order.
The 14-day, rolling percentage has been trending downward and has decreased from 6.2% to 4.6% over the past two weeks.

“San Diegans have been following the guidance we’ve provided and this has helped to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If this downward trajectory continues, we’ll be able to move forward with additional reopening steps and give people a greater sense of normalcy.”
County health officials expect that as more local residents are being tested for COVID-19 – the goal is to test about 5,200 people daily – the percentage of positive cases will go down because testing now includes a wider sampling and not just people exhibiting symptoms who are more likely to be infected with the virus.
In light of the trends, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday will discuss asking the state to let the County develop a plan to accelerate the reopening local businesses in a safe manner. The goal is for the County to submit alternative data that supports a faster reopening that protects both workers and the public.
Some County Libraries to Provide Door-side Service
Employees from some County departments will return to work from their respective offices starting May 15, although most people who have been working at home or remotely will initially continue to do it.
Starting May 26, some County libraries will be providing door-side service to residents. People can reserve library materials through the County Library online catalog. Library staff will contact patrons to schedule a pick-up date. Beginning June 6, six more libraries will be providing the same service. You can find the list of branches on the Library website.
Free Food Delivery Program
The County also launched Great Plates Delivered, a program that connects qualified older adults in the region with local restaurants to receive three free and healthy meals a day, delivered to their home.
Where to Get Tested for COVID-19
COVID-19 testing is available through your medical provider, at local hospitals, some community clinics and private labs. If you don’t have a medical provider, call 2-1-1 and they’ll connect you to one.
The County’s Live Well Mobile Office will be in Southeastern San Diego from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sat., May 16 at the Euclid Health Center, located at 292 Euclid Ave. An appointment is required and can be set up by calling 2-1-1 and asking to speak to a public health nurse.

171,Shape San Diego County’s Future – Serve on Redistricting Commission,The opportunity only comes once every 10 years – a chance to redraw the boundaries of the County’s five supervisorial districts.  ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/shape-san-diego-countys-future-serve-on-redistricting-commission/,2020-05-18T08:33:46-07:00,"
The opportunity only comes once every 10 years – a chance to redraw the boundaries of the County’s five supervisorial districts.
The County is taking applications now for people who can serve on its Independent Redistricting Commission. Members will redraw the district lines to reflect the new numbers in the federal census.
Why is that important? District lines can shape a community’s ability to elect the representative of their choice.

The 2020 census numbers will reveal new data on residents and whether one district is more populated than the others. Each supervisor should represent a diverse population of about 650,000 residents.
Redistricting Commission members will re-shape the district boundaries to meet community needs. The commission will act independently from the Board of Supervisors.
The County’s Clerk of the Board will take Redistricting Commission applications through July 31.
To qualify, volunteers must be San Diego County residents who were registered to vote with the same political party or listed as no party preference for the last five years. And they must have voted in at least one of the last three statewide elections. Applicants must not have been active in political circles for the last 10 years. They must be impartial and demonstrate analytical skills.
Applications will be screened for the 60 most qualified applicants. One commissioner for each of the five districts will be picked during a random drawing at the Oct. 13 Board of Supervisors meeting. A second random drawing that day will select three additional commissioners for a total of eight.
Those commissioners will meet to decide on six more to round out a 14-member commission.
Once formed, the Redistricting Commission must hold at least seven public hearings in 30 days with at least one hearing in each supervisorial district. Other meetings, dates and times are at the discretion of the commission.
The group will review the new census data when it’s released and start the process on redrawing new maps for the five supervisorial districts. The maps must be completed by Aug. 15, 2021.

County health officials will be presenting to the Board of Supervisors tomorrow the region’s plan that would allow it to accelerate the reopening of the local economy.
Health officials will tell the Board they are confident the region meets new state criteria that would allow it to move further into Stage 2 of the California resiliency roadmap. The criteria include:

Less than 5% of daily COVID-19 hospitalizations over a 7-day period or no more than 20 COVID hospitalizations on any single day in the past 14 days.
Fewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days or less than 8% testing positive in the past 7 days.
Have a capacity to be able to test 1.5 per every 1,000 residents and at least 15 staff per 100,000 county population trained and available for contact tracing.
Hospital capacity for a possible surge of 35% of hospitalizations due to COVID-19 cases in addition to providing usual care for other patients.

If the Board approves the plan, it will be immediately submitted to the California Department of Public Health for review.
“The County meets the modified metrics that have been shared with us by the state,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We will continue to monitor other metrics to inform our further opening of local businesses, organizations and activities to strike a balance between the protection of the public health and economic viability of our region.”
If the plan is approved, the County will be cleared to accelerate into Stage 2, which will include in-person dining reservations and retail shopping with social distancing.
Restaurants and retail shops are encouraged to review the state guidance for their business and complete the County’s Safe Reopening Plan, which is required to be displayed on the premises.
Most counties in the state are expected to meet the new criteria to reopen at a faster pace.
State Testing Sites
In the past few weeks, COVID-19 testing in the region has ramped up and the region is now regularly surpassing more than 4,000 a day. To date, more than 108,000 tests have been administered in the region.

173,County Approves Plan to Request Accelerated Reopening,The County Board of Supervisors today approved two measures intended to allow the region to accelerate the reopening of the local economy.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-approves-plan-to-request-accelerated-reopening/,2020-05-19T17:53:09-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today approved two measures intended to allow the region to accelerate the reopening of the local economy. Under the first, the County will submit a plan to the governor’s office that, if approved, would move San Diego further into Stage 2 of the California Resiliency Roadmap in the coming days.
Under the proposal, in-person dining at restaurants and retail shopping would be allowed, as long as businesses enact social distancing measures and follow various restrictions to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“Based on the current readiness criteria, San Diego County is ready to move to the Accelerated Stage 2 of the state’s plan,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H, County public health officer. “The County has made great progress in the fight against COVID-19 and it is now safe for certain businesses to resume operations if they can implement safety measures outlined by the County and State.”
Stage 3 Pilot Proposal
The board also approved proposing a pilot program that would allow a select number of businesses from Stage 3 to gradually reopen ahead of the schedule outlined by the state.
The pilot program includes outdoor religious services, research labs, hair and nail salons, fitness facilities, youth sports and clubs and pools at apartment complexes. The pilot program would also allow therapeutic and peer support groups to offer sessions, but with group size limited to 12 people or fewer.
The California Department of Public Health and the Governor’s Office also will have to approve the County’s pilot program proposals before businesses from these sectors can begin to reopen.

174,"Face Coverings to Be Required When Restaurants, Stores Open","As the County awaits a response from the state on its plan to allow in-person dining and shopping, health officials want people to know that face coverings and physical distancing will be required when entering these businesses.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/face-coverings-to-be-required-when-restaurants-stores-open/,2020-05-20T17:28:25-07:00,"
As the County awaits a response from the state on its plan to allow in-person dining and shopping, health officials want people to know that face coverings and physical distancing will be required when entering these businesses. In restaurants, the coverings will be needed until the customers are seated.
“As San Diegans prepare to eat out and go shopping, it’s important for people to remember they must wear a face covering when in public and close to other people,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The County is enormously grateful for the public’s effort to date.”
When you wear a face covering, you protect those around you. When others use a face covering, they protect you. When you couple face coverings with physical distancing and good hand hygiene, the risk of getting COVID-19 diminishes.
County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten wears a face covering to remind the public one is required when out in public.
Face coverings “disrupt the trajectory of a cough, sneeze or breath” preventing droplets carrying the virus from traveling between people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Two recent studies have estimated that between 12,000 and 15,000 local lives were saved because of the preventive measures.
“Had we not practiced physical distancing and respected the stay-at-home order, many thousands more individuals, including our elderly, would have died from COVID-19,” Wooten said.
COVID-19 Testing, Cases and Deaths
Testing:

4,802 tests were reported to the County May 19, and 114 or 2% were positive.

However, they must follow specific guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/whats-allowed-not-allowed-in-restaurants-stores/,2020-05-21T17:35:15-07:00,"
Restaurants and stores can now open to serve customers in person. However, they must follow specific guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Guidelines for dine-in restaurants are:

Temperature/symptom screening for employees daily
Employees with symptoms are not allowed to work
All tables need to be six feet apart or have barriers separating them
Signs need to be posted reminding customers to social distance
Employees must wear facial coverings
Customers must wear facial coverings except when seated
No self-service such as buffets, salad bars, soda machines, etc.
Encourage reservations
Expand outdoor seating

Before reopening, food businesses must fill and post the County Restaurant Operating Protocol. Additional guidance, posters and information for a safe reopening can be found on the coronavirus-sd.com page for restaurant operators website.
The County Department of Environmental Health continues conducting food safety status verifications to ensure compliance with the California Retail Food Code and provide guidance and education on the Health Officer Orders.
Retail shopping 
Customers are allowed in stores, including malls, with the following requirements:

Post signs saying no employees or customers with COVID-19 symptoms should enter
Temperature/symptom screening for employees daily
Employees and customers must wear facial coverings
Limit number of customers to maintain six feet of distance

Businesses that have not done so already need to complete a Safe Reopening Plan, post it at their entrance and discuss with their employees. Retail businesses that have been providing curbside or front-door pick-up and will now be allowing customers indoors must update their plan.
The public or employees should not enter any business if they have symptoms of COVID-19, which include cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or a new loss of taste or smell.
The plan was adopted because the County meets all the current readiness criteria and can safely move into an accelerated reopening.
As more places open to the public, it’s important for people to continue taking precautions to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19.
“Dining out and shopping must be done safely as crowded places increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19,” Wooten said. “People should continue wearing a face covering in public, maintain their distance from others, avoid touching their face and wash their hands frequently.”
While some San Diegans would like for more businesses to reopen and other activities to occur, the State has yet to allow the following to open:

Hotels, Airbnb
Gyms, fitness centers
Hair, nail salons
Beach parking lots
Sitting or lying down on the beach
Religious services, except funerals performed with social distancing

176,"County to Offer COVID-19 Testing in Rural Communities, Other Areas","As part of efforts to expand COVID-19 testing, the County will be opening sites in rural communities and other areas of the region.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-offer-covid-19-testing-in-rural-communities-other-areas/,2020-05-22T10:53:04-07:00,"
As part of efforts to expand COVID-19 testing, the County will be opening sites in rural communities and other areas of the region. New locations, starting Tuesday, will be staffed with first responders from CAL FIRE and the San Diego County Fire Authority.
“This virus knows no boundaries, so it is critical that we extend testing into our backcountry, including Julian, Pine Valley and other communities,” said District 2 Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who represents East County. “This initiative is part of our regional test, trace and treat strategy that is allowing us to track the course of the illness and help clear the way to safely restarting more of our economy.”
Free testing will be set up outside several County Library branches throughout the region’s backcountry.
“San Diego County is vast covering over 4,500 miles, which is why it’s so important to make testing available in our rural areas, like Valley Center and Borrego Springs,” said District 5 Supervisor Jim Desmond. “In order to get more people back to work and overcome the virus, we need to provide an ample amount of testing for all San Diegans.”
Drive-up testing sites will be available from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in five rural communities. An appointment is necessary, and you can make one by calling 2-1-1. The sites will be on:
May 26:           Julian Library, 1850 Highway 78, Julian, CA 92036
May 27:           Pine Valley Fire Station 44 (OLD), 28850 Old Highway 80, Pine Valley, CA 91962
May 28:           Valley Center Library, 29200 Cole Grade Road, Valley Center, CA 92082
May 29:           Borrego Springs Library, 2580 Country Club Road, Borrego Springs, CA 92004

A County testing site is now re-opened at San Diego County Credit Union Stadium in Mission Valley, operating Monday to Saturday. The hours are from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., except on Saturday’s when they change to 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. to avoid conflicting with the weekly food drive. This site can test up to 180 people daily.
On Saturdays, the County’s Live Well on Wheels Mobile Office will offer COVID-19 testing from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Euclid Health Center, located at 292 Euclid Ave.
State Testing Sites
Two state-run walk-up test sites are now open in Southeastern San Diego and El Cajon. One is located at the Tubman-Chavez Center at 415 Euclid Avenue and the other at the former San Diego County Assessor Office at 200 S. Magnolia Avenue in El Cajon.
These two sites are in addition to those already operating in Escondido and Chula Vista. All the state-run locations require appointments, which can be made at  www.lhi.care/covidtesting or by calling (888) 634-1123.
COVID-19 testing options include calling your doctor or medical provider to schedule an appointment, signing up on the state website, or calling 2-1-1.

As San Diegans head into the Memorial Day holiday weekend, the County is reminding residents to practice social distancing, avoid crowded places and cover their face when they leave their home.
“We have made great progress in flattening the curve of COVID-19, but the local health emergency is not over yet,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Local metrics are trending in the right direction and we urge San Diegans to continue to do their part so the County can proceed with its thoughtful and calculated process of reopening businesses and other activities.”
The state recently approved the County’s request to allow in-person dining at restaurants and in-store retail shopping. While restaurants can open for dine-in services, they must follow the guidance outlined in the public health order.
Restrictions Remain in Place
Customers or employees should not enter any business if they have symptoms of COVID-19, which include cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fever, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or a new loss of taste or smell.
Even though beaches are open, beach parking lots remain closed. Beachgoers should only use the beach for active recreation. Sitting or lying down on the sand is not allowed.
Despite some restrictions being lifted, the state has not cleared the following businesses or activities for reopening:

Hotels, Airbnb (except to serve essential workers)
Gyms, fitness centers
Hair, nail salons

Houses of worship, hair salons and barbershops can all resume services, but they must implement a variety of safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today. All must complete and post the County’s Safe Reopening Plan before opening.
Places of worship will have to limit attendance to 25% of capacity, or 100 people or fewer, whichever of the two is smaller.
Worshippers not in the same household will have to sit or stand six feet apart. State guidance says houses of worship should consider discontinuing singing and other practices that increase the chance of virus transmission through exhaled droplets. They also should consider or modify practices that require sharing items.
The state also gave the green light for hair salons and barbershops to reopen. Employees will have to complete a health screening at the beginning and end of each shift and both stylists and customers must wear facial coverings for the duration of the hair appointment.
While the businesses may open immediately, certain services frequently offered are not yet allowed. This includes eyelash and eyebrow services, facials and shaves.
“As an increasing number of businesses reopen, San Diegans should continue to adhere to the safety guidelines we have implemented during the pandemic,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H, County public health officer. “Being in close proximity to non-household members increases the risk of being exposed to COVID-19 and people should wear a face covering and frequently wash their hands to prevent the spread of the virus.”
The state has not yet permitted nail salons to reopen. The county expects to receive further guidance about those businesses later.
Customers or employees should not enter any business if they have symptoms of COVID-19, which include fever, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, chills, muscle pain, sore throat, or a new loss of taste or smell.
Changes to Health Order
The County also announced several additional changes to its public health order today. Going forward, all businesses will have to implement temperature and health screenings for employees. Businesses must also ensure that all employees wear facial coverings and maintain physical distancing.
Beginning Wednesday, one-on-one sports lessons are also allowed, as long as both the instructor and student comply with physical distancing and face covering requirements. Students and instructors should not share equipment.

The County and Rady Children’s Hospital today launched a new initiative to test up to 2,000 children and their families daily for COVID-19 over the next six months.
Developed with the support of the County’s T3 Strategy of test, trace and treat, the COVID Collaborative for Children will include testing at Rady hospital, clinics, as well as at the locations of Rady’s health care partners.
Rady Children’s Hospital officials said children and their parents can get a test during wellness visits at the facility or its affiliated pediatric primary care offices. The hospital also will test its entire staff.
The goal is to start with about 400 tests daily and ramp up over the next six weeks to about 2,000 tests a day. The tests will be free to all participants. Children are automatically covered under state law. Costs for adults without insurance will be paid by the County.
“COVID-19 is not a disease that only impacts older adults,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Pediatric cases have been reported in San Diego County.”
Of the nearly 7,000 COVID-19 cases in the region, 5.6% or 391 cases have been reported in children and teenagers. Also, about 52% of the cases were in people between 20 and 49 years of age.
Wooten added that it is important to offer testing to families because there have been reports of children who had COVID-19 but lacked symptoms, leaving them in a position where they could unknowingly spread the virus.
More Testing in Rural Communities
CAL FIRE and the San Diego County Fire Authority announced six more dates when testing will be offered in rural communities.
Drive-up testing sites will be available from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in five communities. An appointment is necessary, and you can make one by calling 2-1-1. The sites will be on:
June 1 & 2:   San Diego County Library, 1275 Main St., Ramona, CA 92065

180,Face Coverings Protect Others and You,"Research has shown that when face coverings are used properly, they reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/face-coverings-protect-others-and-you/,2020-05-28T08:48:04-07:00,"
Are you wearing a face covering when out and around others? If not, you should.
Research has shown that when face coverings are used properly, they reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.
Face coverings are important because people can have COVID-19 and transmit the virus, but not have any symptoms.
“Since we can’t be sure who is contagious, the best protection is to have everyone two years and older cover their face,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
When you wear a face covering, you protect those around you. When others use a face covering, they protect you.
The County’s local Health Officer Order requires San Diegans to wear a face covering when in public and less than six feet from others, or any time they enter a business, except when its use is prevented by a medical condition.
Face coverings “disrupt the trajectory of a cough, sneeze or breath” preventing droplets carrying the virus from traveling between people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC recently updated its guidance to note that the virus spreads very easily between people, even more so than influenza.
The strategy is most effective when compliance is high. Countries that recommend or require their citizens to wear face coverings in public have been shown to be more successful in their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, see Face Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review.
The cloth face coverings, which will be required until further notice, don’t have to be hospital grade. N-95 respirators and surgical masks should be reserved for health care workers. But they should cover the nose and mouth.
Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable, since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don’t need to be used when people are at home.
The CDC indicates cloth face coverings should:

Fit snugly but comfortably against the side of the face
Be secured with ties or ear loops
Include multiple layers of fabric
Allow for breathing without restriction
Be able to be laundered and machine dried without damage or change to shape

San Diegans are required to wear a facial covering while in public and close to other people.
Where to Wear a Face Covering

Face coverings must be worn in public settings, such as:
Waiting in line to go inside a store
Shopping in a store
Picking up food at a restaurant
Waiting for or riding on public transportation
Riding in a taxi or ride service vehicle
Seeking health care
Going into facilities allowed to stay open
Working an essential job that interacts with the public

Face coverings will be required in public until further notice.
Face coverings are not required:

At home
In the car alone or with members of the same household
When advised by a medical doctor
For children under 2 years old due to the risk of suffocation
When swimming, walking, hiking, bicycling or running provided there is social distancing

People who choose not to wear face coverings may be cited and denied access to businesses, transit or recreational areas.

Starting June 2, people will be allowed to sit and lounge at local beaches provided they maintain physical distancing or wear a face covering when close to others, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Sitting on the beach will be allowed for sunbathing and relaxing with towels and chairs if you do it with people in your own household. However, no activities such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Parking lots will remain closed.
All beach communities agreed to ease this restriction starting June 2, but cities can decide if they want to proceed later and how the guideline is going to be enforced.
Plasma from Recovered COVID-19 Cases Needed
The San Diego Blood Bank is partnering with the County to encourage San Diegans who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. It could help treat people who are hospitalized or seriously ill from the novel virus.
While currently there is no vaccine or proven treatment for COVID-19, what’s known as convalescent plasma may help patients fighting the virus because the plasma has antibodies against it. The effort supports the County’s T3 Strategy of test, trace and treat.
“This partnership helps us to achieve one of the indicators at the federal level for treatment of COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We’re very excited about this partnership.”
Any of the more than 7,000 people who tested positive for COVID-19 and have recovered could donate plasma.
To donate convalescent plasma, people must also meet the regular screening criteria for blood donation. Donor information will be kept confidential and used for screening purposes only.
“It’s quite simple, but tremendously impactful,” said David Wellis, chief executive officer of the San Diego Blood Bank.
Wellis said 377 doses of convalescent plasma have been distributed across Southern California, especially San Diego County, but more is needed.
“The current hospital demand for (COVID-19 convalescent plasma) is great, but we’re not meeting the demand. And that sets the stage for this very innovative partnership,” Wellis said.
Anyone Can Get Tested for COVID-19
COVID-19 testing is now more widely available in the region. Testing options include calling your doctor or medical provider to schedule an appointment, signing up on the state website, or calling 2-1-1.
“Given the testing priorities provided at the federal, state and local level, anyone who wants a test can get it,” Wooten said.
County public health nurse administers a COVID-19 test.
The County is opening additional COVID-19 testing sites for people who are not showing symptoms of the virus. A doctor’s referral is not required, but an appointment is necessary. To make an appointment, you should call 2-1-1.
People who are showing symptoms of COVID-19 are encouraged to contact their health care provider and arrange for testing. If you don’t have a health care provider, you should call 2-1-1 and ask for a public health nurse who will give you a referral.

Only passive activities will be allowed and no gatherings or sports such as football and volleyball will be permitted. Parking lots will remain closed.
While these new activities are now allowed, it’s up to individual beach jurisdictions to determine if they want to proceed with the new guidance and how they’re going to enforce it.
County Waiting to Move Further into Stage 3
The County continues to wait for word from Gov. Gavin Newsom on guidance for reopening additional sectors of the economy, as well as schools, and move further into Stage 3.
Once the new guidance is available, the County will review it and determine which businesses and activities can reopen or occur. They include youth sports, gyms, nail salons, community pools and sporting events with no spectators.
Health officials encouraged San Diegans to be patient and continue practicing social distancing, wearing a face covering when in public and near others, and washing their hands regularly.
“We must continue to be vigilant and maintain strategies to decrease the spread of COVID-19, as we have reopened businesses and increased activities,” said Wilma Wooten, County public health officer.
Face coverings are required in public and within six feet of someone who is not a household member.

186,What to Expect If a Contact Tracer Calls You,"If you get a call from a number you don’t recognize, don’t automatically ignore it. The person on the other end could be calling from County Public Health Services to tell you you’ve been exposed to COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/what-to-expect-if-a-contact-tracer-calls-you/,2020-06-02T09:21:04-07:00,"
If you get a call from a number you don’t recognize, don’t automatically ignore it.
The person on the other end could be calling from County Public Health Services to tell you you’ve been exposed to COVID-19.
The County has been scaling up its contact tracing efforts as some stay-at-home restrictions are eased and people are out more and heading back to work.
Contact tracing is done by local and state health departments when certain infectious diseases are reported. This is a classic method that public health has been using for decades.
The County has been doing contact tracing of positive COVID-19 cases in the region. To date, the entire COVID-19 disease control response team consists of about 400 disease fighters of which there are more than 200 contact tracers and more being trained. Since May 4, the team has investigated more than 3,100 close contacts in cases where tracing activities were initiated. Nearly 85% of these close contacts were associated with the same household as a confirmed case.
County Communicable Disease Investigator Ernie Awa conducts contact tracing training.
Why is Contact Tracing Important?
When trying to contain or mitigate the spread of COVID-19, time, and contact tracers, are of the essence.
Tracers need to identify close contacts of a positive case immediately and make sure they do not interact with others. This is critical to protect communities from further spread of the virus.
To effectively do that, the County has determined that 450 contact tracers need to be hired and trained.
“Without robust contact tracing in place, the spread of COVID-19 is likely to increase to the point that the region would need to step back and adopt strict mitigation strategies to contain the virus,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
What a Contact Tracer Needs to Know
When a confirmed case is investigated by Public Health staff, the investigator works with the case to identify all close contacts who may have been exposed. Contact tracers take it from there and attempt to get in touch with all these contacts so that they can be self-quarantined at home and monitored for symptoms of COVID-19, which typically are a fever, cough or shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.
If you test positive for COVID-19, your doctor or another health official will let you know. A positive case must be reported to County Public Health Services so that each confirmed case can be used to help in identifying others who may have been exposed. Contact tracing can start the process of reaching out to the close contacts.
“When a contact tracer calls you, it is important that you answer because immediate action is needed,” Wooten said.
If you don’t answer, the contact tracer should leave a voicemail message. Call the contact tracer back because they need to know that you have isolated yourself and who you have had close contact with.
The contact tracer will identify themselves as being part of the County and all information gathered during the contact tracing effort is kept confidential. The goal is developing trust and a partnership with the contact to fight the virus together and slow the spread.
What to Do if You’ve Been Exposed to COVID-19
Tracers call those who were a close contact with a person with COVID-19. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a close contact is someone who was within six feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes starting from 48 hours before symptoms developed in the case and until the time the patient is isolated.
If you are placed under self-quarantine, this is what you will be asked to do:

Stay home as much as possible for 14 days
Maintain physical distance from others who were not exposed
Monitor yourself for symptoms and take your temperature twice daily
Do not share utensils, cups or glasses
Use good hand hygiene and wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water

“We now know that people without symptoms can spread COVID-19. That’s why it’s important that people who were exposed to someone with the virus stay home and away from others,” Dr. Wooten said.
A County Public Health nurse or health care worker might also check on you occasionally to make sure you’re staying away from others to find out if you’ve developed symptoms and link you to support and services you might need.
If you are identified as a close contact and develop symptoms, you should immediately isolate yourself and notify your case manager and your doctor to get care and testing if needed. If you don’t have a place to isolate, the county will provide a paid hotel for the duration of the isolation.
Until a vaccine is available, contact tracing will be an important activity to further prevent the spread of COVID-19 in our region.

187,Triggers to Modify Health Officer Order Updated,"Even as the County continues to allow additional activities within its health order, it is refining criteria that would prompt renewed restrictions.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/triggers-to-modify-health-officer-order-updated/,2020-06-02T18:21:01-07:00,"
Even as the County continues to allow additional activities within its health order, it is refining criteria that would prompt renewed restrictions.
A set of 13 triggers was shown to the Board of Supervisors during an update on the County’s COVID-19 response at their meeting Tuesday. The variety of data indicators reviewed would lead public health officials to pull back on the reopening of the local economy.
The modification of the health order would be triggered if any of the following criteria was met:

More than seven new COVID-19 outbreaks in community settings in a 7-day period
A total of 50% or fewer local hospitals have at least a 15-day supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) at hospitals over a rolling 3-day period
Less than 20% of the county’s ICU beds available

The health order would also be modified if a combination of one or more of the remaining criteria in two or more of three categories are met. See full list of triggers.
“The data in San Diego is trending in the right direction but as more businesses reopen, we need to be prepared for a spike in COVID-19 infections,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H, County public health officer. “The triggers presented to the board today will allow us to better monitor the capacity of the local healthcare system and base decisions about the reopening of further sectors of the economy on local metrics.”
The board also directed staff to prepare a report for the June 23 board meeting that details how the County will continue to protect its most vulnerable residents from COVID-19.
The meeting came as the latest revision to the health order went into effect, allowing people to sit or lie down on the beach. They need to remain with household members. Cities can have tighter restrictions, so beachgoers should check before visiting. Parking lots at beaches remain closed.

Thirteen and three.
Thirteen is the number of triggers the County will be monitoring to make sure it is OK to continue a further reopening of the local economy.
On their own, any of the following criteria – increasing community outbreaks, limited intensive care unit capacity and a dwindling supply of personal protective equipment  – would indicate a worsening of COVID-19 activity in the region and cause modifications to the Health Officer Order.
Combinations of the other ten triggers also can cause a modification of the Health Officer Order.
To help the public understand and monitor COVID-19 activity in the region, the County has launched a dashboard of all 13 triggers that would show a green or a red color depending on the current situation. Some triggers will be updated daily and others periodically, depending on the availability of data.
“All of the triggers are now green, and this is very good news,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “However, people must continue to follow public health guidance to ensure these triggers stay green.”
Wooten added that given the region’s current successes in responding to COVID-19 she is comfortable with the County having the authority to set its own pace to move into Stage 3 of reopening.
“We recognize that the community is hurting in terms of businesses being closed,” Wooten said. “Our metrics support the fact that we can open…We hope that other industries will also open up.”

190,Mosquito in Black Mountain Ranch Area Tests Positive for West Nile Virus,"A mosquito caught in routine trapping in the Black Mountain Ranch area has tested positive for West Nile virus, the first appearance of the virus in San Diego County in 2020.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/mosquito-in-black-mountain-ranch-area-tests-positive-for-west-nile-virus/,2020-06-05T09:03:45-07:00,"
A mosquito caught in routine trapping in the Black Mountain Ranch area has tested positive for West Nile virus, the first appearance of the virus in San Diego County in 2020.
County environmental health officials reminded people to protect themselves from mosquitoes that can potentially transmit disease by following the County’s “Prevent, Protect, Report” guidelines — including finding and dumping out standing water in yards and around homes to keep mosquitoes from breeding.
Incidences of West Nile virus were mild in San Diego County in 2019. Three people tested positive, but there were no fatalities and all three people were suspected of having contracted the virus while outside of the county.
However, West Nile virus remains a potentially deadly threat in San Diego County and the state. In 2015, 44 San Diego County residents tested positive for West Nile virus and six of them died. In 2019, 225 California residents became sick from West Nile virus and six died, according to the California Department of Public Health.
West Nile virus is mainly a bird disease, but it can be transmitted to humans by a number of species of mosquitoes — including Culex mosquitoes native to San Diego and, less effectively, by invasive Aedes aegypti mosquitoes also found in San Diego County — if they feed off an infected animal, mainly birds, and then bite people.
Eight out of 10 people who get infected never suffer any symptoms. The 20% who do generally suffer mild symptoms including headache, fever, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. But in rare cases, West Nile virus can make people extremely ill and even kill them.
Additional Mosquito-Borne Illness Worries
Protecting against mosquitoes has become even more important for San Diego County residents in recent years. Since 2014, three types of day-biting, invasive Aedes mosquitoes have been found in San Diego County. All of these mosquitoes like to live and breed near people, in yards and even inside homes. Two of these species can potentially transmit diseases not naturally found here. Those include chikungunya, dengue and Zika — but only if mosquitoes first bite an infected person. In general, that means local invasive Aedes mosquitoes could only transmit those diseases if they found and bit San Diego County residents who picked up the virus while traveling and returned home still infected.
County officials reiterated that people should help protect themselves from mosquitoes and potential illnesses by following the County’s “Prevent, Protect, Report” guidelines.
Prevent mosquito breeding
San Diego County residents may be more vulnerable to being bitten by mosquitoes around their homes now because many have been spending more time at home because of the coronavirus pandemic. So remember to dump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as stagnant swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.
Protect yourself from mosquito bites
Protect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use insect repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.
Report possible mosquito activity and dead birds
Report increased mosquito activity, or stagnant, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds — dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls — to environmental health’s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov. Also report if you are being bitten by mosquitoes during daylight hours, or if you find mosquitoes that look like invasive Aedes mosquitoes — small, black with white stripes on legs and backs — by contacting the Vector Control Program at (858) 694-2888.
For more information about mosquito-borne illnesses, go to San Diego County’s “Fight the Bite” website.
Here are some tips to help keep your yard from becoming a mosquito breeding ground.

191,Beach Parking Lots Can Reopen Tuesday,"Starting June 9, beachgoers will be allowed to park in lots at local beaches, the County announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/beach-parking-lots-can-reopen-tuesday/,2020-06-05T17:59:46-07:00,"
Starting June 9, beachgoers will be allowed to park in lots at local beaches, the County announced today. Individual coastal communities may elect to enforce stricter regulations on parking lots in their area, so beachgoers should check whether lots at specific beaches are open before heading out the door.
Late today, the County also received further guidance from the state about a number of additional sectors that can reopen, with restrictions, as early as Friday, June 12. The County received reopening guidelines for the following industries:

Gyms
Hotels
Bars and wineries
Museums, galleries, zoos and aquariums
Professional sports without spectators
Day camps
Campgrounds and RV parks
Family entertainment (bowling alleys, batting cages, etc.)
Card rooms and racetracks
Music, film and television production

The County is evaluating the state guidance and will provide a timeline for individual sectors in the coming days. While the state guidance provides public health modifications that should be in place prior to the reopening of individual sectors, the county public health officer will make the final decision about when individual industries can reopen based on local COVID-19 data.
“As we reopen businesses and increase activities, we must continue to be vigilant and maintain strategies to decrease the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H, County public health officer. “Practicing good hand hygiene, maintaining physical distance when you come into contact with individuals outside your household and using a face covering help prevent the spread of this virus.”
Symptomatic San Diegans, especially people who participated in recent protests, are encouraged to get tested for COVID-19.
People showing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact their health care provider and arrange for testing. If you don’t have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 and ask for a public health nurse who will give you a referral.
Residents without symptoms who want to get a COVID-19 test should check first with their health care provider. They can also get tested at a state or County site where tests are administered for free.

They must also make sure employees and customers get a temperature or symptom screening, use face coverings when not eating or drinking, maintain physical distancing and practice good hand hygiene.
Over the weekend, day camps, campgrounds, RV parks, and outdoor recreation such as sports fishing and charter boats could begin reopening. Tomorrow, coastal cities can reopen parking lots at beaches.
“As we reopen more businesses, we must continue to be vigilant and take preventive measures,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Each of us is responsible and has a role to play to make sure cases do not increase.”
The following businesses must remain closed until further notice:

Nail and facial salons
Tattoo parlors
Therapeutic massage businesses
Conventions
Concerts

If You Protest, Get a Test
County health officials are recommending that everyone who participates in a protest, consider being tested for COVID-19 because they are at higher risk of contracting the virus.
Large gatherings and people being close to each other increase the risk of contracting COVID-19 because people can transmit the virus when chanting, screaming or talking, especially if they are not wearing a face covering.
“It is likely that we will see cases in people who have participated in the recent protests,” Wooten said. “People should be tested and be on the lookout for symptoms.”
Residents without symptoms wishing to get a COVID-19 test should check first with their health care provider. They can also get tested at a state or County site where tests are administered for free.
People showing symptoms of COVID-19 should contact their health care provider and arrange for testing. If you don’t have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 and ask for a public health nurse who will give you a referral.
Everyone who wants to get tested needs an appointment.

For County site appointments, call 2-1-1.
For state sites, make an appointment online or call 888-634-1123. State sites are in Escondido, El Cajon, Chula Vista, San Ysidro and Southeastern San Diego.

County public health nurse administers a COVID-19 test.
CAL FIRE and the San Diego County Fire Authority continue to schedule free testing in rural communities through 2-1-1.
Drive-up testing sites will be available from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in three communities. An appointment is necessary, and you can make one by calling 2-1-1. The sites will be on:

193,County Identifies Projects to Dramatically Reduce Tijuana River Valley Sewage,"The County of San Diego has released a report that identifies 27 projects that could potentially reduce the flow of sewage from Mexico into the U.S. and Tijuana River Valley each year by as much as 91%, from 138 days to 12.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-identifies-projects-to-dramatically-reduce-tijuana-river-valley-sewage/,2020-06-09T13:06:04-07:00,"
The County of San Diego has released a report that identifies 27 projects that could potentially reduce the flow of sewage from Mexico into the U.S. and Tijuana River Valley each year by as much as 91%, from 138 days to 12.
The report, the Tijuana River Valley Needs and Opportunities Assessment, identifies strategies to manage impacts from sewage, trash, and sediment on the U.S. side of the border. It was created in collaboration with more than 30 agencies and organizations, numerous meetings and the review of more than 600 documents.
The report will now proceed to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for consideration. Last month, the federal EPA said up to $300 million from the new United States-Mexico-Canda Agreement would be considered for projects to address the U.S.-Mexico border water issue. An oversight committee at the EPA will be formed and projects identified for funding.
San Diego County is advocating for the majority of those federal dollars to be used for this region.  It will also participate in developing the implementation plan with EPA, other federal agencies and local partners.
Numerous local, state and federal agencies and organizations, including the United States International Boundary Water Commission and the state and federal EPAs, are involved in border water quality issue. The County’s Department of Environmental Health monitors beach water quality on the U.S. side of the border and notifies the public when water quality is not safe for swimming and recreating.
The report was developed by county staff and engineering consultants with funding provided through California Senate Bill 507, sponsored by State Senator Ben Hueso among others.
County Board of Supervisors Chairman Greg Cox has championed efforts to resolve the water-quality issue for more than a decade.
“Our County has been at the forefront of finding solutions to the persistent sewage problems in the Tijuana River Valley, and this study goes a long way to achieving that,” Cox said. “Thanks to my colleagues at the federal, state, and local level who have all worked tirelessly to advocate for and secure this federal funding, we are now ready to work with the EPA to identify the projects that will have the most impact in capturing, diverting and treating sewage so that we can finally reclaim and enjoy our beaches in the South Bay.”
According to the report, implementation of the identified projects could reduce the number of days that sewage flows across the border from 138 days per year to just 12. That equates to the capture and treatment of up to 163 million gallons per day on the U.S. side of the border.
The structural projects recommended in the report include pump stations, sewage treatment facilities, detention basins, trash traps and screens, quarry and estuary restoration. The report also includes trash clean-up, habitat restoration, and expanded water-quality monitoring to supplement the infrastructure improvements.
The projects focus on four drainage areas in the Tijuana River Valley: the Tijuana River, Smuggler’s Gulch, Goat Canyon, and Yogurt Canyon. However, the projects are prioritized by the greatest return on investment, leaving the Tijuana River high on the list because that is where the flows are the greatest.
To improve water quality, the report explores three major approaches:

Diverting sewage flows from the Tijuana River flows not captured on the Mexico side, building additional sewage treatment capacity on the U.S. side of the border, and discharging the treated water into the deep ocean
Diverting those same overflows directly to the South Bay Ocean Outfall without treatment
Use of in-stream basins to capture transboundary flows within the Tijuana River and/or canyon tributaries before flows reach the Tijuana River Estuary or the ocean.

“Several communities across the nation have seen a spike in case numbers after reopening their economies,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We need to remain vigilant and continue to use the measures that have slowed the spread of COVID-19.”

196,San Diego Woman Dies from Vaping-Related Lung Injury,"A 76-year-old woman who died on May 24 is the first local fatality of e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI), the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-woman-dies-from-vaping-related-lung-injury/,2020-06-11T12:01:19-07:00,"
A 76-year-old woman who died on May 24 is the first local fatality of e-cigarette or vaping-associated lung injury (EVALI), the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Three other EVALI cases in young adults were confirmed in recent weeks and they are the first reports of the lung illness in San Diego County since 2019.
All the newly reported local cases tested negative for the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, and they all reported recently vaping products containing tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC).
The California Department of Public Health recently recognized new reports of confirmed EVALI cases in persons vaping THC-containing products in April, after no cases had been reported since February 2020.
Since July 2019, a total of 52 EVALI cases have been reported in San Diego County residents. All patients had to be hospitalized.
“While our community is understandably focused on COVID-19, it is important to remember that lung injury from vaping is still a major public health concern,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People who vape, especially those using THC-containing products, are urged to stop.”
In January, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted to restrict the sale of flavored smoking products and e-cigarette and vaping devices in the County’s unincorporated areas. These restrictions were proposed as a response to the e-cigarette or vaping associated lung injury cases in the county and across the county. Enforcement of these restrictions will begin July 1.
THC containing e-cigarette or vaping products, particularly obtained from informal sources, are linked to most e-cigarette or vaping, lung injury cases. Vitamin E acetate has also been strongly linked to the outbreak and has been found in product samples from patients and in-patient lung fluid samples.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that people not use THC-containing e-cigarettes or vaping products obtained from informal sources such as friends, family, pop-up shops or online sellers. Additionally, the CDC says that youth, young adults, or pregnant women should never use e-cigarette or vaping products.
For more information about lung injury associated with e-cigarettes or vaping visit the County EVALI webpage, the CDPH Tobacco Free California webpage or the CDC EVALI outbreak webpage.

198,"Face Coverings, Physical Distance Needed to Prevent Surge of COVID-19","If people don't wear a face covering and maintain physical distance, a surge of COVID-19 could occur, forcing the County to slow, stop or dial back the reopening of the local economy.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/face-coverings-physical-distance-needed-to-prevent-surge-of-covid-19/,2020-06-11T16:17:11-07:00,"
As people head back to work or resume some of their normal activities, County health officials are reminding the public to continue doing three things to prevent a surge of COVID-19: wear a face covering, keep their distance from others and wash their hands regularly.
Research has shown that when face coverings are used properly, they reduce transmission of the novel coronavirus. Maintaining physical distance from other people does too.
The latest is a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study of sailors at the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt which showed that sailors who used a face covering and practiced social distancing had a lower infection rate.
“We now have more scientific evidence that face coverings prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “When people are in public the risk of exposure is higher so they should wear a face covering, especially when they’re within six feet from others.”
Face coverings are important because they disrupt the trajectory of droplets when people cough or sneeze. Also, people can have COVID-19 and transmit the virus, but not have any symptoms.
In addition to the CDC, the World Health Organization is also now recommending that people wear a face covering when in public and close to others.
In San Diego County, about 10% of all the people who tested positive for COVID-19 had no symptoms, which means they could have been unknowingly transmitting the virus to others.
Furthermore, adjacent counties and states have seen an increase in cases and no travel restrictions are in place within the United States.
Face coverings are required in public until further notice.
If San Diegans fail to heed the public health advice, the region could experience an increase in cases which would require the County to slow, stop or dial back the reopening of the local economy.
“When you wear a face covering, you protect those around you. When others use a face covering, they protect you,” Wooten said. “The COVID-19 pandemic is not over and this dangerous virus remains in circulation throughout the community. People should not get complacent and continue heeding the guidance given to protect themselves and others.”
The County’s local Health Officer Order requires San Diegans to wear a face covering when in public and less than six feet from others, or any time they enter a business, except when its use is prevented by a medical condition.
Face coverings will be required in public until further notice.
“People who choose not to wear face coverings should stay home. They may be cited and denied access to businesses, transit or recreational areas,” said Wooten, adding that people should also wash their hands properly and regularly to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

The County has launched a new website that will make it easier for San Diegans to get a COVID-19 test. You can choose a site by location or day and make an appointment online.
The test sites listed on the page prioritize San Diegans who do not have health insurance or cannot access a test site offered by their health care provider. Insurance carriers must cover COVID-19 tests at no cost to their members, even if the person seeking the test is not showing symptoms.
New East County Test Site
Starting Monday, the County and Sycuan will open a new public testing location at the Sycuan Recreational Center, 5577 Dehesa Road, El Cajon, 92019.
The free drive-up tests are being provided by specially trained first responders from the Sycuan Fire Department. Testing will take place Monday through Thursday between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. Anyone who wants to get tested is asked to schedule an appointment through the County’s new online system or by calling 2-1-1.
The partnership expands public COVID-19 testing options in the East County.
“I greatly appreciate the collaboration between the leadership at Sycuan and the County public health team,” said Supervisor Dianne Jacob. “This is a great example of two governments coming together to put public safety first.”
CAL FIRE and the San Diego County Fire Authority teamed up to train the Sycuan Emergency Medical Services team, which will administer the tests. The testing supplies will be provided by the County Public Health Lab.
“Sycuan is proud to partner with San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency in proactively addressing the public health needs of our tribal members and team members,” said chairman Cody Martinez, Sycuan Band of the Kumeyaay Nation. “We are well positioned to assist in outreach to Native Americans as well as frontline essential employees, public safety and fire personnel through the East County, as well as our team members.”
No Appointment Testing
For those seeking same-day testing without an appointment, the County is offering an additional COVID-19 test site at South Bay Urgent Care at 1628 Palm Avenue.
Located in the city of San Diego, near its border with Imperial Beach, the clinic is offering drive-up testing Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. While tests are typically covered by insurance, the County is supplying up to 20 tests per day to cover County residents who do not have insurance.
Nail Salons, Tattoo Parlors Next to Reopen
The state provided guidance for several additional businesses that can reopen, with restrictions, as early as Friday, June 19:

Personal care
Nail salons
Massage parlors
Aestheticians

The business owners need to follow state guidance and complete the County’s Safe Reopening Plan.
“As more businesses reopen and activities increase, the County must continue to be vigilant and utilize all the strategies available to us to decrease the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H, County public health officer. “Every one of us has a role and can take action to make a difference in curbing COVID-19.”

201,County Opens Cool Zones to Help San Diegans Beat the Heat,A select number of County Cool Zones are opening Monday to provide much-needed relief from soaring temperatures. The seven Cool Zones are air-conditioned and located throughout the hottest areas of the County.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-opens-cool-zones-to-help-san-diegans-beat-the-heat/,2020-06-13T08:12:37-07:00,"
A select number of County Cool Zones are opening Monday to provide much-needed relief from soaring temperatures. The seven Cool Zones are air-conditioned and located throughout the hottest areas of the County.
The locations are:

Borrego Springs Library
Fallbrook Community Center
Lakeside Community Center
Potrero Branch Library
Santa Ysabel Nature Center
Spring Valley Community Center
Valley Center Branch Library

All sites will be open from noon to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday. Animals, except service animals, are not permitted at any of these Cool Zone locations. The libraries are offering their sites only, no library services.
Due to COVID-19, safety measures will be in place to protect the health of Cool Zone visitors and staff. Anyone entering a County Cool Zone will have their temperature taken. All visitors and staff must also wear face coverings and practice social distancing.
“Although we need to take steps to keep seniors safe, it still remains important to also keep them cool,” said Supervisor Dianne Jacob. “Cool Zones provide a refuge during the hot summer months, so it’s helpful the County has developed a plan to get them open.”
The Cool Zones program is offered in partnership with the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency Aging & Independence Services and San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E). It was started by Supervisor Jacob in 2001 to allow seniors and people with disabilities to escape extreme heat during the summer.
Homebound individuals, those lacking transportation, and those who decide to stay home due to the risk of COVID-19, may be eligible to receive a free electric fan. The County, in partnership with SDG&E, provides fans to San Diegans who are living on limited incomes.
To be eligible for a free fan, a resident must not have access to an air-conditioned space at their home or apartment building. To learn more about the fan program or to request a fan, call Aging & Independence Services at (800) 339-4661.
“We want to thank our SDG&E community partner for making this program available to give some relief from the heat to our more vulnerable residents,” said Supervisor Jim Desmond, whose district covers parts of North County out to the desert.
“SDG&E appreciates and supports the County of San Diego for initiating the Cool Zones program back in 2001 and for making it such a success,” said Jessica Packard, SDG&E communications manager. “The County’s leadership has benefitted our region for almost 20 years and SDG&E is proud to be a part of this program since its inception.”

202,"County Urging Public, Businesses to Help Prevent COVID-19 Outbreaks","If seven or more outbreaks occur over a seven-day period, the County would be forced to modify the local Health Officer Order and take additional measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-urging-public-businesses-to-help-prevent-covid-19-outbreaks/,2020-06-15T16:42:23-07:00,"
Community outbreaks of COVID-19 are one of 13 triggers the County is closely monitoring to determine whether to stop or dial back the reopening of the local economy.
If seven or more outbreaks occur over a seven-day period, the County would be forced to modify the local Health Officer Order and take additional measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. An outbreak consists of three or more cases.
Over the past seven days, four outbreaks have been traced back to community settings, such as people’s homes, food manufacturers, churches and restaurants. The County is contacting anyone at those locations identified as close contacts of positive cases.
County health officials are asking the public and local businesses to adhere to the local public health guidance to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks.
“If we start to see an increasing number of community outbreaks, that would be a sign that COVID-19 is spreading at a faster rate because people are not following the public health guidance,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “That could result in the closure of businesses or certain sectors or even a full stop in the reopening of the local economy.”
Here’s how you can help to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks:

If you’re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.
If you need to be in public, you must use a face covering if you are close to people outside your household. The coverings help prevent asymptomatic carriers of the virus from spreading it.
Maintain physical distance from others.
Avoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw it away and wash your hands.
Wash your hands properly and regularly or use a hand sanitizer.
If you’re out and about and notice that a business is not following the health guidance, report them to your local police department by calling the non-emergency number.

“We all have a role in preventing the spread of COVID-19,” Wooten said. “If people don’t cooperate, we could see an increase in cases and outbreaks.”
County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten.
State Says “I Do” to Weddings 
The state has lifted its restriction on weddings, and they can now occur provided they follow the state guidance. No wedding receptions are permitted.
Indoor weddings are not to exceed 25 percent of a facility’s capacity or 100 people and participants must wear a face covering and maintain physical distancing. Face coverings and social distancing are required for outdoor weddings.
COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths
Testing:

5,207 tests were reported to the County June 14 and 3% were positive new cases.
The 14-day, rolling average percentage of positive tests is 3%.

Cases:

170 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 9,610.
1,530 or 15.9% of cases have required hospitalization.
429 or 5% of all cases and 28.0% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

One additional COVID-19 death was reported, bringing the region’s total to 320.
The 78-year-old man died June 7 and had underlying medical conditions.

203,County Hits Community Outbreaks Trigger as Masks Become Mandatory Across California,"Two more COVID-19 community outbreaks were identified in the region June 17, bringing the region’s seven-day total to eight, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-hits-community-outbreaks-trigger-as-masks-become-mandatory-across-california/,2020-06-18T17:05:00-07:00,"
Two more COVID-19 community outbreaks were identified in the region June 17, bringing the region’s seven-day total to eight, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The eight outbreaks, which are not linked, surpass the County’s threshold of no more than seven outbreaks over a seven-day period.
Because of that, the County is pausing on the reopening of additional sectors of the economy until it is safe to do it. However, businesses that were scheduled to reopen June 19 can proceed.
Also, the County will be stepping up enforcement on entities that are not following the public health guidance, just like it did with the closure of a restaurant in Pacific Beach.
County health officials are also urging San Diegans to adhere to the local public health guidance, or the County will be forced to take more drastic measures.
“We can’t be doing everything like we did before COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We need your help to prevent community outbreaks and to stop the spread of COVID-19.”
Community outbreaks is one of 13 triggers the County is closely monitoring to determine whether to stop or dial back the reopening of the local economy.
Currently, there are 15 active community outbreaks in San Diego County. An outbreak in a community setting is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.
The eight outbreaks occurred at three businesses, three restaurants, a private home, a campground and a social club. The County is contacting anyone at those locations identified as close contacts of positive cases.
The County is urging San Diegans to continue taking precautions to prevent outbreaks and stop the spread of COVID-19.
Here’s how you can help to prevent an outbreak and the spread of COVID-19.

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if you’re sick

“People are assuming that things are back to normal and that is not the case,” Wooten said. “There should be no friends or family gatherings or dinner or cocktail parties.”
Face Coverings Mandatory Statewide
Today, the State issued new guidance that now requires all Californians to wear a face covering when in public and close to people outside their household. People must wear face coverings when they are in high-risk situations such as:

Inside of, or in line to enter, any indoor public space
Getting services at a doctor’s office, hospital, pharmacy, dental office, veterinary clinic or blood bank
Waiting for or riding on public transportation or while in a taxi, private car service, or ride-sharing vehicle
Interacting with any member of the public and walking through hallways, stairways or parking facilities

Face coverings are required in public and within six feet of someone who is not a household member.
COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths
Testing:

Of 10,070 tests reported to the County June 17 and 2% were positive new cases. The total includes a batch of prior tests.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests, shown in the first attached chart, is 2.8%.

Cases:

238 new cases in San Diego County residents for a total of 10,092.
1,578 or 15.6% of cases have required hospitalization.

204,It’s Kitten Season: Adopt One or Two!,"Sprinkle some joy into your life with a fun and frolicking kitten. The San Diego County Department of Animal Services is hoping to find forever homes for several litters who are now available – and if this week isn’t a good time, don’t worry, more kittens will be ready in the weeks ahead.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/its-kitten-season-adopt-one-or-two/,2020-06-19T11:16:38-07:00,"

Sprinkle some joy into your life with a fun and frolicking kitten. The San Diego County Department of Animal Services is hoping to find forever homes for several litters who are now available – and if this week isn’t a good time, don’t worry, more kittens will be ready in the weeks ahead.
Currently, Animal Services is only offering Touchless Adoptions to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and protect both the public and shelter staff. Please do not come to either of the shelters without first calling 619-767-2675 to make an appointment. Potential adopters are asked to browse Animal Service’s website for available kittens, cats and more, then fill out an application for the animal(s) they want and email it to DASInfo@sdcounty.ca.gov. Animal Services staff will contact people in the order their application was received and conduct the adoption process over the phone.
Once the lucky person is approved to adopt a new furry family member, they will be scheduled for an appointment to come to one of the shelter locations to pick up the kitten, cat or other animal.
From now through October every year, underage kittens pour through the shelter doors. Since it is kitten season, Animal Services would also like to remind people that if they see a litter of kittens out in the “wild” such as a community trail or residential area, please hold off on immediately scooping them up to try to rescue them – their mother will likely return to care for them.
If the kittens aren’t in immediate danger from such things as traffic or predators and aren’t visibly sick or injured, it’s best to observe them for a while to see if a mother cat will return – often she is just away from her kittens temporarily. Be sure to watch from a safe distance so the mother cat feels safe enough to return to her babies.
If you don’t see a mother cat return after six hours and feel the kittens need care, you can make an appointment to bring them to an animal shelter or try to care for them yourself. Many local pet stores carry kitten milk replacer and the proper bottles (please don’t use an eyedropper Bottle feeding kittens can be rewarding, but very time intensive, since round-the-clock feedings are needed until the kittens are old enough to eat solid food.
Keep in mind, age is a critical factor in found kittens’ ability to thrive (you can learn more about estimating a kitten’s age here). Neonatal kittens are four weeks and under and are still nursing; they cannot survive on their own and need special care. Contact your veterinarian for details on caring for neonates.
If you decide to bring neonatal kittens to the shelter, staff will make every effort to find a partner shelter, foster caregiver, or rescue organization to properly care for these youngsters. If the kitten is not eating on its own and still nursing from the bottle, staff must find a rescue for it immediately as the shelter does not have overnight staff to care for neonatal kittens. Underage kittens also cannot be vaccinated yet and are susceptible to illnesses in a shelter environment. For these reasons, the kittens you may find are best off staying with their mother, if possible, until they are eight weeks of age.
That’s why it’s so important to help reduce the number of unwanted kittens by spaying and neutering your cats, the free-roaming cats you see in your neighborhood, and by encouraging your neighbors to alter their cats. County Animal Services sees hundreds upon hundreds of kittens come in every year and there are a very limited number of foster homes or rescues for them all, so any support you may be able to offer these little ones is always much appreciated!

206,"COVID-19 Outbreaks, Cases Increase; 14-day Rolling Percentage Remains Low","Three additional COVID-19 community outbreaks were reported today, bringing the region’s total to 10 over the past seven days. Also, more than 300 positive cases have been reported two days in a row.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-outbreaks-cases-increase-14-day-rolling-percentage-remains-low/,2020-06-22T17:30:33-07:00,"
Three additional COVID-19 community outbreaks were reported today, bringing the region’s total to 10 over the past seven days. Also, more than 300 positive cases have been reported two days in a row.
The latest figures are concerning, County health officials say, and they will continue to monitor them closely to make sure they don’t become a trend.
“We expected that we would see more cases with the reopening,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “As we reopened, people are interacting more with each other and gathering in larger groups.”
Community outbreaks of COVID-19 are one of 13 triggers the County is closely monitoring to determine whether additional measures are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus.
This trigger stipulates that no more than seven outbreaks should be reported over the past seven days. Since the three new outbreaks occurred in three different types of settings and in different parts of the county, health officials said there is no need for more restrictive measures at this time.
However, the County is pausing on the reopening of additional sectors of the economy, even if the state releases new guidance, until it is safe to do it. Further actions also are possible.
“If we see that a trend is developing, we could take action and close entities, if necessary,” said Wooten, stressing that the County does not expect to shut down sectors of the economy but rather focus on affected businesses where outbreaks are identified.
While tracking case numbers is important, County health official said a better indicator is the 14-day average percentage of positive tests which, while slightly rising, continues to hover around 3%. The County will continue to monitor COVID-19 community outbreaks and cases to determine if a trend develops now that more sectors of the economy have reopened.
As the economy reopens and public gatherings increase, health officials stressed the need for San Diegans to continue following the local public health guidance.
They said San Diegans must do the following:

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if they are sick

“The virus remains alive and dangerous throughout our communities,” Wooten said. “We don’t want to reverse course. People should continue to take these precautions because they help to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
County employee Esma Al Sabag is doing contact tracing in English and Arabic.
COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths
Testing:

Of 5,831 tests reported to the County June 21, 5% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 2.9%.

Cases:

302 new cases in San Diego County residents for a total of 11,096.
1,627 or 14.7% of cases have required hospitalization.
451 or 4.1% of all cases and 27.7% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

No COVID-19 deaths were reported today. The countywide total remains at 338.

There are currently 59 active outbreaks in skilled nursing facilities and other congregate and community settings:

17 outbreaks with 622 cases, including 70 deaths in skilled nursing facilities.

Community outbreaks of COVID-19 continue to be a concern for the region since this “trigger” has remained in the red for the past seven days.
The County today announced eight community outbreaks have occurred in the past seven days. The outbreaks were identified in businesses, a campground, a social club, a restaurant, private homes and a federal facility.
COVID-19 community outbreaks are one of 13 metrics the County is monitoring that could trigger new restrictions. The measure stipulates that no more than seven new outbreaks can be reported over a seven-day period.  A community outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.
Also, 332 COVID-19 cases were reported June 23, a new record for the region and another indication that the virus continues to be widespread.
Given the number of COVID-19 community outbreaks being identified and the higher number of cases, the County has paused the reopening of additional sectors of the economy and won’t move forward, even if the state releases new guidance, until it is safe to do it.
Outbreak response
When a COVID-19 outbreak is connected to a business, such as a restaurant, it closes on its own to make sure all of its policies and procedures are being followed. Those include appropriate hygiene and sanitation, the use of face coverings, physical distancing and employee and customer health screenings.
“Most businesses are very responsible because they want to protect their employees and their customers,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
Public vigilance remains essential.
“It’s important for people to remember that the virus has not gone away,” Wooten said. “As more people interact with each other, the risk for exposure increases. People should stay home as much as possible.”
As more industries open up and San Diegans more frequently leave home, they must do the following to protect themselves and the public’s health:

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if they are sick

San Diegans are required to wear a facial covering while in public and close to other people.
COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths
Testing:

6,981 tests reported to the County June 23 and 5% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 3.1%.

Cases:

332 new cases in San Diego County residents for a total of 11,626.
1,661 or 14.3% of cases have required hospitalization.
456 or 3.9% of all cases and 27.5% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

Six more COVID-19 deaths were reported today, and the region’s total is now 347.
Four men and two women died between June 12 and June 22 and their ages ranged from 66 to 89 years.

For the third day in a row, the County’s Health and Human Services Agency is reporting record-high numbers of new COVID-19 infections. After four days of more than 300 new cases a day this week, the County is reporting 440 new cases today, bringing the total number to 12,401.
In addition to increasing case numbers, the County also met one of the 13 metrics officials are monitoring that could trigger new restrictions. The average number of hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection has increased by 19% in the last three days compared to the three days prior. The measure states the increase should not be greater than 10%.
Despite this metric being triggered, the local hospital systems still have capacity. The County will continue to monitor this and all other metrics closely to make sure the increases do not indicate a trend.
Health Officials Call for Vigilance
Given the increasing number of cases in the region and additional triggers being met, County health officials are urging San Diegans to remain vigilant.
“The spike in cases in recent days shows that the pandemic is far from over and we must all continue to do our part to keep infection numbers down,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This includes wearing a face covering when out in public, practicing good hand hygiene and staying home if you are sick.”
In addition, San Diegans should maintain social distancing and continue to keep six feet apart from those who are not members of the same household and avoid crowded places.
Young People More Impacted by COVID-19
San Diegans 20 to 29 years old are now 21% of cases, the highest of any 10-year age groups. More than half of the COVID-19 cases in the County are in people between 20 and 49 years old.
While young people, especially those who do not have any pre-existing conditions, are at a lower risk of experiencing the most severe outcomes of COVID-19, they are at a higher risk of contracting the virus.
“Younger individuals can infect older friends, relatives or colleagues even if they are not showing any symptoms of the virus,” Wooten said.

Testing:

6,824 tests were reported to the County June 25 and 6% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 3.4%.

Cases:

440 new cases in San Diego County residents for a total of 12,401.
1,706 or 13.8% of cases have required hospitalization.
466 or 3.8% of all cases and 27.3% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Six more COVID-19 deaths were reported today, and the region’s total is now 358.
Four men and two women died between June 13 and June 24 and their ages ranged from 57 to 95 years.

209,"Bars, Breweries, Wineries to Close Again in County","San Diego region bars, wineries and breweries without a license to serve food will need to close to prevent community outbreaks of COVID-19 and the spread of the virus, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/bars-breweries-wineries-to-close-again-in-county/,2020-06-29T18:15:29-07:00,"
San Diego region bars, wineries and breweries without a license to serve food will need to close to prevent community outbreaks of COVID-19 and the spread of the virus, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Starting July 1, these establishments must close their doors until further notice.
For those businesses with a food license, they can only serve food to customers seated at a table and alcohol can only be consumed while those patrons are eating.
The County will not consider further reopenings of any additional types of businesses or activities earlier than Aug. 1 to further slow the spread of COVID-19.
The decision was made given the number of outbreaks being identified in the region and the increasing number of cases and hospitalizations reported recently.
Nearly 500 cases of COVID-19 were reported in the County June 28, the highest total since the pandemic began.
Cases are being identified in a variety of settings, but recent outbreaks have been linked to bars, restaurants and private residences.
A growing number of cases are being identified in young people, especially those between the ages of 20 and 29. At the end of April, 15% of all cases reported were in people in that age range. Now, that percentage has increased to 22%.
“It’s obvious that more young people are going out and not following the public health guidance. That’s why we’re seeing more community outbreaks,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “They are going to bars, restaurants and having house parties and not wearing a mask or maintaining physical distance.”
Another group showing increasing percentages are those 10 to 19 years old. That percentage has risen from 2.4% in late April to almost 6% currently.

“People are going out in larger numbers and interacting with people outside their household,” Wooten said. “While younger people have less severe symptoms from COVID-19, it’s important to note that they could be spreading the virus to others who are more vulnerable.”
For people in their 30s, the percentage of positive cases has remained steady, and in older demographics the percentage has been steadily decreasing.
“Older people are heeding the public health advice and staying away from crowded places to avoid getting the virus,” Wooten said.

Your Actions Can Save Lives
The best way to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow the public health guidance being issued by state and local health officials.
“Our actions have power and can save lives,” Wooten said.
San Diegans must do the following to protect themselves and the public’s health and keep other sectors of the economy from being closed:

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if they are sick

COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths
Community Outbreaks:

In the past seven days, seven community outbreaks were identified; two new outbreaks were identified June 28 at two local restaurants.
The number of community outbreaks hits the trigger of seven in seven days.

Testing:

6,908 tests were reported to the County June 28 and 7% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 4.1%. 

Cases:

A record 498 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 13,832.
1,754 or 12.7% of cases have required hospitalization.
481 or 3.5% of all cases and 27.4% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

No new COVID-19 deaths were reported. The region’s total remains at 361.

210,San Diego Restaurants to Close Nightly at 10 PM,"San Diego restaurants must close nightly at 10 p.m. starting Wednesday, July 1 until further notice, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced Tuesday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-restaurants-to-close-nightly-at-10-pm/,2020-06-30T18:35:07-07:00,"
San Diego restaurants must close nightly at 10 p.m. starting Wednesday, July 1 until further notice, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced Tuesday.
Bars, wineries, distilleries and breweries that are allowed to serve food must also close nightly at 10 p.m. until 5 a.m.
The County is taking the action to prevent additional community outbreaks and the spread of COVID-19.
“In light of the high numbers of positive cases in recent days and reports today of 10 current community outbreaks throughout the County, a decision was made to close these establishments at 10 p.m.,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “As the night wears on, restaurants have a tendency to become bars and people are more likely to let their guard down when it comes to social distancing.”
Dr. Wooten emphasized the need to protect the public’s health as San Diego, the state and nation continue to see a jump in COVID-19 cases.
Locally, the number of positive cases climbed by 317 for a total of 14,149. The increase was not as steep as the previous day’s record high of 498. Current COVID-19-related cases in ICUs was at a record high of 182. Four new deaths were reported for a total of 365.
The largest contributors to the number of community outbreaks are bars and restaurants, and private residences. The following 10 outbreaks in community settings were confirmed during the last seven days.

With the increase of businesses and activities opened, people in the 20 to 29 age group are going out more and contributing to the higher number of cases.
With the Fourth of July holiday weekend coming up, San Diegans may want to celebrate with friends and family at backyard gatherings. However, the County is asking residents to continue to use caution and, if they must gather, stay with immediate family only for house parties and take all precautions.
If you do go out to dinner, wear a facial covering, maintain social distancing and frequently wash your hands.
The County is not closing beaches, but cities will have the final say. And County officials say those who go the beach should also take the same precautions.
Regional hospitals support the latest public health orders.
“It’s important to remember that the goal is to protect the health of the region and our community throughout the pandemic as well as preserve hospital capacity,” said Demetrios Alexiou, president and CEO of the Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties. “The recent trends that we’re seeing is putting that second item at risk. In the past week, we’ve seen hospitalizations go up from 300 or so to well over 400 now and there is no end in sight as those trends continue to go up.”
COVID-19 Tests, Cases and Deaths
Community Outbreaks:

In the past seven days, 10 community outbreaks were identified; four new outbreaks were identified June 29, one each at a grocery store, a restaurant, an animal clinic and a private residence.
The number of community outbreaks rises above the trigger of seven in seven days.

Testing:

7,382 tests were reported to the County June 29 and 4% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 4.2%. 

Cases:

317 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 14,149.
1,770 or 12.5% of cases have required hospitalization.
485 or 3.4% of all cases and 27.4% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

Four new COVID-19 deaths were reported bringing the region’s total to 365. Two males and two females died between June 13 and June 28. Their ages ranged from early 80s to early 90s and all four had underlying conditions.

211,"County Could Go on State Watch List, Adopt More Restrictions","Spread of the novel coronavirus has caused the County of San Diego to be flagged by the California Department of Public Health, positioning the region to go on the state’s Watch List and ultimately face new closures if the number of COVID-19 cases continues to go up.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-could-go-on-state-watch-list-adopt-more-restrictions/,2020-07-01T17:50:27-07:00,"
Spread of the novel coronavirus has caused the County of San Diego to be flagged by the California Department of Public Health, positioning the region to go on the state’s Watch List and ultimately face new closures if the number of COVID-19 cases continues to go up.
On June 30, the County was flagged because it surpassed the state’s trigger of no more than 100 positive cases per every 100,000 residents. On that day, the rate was 103.8 and rose to 105 July 1.
If the County has another day over that threshold, it will be placed the state’s Watch List on July 3 and monitored for an additional three days.
If the rate does not fall below 100 by July 6, then it would be required to adopt more restrictive measures and close indoor activities for three weeks at:

Restaurants
Bars, breweries and wineries
Movie theaters, family entertainment centers and cardrooms
Museums and zoos

“If things don’t improve, we will be forced to take these additional measures,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We all should be wearing a face covering, staying away from others and taking other preventative measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
Masks, Distance Prevent Spread
The best way to prevent getting COVID-19 is to follow the public health guidance being issued by state and local health officials.
“When people don’t follow the health guidance, they could be putting their lives and the lives of others in danger,” Wooten said.
San Diegans must do the following to protect themselves and the public’s health and keep other sectors of the economy from being closed:

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if they are sick

No Fourth of July Gatherings
The state, which is the entity issuing guidance on loosening public health restrictions, announced that Fourth of July fireworks are allowed but gatherings are not.
Also, outdoor picnics and barbecues can occur but only with household members, and they should take place at home or close to home.
When outside the home, people should always wear a face covering and maintain physical distancing from others.
Local beaches will remain open for the 4th of July weekend. However, the state announced it will be closing parking lots at state beaches.
Locally, cities will determine whether to close or limit parking at their beach lots.

213,County Expands Coronavirus Testing Locations; Limited Holiday Schedule,"The County of San Diego is expanding free COVID-19 testing, with a new site now open in National City and the Tubman-Chavez Community Center being the region’s first County-operated, no-appointment, coronavirus testing location.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-expands-coronavirus-testing-locations-limited-holiday-schedule/,2020-07-02T13:35:18-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is expanding free COVID-19 testing, with a new site now open in National City and the Tubman-Chavez Community Center being the region’s first County-operated, no-appointment, coronavirus testing location.
Open seven days a week (July 4 excepted), people seeking tests should arrive between 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at Tubman-Chavez, 415 Euclid Avenue, where they will walk in to receive a free, zero-copay test conducted by a County nurse. Tests take 5-10 minutes, wait times will vary and testing is limited to 150 people per day.
In National City, the state testing site that used to be run from Tubman-Chavez has been relocated to the Kimball Senior Center, 1221 D Avenue. It will be open Monday to Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Advance appointments are required.
“Testing people, particularly in areas with high numbers of COVID-19 cases, is a critical part of our public health efforts to contain the pandemic until we have a vaccine,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “By identifying people who are positive, we can get them into isolation, and help prevent the spread of the virus.”
COVID-19 tests are used to evaluate your health for COVID-19 infection and help public health agencies control the virus’s spread. Testing also helps identify specific areas and groups with higher rates of infection. Understanding these patterns is important to protect the public’s health and continue safely reopening the County.
Testing will be limited over the Fourth of July weekend. See schedule. You can also visit 211sandiego.org.
If you feel you are experiencing symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, or shortness of breath, contact your health care provider. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1. If you have serious symptoms, like difficulty breathing, call 9-1-1.
Health plans are required to cover COVID-19 tests at no cost to the enrollee, even if you are asymptomatic. It is recommended that you first contact your health care provider for a COVID-19 test.
If you are unable to get a test from your health care provider, the County has coordinated free diagnostic COVID-19 testing at many locations.
Appointments are required (except at Tubman-Chavez Center). To make an appointment online, visit 211sandiego.org or call 2-1-1 (toll free). Appointments can be made up to one week in advance.

214,4 Wild Mice Collected in Campo Area Test Positive for Hantavirus,"County officials are reminding people they should never sweep or vacuum up after rodents if they find them in living spaces like homes, garages, sheds and cabins, after four wild mice collected in routine monitoring tested positive for hantavirus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/4-wild-mice-collected-in-campo-area-test-positive-for-hantavirus/,2020-07-02T15:25:25-07:00,"
Four wild mice collected in routine monitoring in open space in the Campo area have tested positive for hantavirus.
County officials are reminding people they should never sweep or vacuum up after rodents if they find them in living spaces like homes, garages, sheds and cabins, but instead use “wet-cleaning” methods.
Hantavirus is potentially deadly, and people are exposed to it when the virus, shed by wild rodents in urine, feces and saliva, dries, is stirred into the air and inhaled. There is no cure or vaccine for the virus.
Hantavirus is not uncommon in San Diego County. The four wild mice collected in Campo brought the number of rodents testing positive for hantavirus this year around the county to 22.
Even so, people are unlikely to be exposed to the virus because the viruses’ carriers, wild rodents, wild mice in particular, generally want to live and nest away from people.
Still, County officials said people should be careful to use wet cleaning methods, with bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags if they find rodent droppings or other signs that wild rodents have gotten into living spaces and they must clean.
The mice collected in the open space in Campo included two California mice, one deer mouse, and one brush mouse.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

For more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health (DEH) at (858) 694-2888 or visit the DEH hantavirus web page.

215,County to Be Placed on Watchlist; Impacted Businesses Should Prepare,"A record number of COVID-19 cases were reported today, and the state has notified the County it will be placed on its Monitoring List July 3, which is expected to result in the County closing or placing new restrictions on additional businesses next week.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-be-placed-on-watchlist-impacted-businesses-should-prepare/,2020-07-02T15:30:08-07:00,"
A record number of COVID-19 cases were reported today, and the state has notified the County it will be placed on its Monitoring List July 3, which is expected to result in the County closing or placing new restrictions on additional businesses next week.
In the past three days, the rate of COVID-19 cases in the region went up from 103.8 to 112.8, surpassing the state’s threshold of no more than 100 cases per every 100,000 residents. Here’s how the rate is calculated.
Given the continuing high number of daily cases, it is expected that the County will be on the state’s watchlist for the next three days and it could be forced to mandate more restrictive measures and additional closings based on guidance from the state.
Businesses on the state’s list should prepare to close or modify their operations since new restrictions could be effective as early as July 7 and would last for three weeks.
Indoor activities could be restricted on the following businesses:

Dine-in restaurants (outdoor, pick up or drive-through can occur)
Wineries and tasting rooms
Movie theaters, family entertainment centers and cardrooms
Museums and zoos

Celebrate Fourth of July Safely
As residents prepare to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday, they should do it safely by not gathering in groups and staying with people in their own household.
Outdoor picnics and barbecues should take place only  with household members to prevent the spread of the virus, and they should take place at home or close to home
When outside the home, San Diegans should do the following to protect themselves and others:

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if they are sick

COVID-19 Triggers, Tests, Cases and Deaths
Community Outbreaks and Other Triggers:
The County is monitoring 13 measures, or triggers, that could prompt revisions to the health order.

10 new outbreaks were reported July 2: eight in restaurants/bars, one in a grocery and one in a business.
In the past seven days, 22 community outbreaks were identified which represent 100 laboratory-confirmed cases.
The number of community outbreaks far exceeds the seven in seven days trigger.
A community outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.
The County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 67% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.

Testing:


8,510 tests were reported to the County July 1 and 7% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 4.9%. 

Cases:

A record 584 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 15,207.
1,821 or 12% of cases have required hospitalization.
497 or 3.3% of all cases and 27.3% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

216,"Dine-In Restaurants, Other Indoor Activities to Close in County","Indoor dining at restaurants, bars, breweries and wineries will close July 7 for at least three weeks, after the County remained on the state’s Monitoring List for three consecutive days due to the region’s high number of COVID-19 cases.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/dine-in-restaurants-other-indoor-activities-to-close-in-county/,2020-07-06T18:50:50-07:00,"
Indoor dining at restaurants, bars, breweries and wineries will close July 7 for at least three weeks, after the County remained on the state’s Monitoring List for three consecutive days due to the region’s high number of COVID-19 cases.
Outdoor/patio dining today is still permitted until 10 p.m., but patrons must leave the premises by 11 p.m. Also, pickup, delivery and drive-thru can still occur.
State guidance requires that indoor activities be closed in the 23 counties in the state that have more than 100 COVID-19 cases per every 100,000 residents in a 14-day period, after being on California’s watchlist for three days.
In the past three days, the rate of COVID-19 cases in San Diego County using the state’s formula is now at 136.1.
“This metric has been abnormal for several days,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer, adding that it coincides with more outbreaks in community settings, especially in restaurants and bars. “This supports the actions we are taking today and that are being imposed upon us.”
Indoor activities also will be restricted at movie theaters, family entertainment centers such as bowling alleys and batting cages, as well as museums, zoos and cardrooms.
Indoor activities will be restricted for at least three weeks, a requirement the state implemented to slow the spread of COVID-19. If the rate of infection for the region does not fall below 100, the period of restrictions could be extended unless the state issues new guidance.
More Young People Getting Infected
In recent weeks, the percentage of cases in people between 20 and 39 years old has been increasing compared to other age groups. Currently, they represent about 50% of the cases being reported.
“The surge in cases is occurring in these age groups because they are less likely to wear a face covering and maintain physical distance,” Wooten said.
When outside the home, San Diegans should do the following to protect themselves and others:

Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Keep six feet apart
Wear a face covering
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if they are sick

Local small businesses and restaurants suffering financial losses due to COVID-19 can now apply for a grant from the County of San Diego.
The Board of Supervisors approved a new Small Business Stimulus Program Tuesday during a Board meeting that also included a report on the behavioral health aspects of COVID-19.
Small Business Stimulus Program
For-profit and nonprofit businesses can apply for grant money if they can show losses and costs are a direct result of the pandemic.
To qualify businesses must have:

100 or fewer employees
Headquarters in San Diego County
A minimum 1-year operating history as of Feb. 14, 2020
Documentation of financial hardship because of COVID-19

Board supervisors had approved using $17 million in CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Fund funds last May to help restaurants and small businesses. Tuesday, the supervisors approved the implementation of the program.
Businesses are urged to apply early. Applications are available now through Oct. 16 – subject to available funding.
For more information and the application, visit the stimulus website.
COVID-19 Behavioral Health  
Behavioral health experts across the country are monitoring the effects of the COVID-19 health crisis and accompanying economic slowdown, especially the rates of suicide and drug overdose deaths.
Nationwide, surveys show a 200% increase in psychological distress compared to a comparable period last year due to COVID-19.
Locally, the County of San Diego is reviewing statistics on the psychological impacts of COVID-19.
“The data, rigorously collected and reviewed by our County Medical Examiner, are clear: suicide rates are static, and if anything, are trending downward,” said Luke Bergmann, Behavioral Health Services Director. “This doesn’t mean that we won’t see that trendline change. Suicide rates almost always increase with bad economic times; we will have to remain vigilant about suicide risk.”
Data shows the trend in accidental drug overdose deaths is going up. Bergmann says there was a 40% reduction in the use of the substance use disorder treatment system.
COVID-19 Update
Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten updated the Board on the COVID-19 situation in the County. Due to the region’s high number of COVID-19 cases, the County is now on the State’s Watch List for at least three weeks. As of midnight last night, San Diego County was required to close indoor activities at:

Restaurants and bars
Wineries and tasting rooms
Zoos and museums

218,COVID-19 Community Setting Outbreaks Continue to Be Confirmed in County,"Outbreaks of COVID-19 in community settings continue to pop up throughout the region, prompting County health officials to remind San Diegans to take precautions to slow the spread of the virus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-community-setting-outbreaks-continue-to-be-confirmed-in-county/,2020-07-08T18:05:38-07:00,"
Outbreaks of COVID-19 in community settings continue to pop up throughout the region, prompting County health officials to remind San Diegans to take precautions to slow the spread of the virus.
Five new community outbreaks were confirmed July 7, bringing the seven-day total to 24, the highest number over the seven-day period. The new outbreaks represent 137 cases, but since the outbreaks are still active, the figure might increase.
An outbreak in a community setting is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in people of different households. One of the County’s “triggers,” or metrics that could lead to additional restrictions, is that there be no more than seven outbreaks over a seven-day period. That measure has been mostly in the red since it was hit June 17.
“Community outbreaks occur when people don’t follow the public health guidance,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We can’t be complacent and think that we can go back to living our lives before COVID-19. The pandemic is not over. The virus is still here.”
A lower number of COVID-19 community setting outbreaks was being reported at the beginning of the pandemic. During the first three months of the pandemic, 27 outbreaks were reported in the region.
More community outbreaks began to be confirmed as the economy reopened. Thirty-four outbreaks were reported in June, and 23 during the first week of July.
The great majority of community outbreaks have been reported in restaurants with bars. The County Department of Environmental Health continues to work with restaurants to make sure they are following the public health guidelines. County strike teams will soon be deployed to other businesses and worksites where outbreaks are confirmed.
County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to follow the public health guidance to protect themselves and others. People should:

Wear a face covering
Keep six feet apart
Practice good hand hygiene and sanitation
Not have house parties or gatherings
Stay home if they are sick

“When people gather at home, they tend to put their guard down because they are with family and friends,” Wooten said. “If they follow the guidance given, we can help slow the spread of COVID-19 and can save lives.”
COVID-19 Triggers, Tests, Cases and Deaths
Community Setting Outbreaks and Other Triggers:

The five new outbreaks were confirmed in a restaurant, a healthcare setting, a gym, a day care and a resort/spa.
In the past seven days, 24 community setting outbreaks were identified.
The number of new outbreaks in community settings is above the trigger of seven in seven days.
The County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 64% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.
The state’s threshold of no more than 100 cases per every 100,000 residents is also in the red and currently registers at 135.9 in San Diego County.

Testing:

7,607 tests were reported to the County July 7 and 3% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 5.8%.
The 7-day daily average of tests is 7,434.

Cases:

264 were reported July 7 in San Diego County for a total of 17,842.
1,961 or 11.0% of cases have required hospitalization.
524 or 3% of all cases and 26.7% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

Seven new COVID-19 deaths were reported July 7, and the region’s total is now at 406.
Seven women died between July 2 and July 6, and their ages ranged from 66-91 years.
All had underlying medical conditions.

221,Tuberculosis Case Reported at Patrick Henry High School,A person at Patrick Henry High School was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed students and staff according to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-case-reported-at-patrick-henry-high-school/,2020-07-13T11:44:38-07:00,"
A person at Patrick Henry High School was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed students and staff according to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA).
The dates of exposure are from August 26, 2019 to March 13, 2020. HHSA is working with San Diego Unified School District officials to notify those who were potentially exposed and provide TB testing.
Patrick Henry High School is currently participating in social distancing protocols and onsite TB screening will not be available at the school. Students identified to have been exposed to TB can get tested with their primary care provider. Students who do not have a medical provider may contact HHSA staff to arrange for free testing by appointment only. Identified staff will be provided testing by the San Diego Unified School District.
Tuberculosis is transmitted from person to person through indoor air during prolonged contact with an infectious person. Most people who are exposed do not become infected.
“Testing is recommended for everyone who was determined to have been exposed to make sure they are not infected since initial infection typically has no symptoms,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Early diagnosis is important so that people can get treatment and prevent them from developing the infectious form of the disease.”
Symptoms of infectious tuberculosis include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss. People with symptoms of TB, or who are immune-compromised and may not show symptoms, should consult their medical provider to be evaluated for the bacteria. Tuberculosis can be cured with antibiotics.
People who would like more information on this potential exposure should contact:

Patrick Henry High School at:

sdusdnursing@sandi.net
(619) 725-5501


County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621

Tuberculosis in not uncommon in the San Diego region but has been decreasing since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years.
There were 237 tuberculosis cases reported in 2017 and 226 in 2018. Last year, 265 San Diego County residents were diagnosed with TB. To date, 67 cases have been reported in 2020.

222,Smoke from Ship Fire Could Be Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups,The County Air Pollution Control District is monitoring the air quality in San Diego due to the fire on the USS Bonhomme Richard at Naval Base San Diego.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/smoke-from-ship-fire-could-be-unhealthy-for-sensitive-groups/,2020-07-13T12:46:52-07:00,"
Editor’s Note: To assist residents seeking relief from smoke from the USS BonHomme Richard fire, the County extended the hours at its Spring Valley cool zone at the Spring Valley Community Center starting Monday. The Spring Valley cool zone will be open from noon to 8 p.m. from Monday, July 13 to Thursday July 16.
The County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) is monitoring the air quality in San Diego due to the fire on the USS Bonhomme Richard at Naval Base San Diego.
While localized smoke has occurred in some areas of San Diego, the air quality has been and continues to be good for the public in most areas of the region, depending on location and wind patterns, but could be unhealthy for sensitive groups. The elderly, children, and people with lung and heart disease are vulnerable to the effects of smoke.
“Right now, we’re not seeing anything rise to a level of health concerns for the public. However, where smoke is present, San Diegans should limit physical activity and stay indoors, if possible, to limit exposure to particulate matter,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The situation could change as the fire is expected to be burning for a few days.”
In areas with heavy smoke, San Diegans should assume the air quality levels are unhealthy for sensitive groups and could be unhealthy for the public. In areas with minor smoke impacts, the air quality levels are likely to be moderate to unhealthy for sensitive groups.
“APCD is working closely with County Public Health Services and the Department of Environmental Health, as well as the Navy, and will continue monitoring air quality in the region and advise the public if conditions change,” said Rob Reider, director of County Air Pollution Control District.
APCD has three stationary monitors in the community that evaluate conditions. The Navy has also been monitoring air quality in the area and found zero levels of volatile organic compounds.

223,"County to Close Indoor Operations at Gyms, Nail Salons and Other Sectors","Following new state guidance, the County will be closing indoor operations for certain sectors effective July 15.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-close-indoor-operations-at-gyms-nail-salons-and-other-sectors/,2020-07-13T17:05:08-07:00,"
Following new state guidance, the County will be closing indoor operations for certain sectors effective July 15.
They include:

Gyms and fitness centers
Places of worship
Personal care services, including nail salons and massage and tattoo parlors
Hair salons and barbershops
Indoor malls
Offices for non-essential sectors

These closures will remain in effect until further notice.
The additional actions are being taken due to the rising number of cases across state and the County, which could overwhelm the healthcare system.
“We have been seeing an increasing number of cases and we need to take further action now,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We’re following state guidance to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19.”
Outdoor operations can occur under a tent, canopy or other sun shelter but only if the sides are not closed and there is sufficient outdoor air movement.
COVID-19 Testing to Focus on Priority Groups
As the amount of novel coronavirus testing supplies is dwindling across the nation, state and the region, the County will be focusing its testing efforts on people who need it the most.
The highest priority for the County remains to test those with symptoms or people in high-risk groups that may include:

Healthcare workers, first responders, other social service employees and people in essential jobs
Older adults
People with chronic medical conditions
People living in a residential or group setting, such as a long-term care facility or shelter
People exposed to infected individuals in places where COVID-19 risk is high

Today, the County also announced a new partnership with Helix, a San Diego company, to expand access to COVID-19 testing.
This public-private partnership will give San Diego County access to up to 2,000 COVID-19 tests per day with results returned in 24 to 48 hours.
Founded in 2015, Helix is a population genomics company in San Diego. Since the start of the pandemic, it has shifted the majority of its resources to support COVID-19 testing and now operates one of the nation’s highest throughput COVID-19 testing labs.
People who want to get a COVID-19 test should contact their healthcare provider. San Diegans without one should call 2-1-1 to get a referral. For more information on testing, visit www.211sandiego.org or call 2-1-1.

Community Setting Outbreaks and Other Triggers:

No new community setting outbreaks were identified on July 12.
In the past seven days, 17 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains more than double the trigger of seven or more in seven days.

The County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 60% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.
The state’s threshold of no more than 100 cases per every 100,000 residents is also in the red and currently registers at 137 in San Diego County.

224,"More Young San Diegans Getting Sick, Hospitalized Due to COVID-19","The number of younger San Diegans getting infected with the novel coronavirus has been increasing in recent weeks, and more of them are landing in the hospital, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/more-young-san-diegans-getting-sick-hospitalized-due-to-covid-19/,2020-07-15T17:47:32-07:00,"
The number of younger San Diegans getting infected with the novel coronavirus has been increasing in recent weeks, and more of them are landing in the hospital, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
Of the nearly 21,500 COVID-19 cases reported in the region, San Diegans between 20 and 39 years of age represent nearly 44% of all cases.
A closer look at the HHSA data shows that after restaurants, bars, wineries, breweries, hotels and other businesses reopened, the number of people between 20 and 39 years of age getting sick with COVID-19 began to rise rapidly.

During the second week of June, 510 San Diegans in that age bracket got sick with COVID-19. Another 1,144 got sick the following week, and during the last week of June the number jumped to 1,595. The figures began to decrease again when indoor activities at those same were closed again. The total was down to 1,028 by the week ending July 11.
“Some young people think they’re invincible and won’t get sick, but that’s not the case,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Not only are they getting sick, but they are also ending up at emergency rooms and needing hospitalization.”
During the second week of June 10, a total of 16 San Diegans between 20 and 39 years of age were hospitalized. The figured dropped to 12 the following week and jumped to 27 the last week of June. Again, the number began to decrease when certain sectors of the economy were closed and was down to 18 by July 11.
Also, the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in community settings followed a similar pattern of increasing as activities widened. While only eight community outbreaks were reported in May, in June, 33 were identified. This month, 38 community outbreaks have been reported, with restaurants/bars and private residences the most common locations.
“The evidence is clear. As more people started to go out, especially young people, we started to see an increasing number of COVID-19 cases,” Wooten said.
COVID-19 Impact in Younger People
Dr. Scott Eisman, a pulmonary disease and critical care medicine expert at Scripps Memorial Hospital in Encinitas, said that while young people think COVID-19 is not serious, the novel coronavirus could have serious health issues, especially in young people who smoke or vape.
“Many younger people think that this is something that you’ll get, and you’ll overcome, and everything will be fine, but the complications of this illness are greater than the flu,” Eisman said. “We have younger and younger patients showing up with more and more significant complications.”
Eisman said research has shown that COVID-19 attacks both lungs and their blood vessels which could result in blood clotting in the lungs and other parts of the body.
COVID-19, Eisman said, can cause other problems, including stroke, cardiac issues, cerebral dysfunction, liver and kidney failure.
“It causes blood clotting in general and that could create substantial problems in the ability of the lung to deliver oxygen,” Eisman said.
County Hiring Case Investigators
Due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, the County is hiring additional people to do case investigations, an important activity in public health responses to infectious disease.
Case investigators call or email people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to ask them to isolate themselves and find out their close contacts. Bilingual applicants are encouraged to apply for the temporary position.
The new hires will join the more than 510 case investigators and contact tracers currently working to stop the spread of the virus.
Community Setting Outbreaks and Other Triggers:

Four new community setting outbreaks were identified on July 14 in a hair salon, a barbershop, a restaurant/bar and a laboratory.
In the past seven days, 14 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks is double the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.
The County also reached the Case Investigation trigger because only 46% of investigations were initiated within 24 hours of notification over a 7-day period. The percentage should be at least 71%.
The state’s threshold of no more than 100 cases per every 100,000 residents is also in the red and currently registers at 147.2 in San Diego County.

Testing:

8,436 tests were reported to the County on July 14 and 7% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 6.3%. The target set by the state is less than 8%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 8,056.

Cases:

559 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 21,446.
2,093 or 9.8% of cases have required hospitalization.
546 or 2.5% of all cases and 26.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

 Deaths:

12 new COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County on July 14, and the region’s total is now 448.
Seven men and five women died between July 5 and July 14 and their ages ranged from mid-50s to mid-90s.

227,"Pandemic, Economic Crises Impact New County Budget","COVID-19, the economic crisis and worldwide calls for social justice and racial equality – events impacting nearly every one of us are also transforming the County’s new budget. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/pandemic-economic-crises-impact-new-county-budget/,2020-07-20T12:29:58-07:00,"
COVID-19, the economic crisis and worldwide calls for social justice and racial equality – events impacting nearly every one of us are also transforming the County’s new budget.   
The recommended $6.4 billion budget for fiscal year 2020-21 was released Monday, July 20.  
The total shows an increase of $159 million or 2.5% over last year and includes $100 million to fight the COVID-19 public health crisis. The recommended budget also calls for dipping into the County’s reserves.  
The pandemic coupled with the economic downturn are slashing revenue at a time when costs are rapidly rising. Despite these challenges, the County is required by law to balance the budget.  
To address major revenue shortfalls and expenditure needs, the County’s budget strategy relies on spending available one-time funds from the County’s General Fund reserves and from balances outside of the General Fund while also slowing down or stopping non-essential services and projects.  
The County’s top budgetary priority is battling COVID-19. The Health and Human Services Agency will see an increase of $100 million to reduce the pandemic’s spread and allow for responsible reopening. The funding will go toward efforts tied to responding to COVID-19, including the Testing, Tracing and Treatment Strategy (T3), food distribution, medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and shelter.  
Another $15 million will pay for technology needs to support behavioral health services, including: telehealth, electronic health record upgrades, outreach and engagement, workforce recruitment and retention. 
The County is also providing a wide array of online services to customers that range from help for behavioral health issues, to permitting, to digital library books. Parks is offering virtual programs as well, including Movies in the Park. 
The Registrar of Voters office is busy planning for the November presidential election but this time, needs to ensure it is conducted in the safest way possible during this pandemic.   
While COVID-19 appears to overshadow many aspects of our lives, the County is still supporting vulnerable people. 
To strengthen children and families, the County will continue to serve over 1 million San Diegans every month with Medi-Cal, CalFresh, CalWORKs and General Relief, and also help enroll low income families and others affected by the pandemic’s economic fallout. Child Welfare Services will expand upon efforts to strengthen families and address disproportionality and disparities. Seniors will be supported through efforts such as the Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation program and Alzheimer’s awareness.  
A $23.7 million increase will address homelessness in the unincorporated area and another $0.4 million will be used to develop a Flexible Housing Subsidy Pool in collaboration with the Regional Task Force on the Homeless to help move those experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.  
A $3 million increase will help address homelessness among youth up to the age of 24, with a focus on youth transitioning from foster care and young parents experiencing homelessness. The Sheriff’s Homeless Assistance Resource Team (HART) will see a $2.6 million increase to expand its program.  
In the area of behavioral health, the County continues to transform the multi-sectoral system of care from one driven by crisis, to one of continuous care and prevention, by providing coordinated resources to keep people connected, stable and healthy. This includes increased investments for diversionary services, such as the expansion of Crisis Stabilization Units, and increases to help community providers expand their capacity for long–term treatment. The County will also continue its partnership with UC San Diego Health to develop a behavioral health hub on County-owned property in Hillcrest.   
Nationwide conversations are driving change in public safety. De-escalation training for law enforcement agencies is a priority to strengthen community trust, equity and racial justice. By the end of the year, nearly 3,000 officers are expected to complete training through the District Attorney’s office, with an additional 1,600 through the Sheriff’s Department. The Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board will have increased authority and expanded resources to provide independent oversight of the Sheriff’s Department and Probation. 
The Board of Supervisors created a new Office of Equity and Racial Justice to examine bias within the County organization, which will also work with the newly formed Human Relations Commission. The Commission will collaborate with community organizations to address disparities and create more equitable programs, services and resources for all. 
Plans are in the works to create the District Attorney North County Family Justice Center to further protect victims of crime. The County is also designing an earthquake early warning system pilot program and building two fire stations, one in Mt. Laguna and the other at Palomar Mountain.   
The County is on track to nearly double the number of affordable housing units in its portfolio over five years to help low income, special needs and homeless residents using local, state and federal funds. Pre-approved plans, permit and impact fee waivers are available for the construction of granny flats or accessory dwelling units to help ease the affordable housing shortage.  
The budget includes funds to protect and improve the region’s air quality, including $5.0 million for addressing vehicle emissions and $21.1 million to implement the Community Air Protection Program that continues to monitor air quality in communities most vulnerable to air pollution.

228,What San Diegans Need to Do for County to Get Off State Watchlist,What does San Diego County need to do to get off the state's watchlist? The answer is in San Diegans’ hands.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/what-san-diegans-need-to-do-for-county-to-get-off-state-watchlist/,2020-07-20T17:26:33-07:00,"
On July 3, the County was placed on the state’s Monitoring List after the region’s case rate went above 100 positive cases per every 100,000 people three days in a row.
The County has not met that metric since then, and the case rate stands now at 145.3.
What does San Diego County need to do to get off the watchlist? The answer is in San Diegans’ hands.
Local health officials continue to urge San Diegans to wear a face covering, avoid gatherings, maintain six feet distance from anyone outside their household, wash their hands thoroughly, and take other preventive measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent community outbreaks.

“We hope that the actions we’ve taken in the past few weeks will help us flatten the curve and bring the number of cases down,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “With your help, we expect cases will decrease.”

After the County lowers its case rate to the state’s metric for at least three days, it comes off the Monitoring List. If that does not occur, the County will be barred from opening more sectors of the economy, and schools will not be able to open for in-person instruction.
The County has its own set of indicators, or “triggers,” it is tracking that could prompt changes to the health order. On June 30, the County reached the Case Investigation trigger because the percentage of investigations initiated within 24 hours of notification over a seven-day period fell below 71%. The percentage has decreased dramatically since then. On July 19, the trigger was at 8%. However, the percentage of investigations increases to nearly 60 percent after 72 hours and is likely to improve with the addition of more case investigators.
This week, the County is adding nearly 100 new case investigators to contact San Diegans who have tested positive and identify who their close contacts were. The new hires will join the more than 520 case investigators and contact tracers currently working to slow the pandemic.
Going forward, the County will also be hiring approximately 200 case investigators from the more than 2,300 job applications that were submitted in the last few days. The position closes at midnight July 20.
Community Outbreaks Increasing
The number of COVID-19 outbreaks in community settings continue to jump throughout the region. It has increased steadily in July.
So far this month, 47 outbreaks have been reported in community settings, already surpassing the 33 that were reported in June and the 27 that were confirmed during the first three months of the pandemic.
Restaurants with bars account for the great majority of community outbreaks confirmed this month. The County Department of Environmental Health continues to work with restaurants to make sure they are following the public health guidelines. County strike teams are being deployed to businesses and other sites where outbreaks are confirmed and to make sure they are following state and local guidance.
Through July 19, a total of 107 COVID-19 community outbreaks have been confirmed in San Diego County.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

No new outbreaks were identified on July 19.
In the past seven days, 16 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.

Testing:

7,884 tests were reported to the County on July 16 and 5.7% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive tests is 6.1%. Target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 8,922.

Cases: 

453 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 24,135.
2,215 or 9.2% of cases have required hospitalization.
575 or 2.4% of all cases and 26% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

No COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County on July 19. The region’s total remains at 478.

229,County Intensifying COVID-19 Outreach to Latino Communities,The County is intensifying its outreach efforts to Latinos across the region because they are carrying a bigger burden of COVID-19 compared to other groups.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-intensifying-covid-19-outreach-to-latino-communities/,2020-07-21T10:31:38-07:00,"
The County is intensifying its outreach efforts to Latinos across the region because they are carrying a bigger burden of COVID-19 compared to other groups.
County health officials are greatly concerned about the disproportionate impact the virus is having in Latino communities. They are responding to this health inequity by ramping up education and outreach to help address systemic barriers that are contributing to Latinos being more severely impacted by COVID-19.
The County has launched a new TV, radio, online and signage campaign describing protective measures and community resources. The campaign, which will include an emphasis on a youth audience, started this week.
Digital ads in Spanish and English will start running this week.
The campaign comes on the heels of commercials on three of the most listened-to Spanish radio stations in the region. The two ads encouraged Latinos to get tested for the novel coronavirus and to answer the call when a County disease investigator or contact tracer calls them.

“It’s important that we continue to encourage Latinos and all San Diegans to take preventive measures to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We all have a role to play to protect ourselves and others, especially people who are more vulnerable to the virus.”

Dr. Wilma Wooten, County Public Health Officer.
The two campaigns supplement existing County outreach efforts that have been running since early in the pandemic when it became apparent through data that the virus was disproportionately impacting Latinos and other communities of color.
Since the beginning the County has made outreach materials in English and Spanish, as well as multiple other languages. The County’s initial public awareness campaign also included TV, radio and online ads in Spanish and focused on getting San Diegans to, first, stay at home and later to stay healthy by wearing a face covering, maintaining physical distance and continuing taking other preventative measures.
The County coronavirus site, www.coronavirus-sd.com, has a Spanish translation feature, as well as the County News Center website where all of the updates and actions from local health officials are being published.
Through an agreement with the local Univision affiliate, the County’s media briefings are being interpreted live into Spanish. You can watch them online.
Latinos and COVID-19
Since the beginning of the pandemic, it became clear the novel coronavirus was having a more severe impact among Latinos, especially in South Bay communities.

To date, of the more than 24,000 COVID-19 cases with known race/ethnicity, about 60% are Hispanics. Latinos make up about 34% of the local population.

County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) data also shows the case rate for Latinos is about 1,045 people per every 100,000 residents. The only other group with a higher infection rate is Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders with about 1,146 people testing positive per every 100,000 residents. Next are Black or African Americans with a rate of 522.
In comparison, white San Diegans have case rate of about 320 per 100,000 and represent 38% of all the cases.
More COVID-19 deaths are also being reported in the Latino community. Of the nearly 480 deaths, about 45% were Latinos. They are followed by whites at about 38% and Asians with 12%.
The County and its partners are examining the reasons for the disproportionality. One of the reasons supported by data from the San Diego Association of Governments points to Latinos being more likely to occupy high-contact professions such as essential or frontline workers who have continued to work during the pandemic and do not have the option of working remotely. Other reasons include broader social determinants of health that play out not only with COVID-19 outcomes but across other health outcomes.
Testing, Tracing and Treating
To slow the spread of the virus, the County has expanded testing throughout the region, especially in the South Bay. Currently, more than 50% of all testing is being done in this region.
The County opened its newest COVID-19 testing site in Imperial Beach last week. This new location brings the total number to six testing sites in South County and is part of the County’s South Bay Saturation strategy. Additional testing sites are located in San Ysidro, Chula Vista (two) and National City (two).
Barbara Jimenez is joined by HHSA Director Nick Macchione at the launch of a testing site in Imperial Beach.
The County has also increased its contact tracing capabilities and now has more than 500 disease investigators and contact tracers who are calling people who tested positive for COVID-19 and their close contacts so that they place themselves in isolation or self-quarantine. Nearly 100 more case investigators will come on board this week and the County will be hiring another 200 from the more than 2,300 job applications it recently received.
In collaboration with San Diego State University, the County is deploying about 100 specially trained community health workers and public health students as tracers under the promotora model. They will help perform contact tracing in underserved communities.
Tracers provide information, monitor the health of close contacts of positive cases and encourage them to seek care if they develop severe symptoms such as difficulty breathing.
The County has also been working with community and faith organizations, as well as regional elected officials, to share information on testing, tracing and treatment resources that is available in our county.

“We’ve not only expanded our testing, but we’ve also increased our contact tracing in the region,” said Barbara Jiménez, director for the Central and South regions of the County Health and Human Services Agency.

Jiménez has been spearheading the County’s outreach efforts in South Bay communities and has been working with city mayors and many other partners to get prevention, testing and tracing messages to area residents.
“We all need to follow the health prevention messages we’ve been promoting on preventing the spread of COVID-19. Let’s take care of ourselves, our families and our community,” Jiménez said.
San Diegans wishing to get a COVID-19 test can do it by calling their healthcare provider, especially if they have symptoms. People without a medical provider can call 2-1-1 to get a reference.
Testing appointments can be made by calling 2-1-1 or online at 211sandiego.org.

230,"County COVID-19 Deaths Surpass 500, Cases Over 25K","A record number of COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego, bringing the region’s total to 505, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-covid-19-deaths-surpass-500-cases-over-25k/,2020-07-22T18:22:30-07:00,"
A record number of COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego, bringing the region’s total to 505, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Eighteen San Diegans died between June 22 and July 21, and their ages ranged from 51 to 96 years. All had existing medical conditions.
Also, 587 COVID-19 cases were reported July 21, the third highest one-day total. To date, 25,107 cases have been reported in San Diego County.
Throughout the pandemic, San Diegans over 50 years of age have been hit hardest by COVID-19. While people in this demographic represent only 31% of the more than 25,000 cases, they account for nearly 96% of the deaths.
COVID-19 has been most deadly for San Diegans 60 years and older. People in this age group represent only 17% of the cases but 87% of the deaths.
“Getting through this pandemic requires that we all do our part to protect ourselves and others,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We are depending on everyone. Every individual, every business, every school and all other sectors to play a role and protect our most vulnerable.”
The disproportionate number of deaths among older people is the fact that nearly all of them had underlying medical conditions such as heart and lung disease, cancer, diabetes or obesity.
More COVID-19 Deaths Being Reported Outside Congregate Settings
At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of the deaths were being reported in skilled-nursing facilities and other congregate settings.
Today, more deaths are being reported in the general population. Of the 505 COVID-19 deaths, 291 or 58% are among the general population compared to 214 or 42% that have been reported in skilled-nursing facilities and other congregate settings.
“The increasing number of deaths outside of congregate facilities is a sign that the virus continues to be widespread and taking a toll on San Diegans, especially older people and those with underlying chronic conditions,” Wooten said.
County to Deploy Compliance Team
A team made up of County staff will be working with representatives from local jurisdictions to address complaints about businesses that are flagrantly not complying with the local health order.
While most businesses have reopened safely and scaled back their operations when asked by the state and the county, some businesses have refused to modify operations or close.
The Safe Reopening Compliance Team will go out to businesses and establishments across the region to ensure compliance with the local Public Health Order and to slow the spread of COVID-19. If they refuse, more strict measures could be taken.
Residents can report businesses defying the public health guidance by calling their local police department’s non-emergency line. 
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Two new outbreaks were identified on July 21, one in a business and one in a healthcare setting.
In the past seven days, 12 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.

Testing:

8,280 tests were reported to the County on July 21 and 7% were positive new cases.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 6.0%. The target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 9,155.

Cases: 

587 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 25,107.
2,279 or 9.1% of cases have required hospitalization.
592 or 2.4% of all cases and 26% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

231,No COVID-19 Testing Required Before Employees Can Go Back to Work,"Based on new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is no longer recommended that employers require employees who tested positive for COVID-19 to be tested again before they can return to work.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/no-covid-19-testing-required-before-employees-can-go-back-to-work/,2020-07-27T17:06:48-07:00,"
Based on new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is no longer recommended that employers require employees who tested positive for COVID-19 to be tested again before they can return to work.
The CDC test-based strategy is no longer recommended to determine when to discontinue home isolation, except in certain circumstances.
People with COVID-19 who have mild to moderate symptoms and were directed to care for themselves at home may discontinue isolation under the following conditions:

At least 10 days have passed since symptoms began, have not had a fever for 24 hours without taking fever reducing medications and other symptoms have resolved.
A limited number of people who have severe or critical illness or are severely immunocompromised are recommended to wait 20 days after symptoms developed and one day after fever resolution and improving symptoms.
People who are severely immunocompromised but have no symptoms can leave isolation after 20 days after testing positive.
People who tested positive for the novel coronavirus but never developed symptoms can stop isolation and other precautions 10 days after the date of their first diagnostic positive test virus.

“Employers do not need to follow the test-based strategy for their employees to go back to work,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Employers must ensure that employees have met the new criteria to be released from isolation.”
The County has updated the County’s Health Officer Order to reflect these changes.
Deaths, Cases in Congregate and Community Settings
To date, 133 COVID-19 deaths and 1,054 cases (675 residents and 379 staff) have been reported in skilled-nursing facilities.
Eighty-nine deaths and 1,074 cases (649 residents and 425 staff) have been reported in other congregate settings.
In comparison, nine COVID-19 deaths and a total 981 cases have been reported in outbreaks in community settings.

232,6 in 10 Adult San Diegans Face Severe Impacts If They Contract COVID-19,Six out of every 10 adult San Diegans are at extra risk for severe illness should they contract the novel coronavirus.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/6-in-10-adult-san-diegans-face-severe-impacts-if-they-contract-covid-19/,2020-07-29T16:55:19-07:00,"
Six out of every 10 adult San Diegans are at extra risk for severe illness should they contract the novel coronavirus.
That’s because about 57% of San Diego County adults have pre-existing medical conditions such as high blood pressure, heart and lung disease, cancer, diabetes and obesity.
San Diegans with underlying chronic conditions are at increased risks of serious outcomes if they contract COVID-19, requiring to be hospitalized, placed in intensive care or worse, dying.
To date, 95% of San Diegans who died from COVID-19 had an underlying medical conditions.
“COVID-19 deaths can be prevented,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It’s important to remember that our actions matter. We must all do all we can to prevent from contracting and spreading the virus.”
It’s true that younger San Diegans with COVID-19 typically don’t need to be hospitalized, that is not the case for older adults. Of the 2,459 people who were hospitalized due to COVID-19, about 52% were 60 years of age or older.
“Some San Diegans think they’re not going to get sick and therefore are not following the public health guidance,” said Wooten. “What they don’t realize is that they could get infected and pass the virus to others who are vulnerable.”

Since early July, the County has been on the state’s Monitoring List because of a case rate above 100 cases per 100,000 population, causing additional restrictions on some local businesses. A second County trigger resulted in the hiring of more case investigators and a third, related to outbreaks, continues to be elevated.
Today, County health officials announced the case rate has been steadily dropping. After reaching a high of 158.5 on July 23, the rate for the region has declined to 118.2.
“The results over the past seven days are promising and are due to everyone doing their part to change this metric,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “So, keep up the great work, San Diego.”
For the County to be off the state’s watchlist, it would have to report 240 cases or fewer for 14 days in a row.
Another trigger that has been improving is the seven-day average percentage of case investigations initiated within 24 hours after a positive case is assigned. After reaching a low of 7% July 18, the percentage has dramatically increased in the past few days and is now at 48%, after the County added more than 200 case investigators. More case investigators will be coming onboard in the days and weeks to come.
This investigation metric, Wooten said, is likely to be normal in the next week or two.
“We’re adding new staff, and this is helping to improve this particular metric,” Wooten said.
The third trigger that has been consistently in the red and is trending in the wrong direction is the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in a community setting over a seven-day period.
Over the past seven days, 39 community outbreaks have been confirmed, the highest seven-day total since the pandemic began. Fifteen of the 39 outbreaks were reported in restaurant/bar settings, seven in businesses, four in restaurants without bars and the rest in other settings.
County Opens Testing Site in Pacific Beach
The County is opening a COVID-19 testing site in Pacific Beach due to the increasing number of cases in the area.
The drive-up site will offer free testing Tuesdays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Pacific Beach/Taylor Branch Library, located at 4275 Cass Street in San Diego.
Appointments are required and can be made five days in advance. They can be made online at www.211sandiego.org or by calling 2-1-1. For a complete list of other testing sites, visit coronavirus-sd.com.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

236,"Board Creates Compliance Hotline, Allocates CARES Act Funds",The County Board of Supervisors today received an update on the County’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and took a number of actions that will facilitate enforcement against businesses and individuals violating the local public health order.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-creates-compliance-hotline-allocates-cares-act-funds/,2020-08-05T09:16:29-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors Tuesday received an update on the County’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and took a number of actions to promote compliance with the local public health order, including an expanded team that will take enforcement actions when businesses and individuals don’t follow the order’s requirements. 
The Healthy Compliance Call Center will allow the public to report violations to the order. The line will be staffed around the clock and can be reached at (858) 694-2900.
The Board also heard several proposals on how the County plans to spend $48.8 million of federal CARES Act money that has been allocated to the region.
The Board voted to devote $25 million to child care, $18.8 million to food services programs and $5 million to public health test, trace and treat (T3) strategies in K-12 schools.
The child care provider grant program will fund licensed and license-exempt child care providers experiencing financial hardships due to COVID-19. Child care providers can use funding to pay for a variety of expenses including rent and mortgage payments, personal protective equipment, staffing and supplies.
Grants will be distributed equitably across the county and will be based on the size of the child care facility. All types of child care facilities from family-run to large organizations are eligible to apply.
The CARES Act funding for food programs will be directed to the Great Plates Delivered program for seniors and expand that program to more County residents. The County will also allocate $3.5 million each to support food banks and struggling restaurants in the region.
The Board also set aside $5 million which will fund T3 efforts in the region’s schools once they are permitted to resume in-person instruction.
COVID-19 Update
Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten updated the Board on the COVID-19 situation in the County. Dr. Wooten outlined some of the drivers of the recent high case rate, the factor that put the County on the state’s monitoring list.
The case rate metric has been elevated since the end of June, with many of the cases having been linked to the statewide reopening of businesses at the time. While case rates are still too high to get the County off the state watchlist, the numbers have been showing signs of improvement in recent days.
Dr. Wooten further explained that a majority of recent cases have been found in specific populations of County residents. Of the lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases in the past two weeks, 42.3% were in those 20-39 years of age.
Additional high case occurrences were confirmed in food service employees and individuals whose illness has been traced to community setting outbreaks. A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.

237,‘Promotoras’ Working in Latino Communities to Prevent Spread of COVID-19,Community health workers known as promotoras started working in local Latino communities earlier this week to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Promotoras are long-time and trusted residents of the communities they serve.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/promotoras-working-in-latino-communities-to-prevent-spread-of-covid-1/,2020-08-05T18:49:37-07:00,"
Community health workers known as promotoras started working in local Latino communities earlier this week to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Promotoras are long-time and trusted residents of the communities they serve.
The first group began doing contact tracing in the South Bay. Their role is to contact people who were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, ask them to quarantine themselves and guide them through the quarantine process.
Teams of promotoras who speak English and Spanish are being deployed into Latino communities that are being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. Their work is being done through a collaboration between the County, Project Concern International and South Bay Community Services.
Their role is to connect with close contacts within 24 hours after getting the case. They will contact the person by phone, email or text and, in special cases, through in-person visits taking the appropriate preventative measures. Their goal is to make sure people are in quarantine, stay in contact with them to find out if they develop symptoms and give them information and resources to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
“These are our neighbors we all know and trust,” said Mauricio Torre, vice president of programs and operations for South Bay Community Services. “The continuous contact is done with the goal of keeping the individual well-informed on the resources and actions to take…to protect the community’s health.”
More promotoras, many of whom speak other languages such as Arabic and Tagalog, will be coming onboard next week through a collaboration with San Diego State University. They will also work in Latino neighborhoods and other underserved communities.
Case Investigations Improve Significantly
The hundreds of case investigators the County brought onboard has helped the case investigation trigger to move from red to green. The metric requires that 71% or more case investigations begin within 24 hours after a positive case is assigned. The seven-day rolling average is now at 73% after hitting a low of 7% July 23.
“In the past seven days we’ve been increasing due to bringing additional case investigators,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This is very good news. As of yesterday, we were not backlogged with any of our case investigation assignments.”
The local goal for case investigations started within 24 hours is 90% and, Wooten said, the County is likely to meet it next week.
County Parks Open for Worship and Workouts
To help businesses stay open during the pandemic, the County Board of Supervisors today voted to allow reservable areas at County parks to be used by places of worship, gyms and other fitness-oriented establishments.
The application process is being streamlined and reservation fees are being waived. Day use parking fees, equipment rental fees and utility costs beyond normal park use are still applicable.

The County Department of Parks and Recreation will review all applications to determine if the requests meet the fee waiver criteria, are compatible with ongoing park activities, can operate with the available infrastructure in the park and not cause damage to the natural environment or landscape.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Five new outbreaks were identified on Aug. 4: one in a preschool, two in business settings, one in a faith-based organization and one in a restaurant/bar setting.
In the past seven days, 30 community outbreaks were identified.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.

Testing:

6,981 tests were reported to the County on Aug. 4 and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases was 5%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 5.3%. Target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 7,114.

Cases:

348 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 30,864.
2,655 or 8.6% of cases have required hospitalization.
666 or 2.2% of all cases and 25.1% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

10 new COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County on Aug. 4 and the region’s total is now 578.
Six men and four women died between June 23 and Aug. 4, and their ages ranged from 60 to 87 years of age.

238,Postcards to Registered Voters – They Will Get Mail Ballots,"The Registrar of Voters is sending postcards to over 1.8 million registered voters in San Diego County this week telling them to expect a mail ballot for the November 3, 2020 Presidential General Election. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/postcards-to-registered-voters-they-will-get-mail-ballots/,2020-08-06T11:57:23-07:00,"
The Registrar of Voters is sending postcards to over 1.8 million registered voters in San Diego County this week telling them to expect a mail ballot for the November 3, 2020 Presidential General Election.
In light of COVID-19, the Governor signed two executive orders to send mail ballots to every active registered voter in California so they can exercise their right to vote in a safe, secure and accessible manner. Those who need to vote in person will also have that option.
What does this mean for you?

Nearly 75% of the county’s registered voters are already signed up to permanently receive their ballot by mail so the Registrar’s Office is well positioned to manage this increase.
If you need to vote in person, polling places will be open for four days, Oct. 31 through Election Day, Nov. 3. Be prepared. There will be fewer locations than in prior elections, so your location has most likely changed.

What do you need to do? 
Be Vote Ready!

Check your registration information. Make sure your residence and, if different, your mailing address is up to date.
Have you moved or changed your name? Whether you are new to San Diego County or just moved down the street you need to re-register to vote.
Are you a first-time voter? Register to vote – it takes less than two minutes.

In response to the governor’s executive orders, the Registrar of Voters office has launched a Vote Safer San Diego campaign to encourage voters to vote from home.
Ballots will start going out in the mail the week of Oct. 5, giving voters nearly a month to mark their ballot and return it before Election Day.
You can now track your mail ballot every step of the way by signing up for “Where’s My Ballot?”. Sign up now to receive automatic notifications at sdvote.com.
What if you need to vote in person?
The Registrar’s office encourages you to take advantage of early voting:

8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday starting Oct. 5 at the Registrar’s office.
8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Saturday, Oct. 31 through Monday, Nov. 2 at your assigned polling place or the Registrar’s office.

The Registrar’s Office and polling places will be open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 3.
If you decide to vote in person, be sure to bring your mail ballot with you and prepare for long lines. The Registrar especially encourages older adults and people with underlying medical conditions to avoid long lines and crowded polling places by voting early.

240,New Budget Goes Before County Supervisors,"The first of two virtual public hearings on the County’s budget took place at the Board of Supervisors meeting Monday.   The County transformed its new budget to meet rising demands amidst COVID-19, the economic crisis and worldwide calls for social justice and racial equality.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-budget-goes-before-county-supervisors/,2020-08-10T15:01:22-07:00,"
The first of two virtual public hearings on the County’s budget took place at the Board of Supervisors meeting Monday.
The County transformed its new budget to meet rising demands amidst COVID-19, the economic crisis and worldwide calls for social justice and racial equality.
The recommended $6.4 billion budget for fiscal year 2020-21 shows an increase of $159 million or 2.5% over last year and includes $100 million to fight the COVID-19 public health crisis. The recommended budget also calls for dipping into the County’s reserves.
“There are not many new programs or capital investments, and it eliminates some vacant staff positions. The County is not cutting core services and we will boost our commitment to assisting vulnerable populations,” said Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer. “We are able to do this at a time when many local governments are struggling to stay afloat.”
The pandemic coupled with the economic downturn are slashing revenue at a time when costs are rapidly rising. Despite these challenges, the County is required by law to balance the budget.  
To address major revenue shortfalls and expenditure needs, the County’s budget strategy relies on spending available one-time funds from the County’s General Fund reserves and from balances outside of the General Fund while also slowing down or stopping non-essential services and projects.  
The County’s top budgetary priority is battling COVID-19. The Health and Human Services Agency will see an increase of $100 million to reduce the pandemic’s spread and allow for responsible reopening. The funding will go toward efforts tied to responding to COVID-19, including the Testing, Tracing and Treatment Strategy (T3), food distribution, medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and shelter.  
Another $15 million will pay for technology needs to support behavioral health services, including: telehealth, electronic health record upgrades, outreach and engagement, workforce recruitment and retention. 
The County is also providing a wide array of online services to customers that range from help for behavioral health issues, to permitting, to digital library books. Parks is offering virtual programs as well, including Movies in the Park. 
The Registrar of Voters office is busy planning for the November presidential election but this time, needs to ensure it is conducted in the safest way possible during this pandemic.   
While COVID-19 appears to overshadow many aspects of our lives, the County is still supporting vulnerable people. 
To strengthen children and families, the County will continue to serve over 1 million San Diegans every month with Medi-Cal, CalFresh, CalWORKs and General Relief, and also help enroll low income families and others affected by the pandemic’s economic fallout. Child Welfare Services will expand upon efforts to strengthen families and address disproportionality and disparities. Seniors will be supported through efforts such as the Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation program and Alzheimer’s awareness.  
A $23.7 million increase will address homelessness in the unincorporated area and another $0.4 million will be used to develop a Flexible Housing Subsidy Pool in collaboration with the Regional Task Force on the Homeless to help move those experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.  
A $3 million increase will help address homelessness among youth up to the age of 24, with a focus on youth transitioning from foster care and young parents experiencing homelessness. The Sheriff’s Homeless Assistance Resource Team (HART) will see a $2.6 million increase to expand its program.  
In the area of behavioral health, the County continues to transform the multi-sectoral system of care from one driven by crisis, to one of continuous care and prevention, by providing coordinated resources to keep people connected, stable and healthy. This includes increased investments for diversionary services, such as the expansion of Crisis Stabilization Units, and increases to help community providers expand their capacity for long–term treatment. The County will also continue its partnership with UC San Diego Health to develop a behavioral health hub on County-owned property in Hillcrest.   
Nationwide conversations are driving change in public safety. De-escalation training for law enforcement agencies is a priority to strengthen community trust, equity and racial justice. By the end of the year, nearly 3,000 officers are expected to complete training through the District Attorney’s office, with an additional 1,600 through the Sheriff’s Department. The Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board will have increased authority and expanded resources to provide independent oversight of the Sheriff’s Department and Probation. 
The Board of Supervisors created a new Office of Equity and Racial Justice to examine bias within the County organization, which will also work with the newly formed Human Relations Commission. The Commission will collaborate with community organizations to address disparities and create more equitable programs, services and resources for all. 
Plans are in the works to create the District Attorney North County Family Justice Center to further protect victims of crime. The County is also designing an earthquake early warning system pilot program and building two fire stations, one in Mt. Laguna and the other at Palomar Mountain.   
The County is on track to nearly double the number of affordable housing units in its portfolio over five years to help low income, special needs and homeless residents using local, state and federal funds. Pre-approved plans, permit and impact fee waivers are available for the construction of granny flats or accessory dwelling units to help ease the affordable housing shortage.  
The budget includes funds to protect and improve the region’s air quality, including $5.0 million for addressing vehicle emissions and $21.1 million to implement the Community Air Protection Program that continues to monitor air quality in communities most vulnerable to air pollution.  
The capital program includes:   

$22.3 million to enhance and renovate the Rock Mountain Detention Facility 
$15.0 million for design and construction of Innovative Residential Rehabilitation Program 
$14.9 million for multiple facilities major maintenance capital projects  
$7.2 million for construction of Mt. Laguna and Palomar Mountain Fire Stations and planning of the East Otay Mesa Fire Station 
$9.3 million for expansion and improvements at various County parks including Lincoln Acres Park expansion 
$1.7 million for expansion and construction at the Rancho San Diego Library and Casa de Oro Library 
$0.6 million for electric vehicle installation and improvements at County facilities 

The Fiscal Year 2020-21 Capital Program also includes partial funding for the following capital projects: 

$14.5 million for the County Administration Center (CAC) phased renovations 
$7.5 million for North Coastal Live Well Health Center improvements 
$2.0 million for planning the Third Avenue Mental Health Inpatient Facility Hub, Hillcrest 
$2.0 million for the Edgemoor Psychiatric Unit 
$0.4 million for the San Diego Juvenile Justice Campus (Phase II) 

An evening virtual hearing will take place at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, Aug. 12.  
The public can see today’s presentation in advance of Wednesday’s evening hearing and get additional details about the recommended operational plan through the online budget portal. The public can also submit comments to the Board through e-comment.

241,County to Open New COVID-19 Testing Site at Border,A new COVID-19 testing site will begin operating Wednesday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry PedEast crossing.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-open-new-covid-19-testing-site-at-border/,2020-08-11T18:18:31-07:00,"
A new COVID-19 testing site will begin operating Wednesday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry PedEast crossing.
The free site will operate from 6:30 to 10:30 a.m. Monday through Friday and will focus on testing essential workers and American citizens who live in Tijuana, as well as residents of the area.
No appointments are necessary at the walk-up site, which will offer about 200 tests daily. People getting tested will not be asked their immigration status or who lives with them.
“We know that communities in South Bay have been hit the hardest by COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The location was selected because of the increase in cases in the region and the number of people, especially essential workers who cross daily.”
The new location is one of ten County and state sites operating in South County and is part of the County’s ongoing efforts to address COVID-19 in the region, which has been disproportionately affected by the novel coronavirus.
Another no-appointment testing site opened this week at California State University San Marcos. Appointments are necessary for most County testing sites. To make an appointment, visit www.211sandiego.org or call 2-1-1.

“Great Plates” Program Extended Again
About 2,000 older adults in the “Great Plates Delivered” program will continue to receive three free and healthy meals a day until Sep. 9.
Launched in mid-May, the program is a collaboration between the County and local restaurants to help older adults, who are at a higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19, avoid going out to restaurants or the grocery store to get food.
Currently, 31 local restaurants are delivering meals to enrolled seniors throughout San Diego County. The County is reimbursing restaurants for the cost of food, labor and incidentals, using a combination of funding provided by FEMA, the state and the County.
Those currently receiving assistance from other state or federal nutrition assistance programs, such as CalFresh or Meals on Wheels, are not eligible for the Great Plates Delivered program. Participants must also fall within a specific income range.
The County is also in the process of developing “Great Plates Delivered 2.0” which will focus on serving people with disabilities. More local restaurants will be recruited for the new program which is expected to launch in a few weeks.
For more details on criteria, call the County Aging and Independence Services at (800) 339-4661 or visit www.aging.sandiegocounty.gov/greatplates. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego.

242,County Selects Local Projects for $21 Million in Grants to Improve Air Quality,"The Air Pollution Control District has selected projects from 49 organizations to receive $21.3 million in grants that would keep 692 tons of climate-changing, greenhouse gas and pollution — roughly the weight of six space shuttle spacecraft — out of local skies.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-selects-local-projects-for-21-million-in-grants-to-improve-air-quality/,2020-08-12T10:30:39-07:00,"
The County’s Air Pollution Control District has selected projects from 49 organizations to receive $21.3 million in grants that would keep 692 tons of climate-changing, greenhouse gas and pollution — roughly the weight of six space shuttle spacecraft — out of local skies.
The grants, part of the County’s Clean Air for All campaign, will reimburse the selected businesses, local governments, schools and utilities for swapping out high-polluting, heavy-duty equipment for low-polluting or zero-polluting vehicles, boats and machinery.
The District has notified all the organizations that their projects have been selected to receive the grants funded by California’s Air Resources Board and Department of Motor Vehicles. All the organizations must still sign contracts to start their projects; seven of the projects must still receive final approval from the California Air Resources Board. The organizations are reimbursed once their projects are completed.
District officials estimate that if all 138 selected projects are completed they would improve local air quality over their lifetime by preventing the emission of 562.5 tons of nitrogen engine emissions (NOx), 103.5 tons of Reactive Organic Gases (ROG) that affect ozone production; and 26.1 tons of diesel particulate matter (PM), small particles of carbon like soot.
A list of the selected projects can be seen on the District’s website.
Most of the grant money, roughly $14.3 million, is targeted to help the County’s Portside Environmental Justice Neighborhood communities and projects from other state-designated disadvantaged communities. Those include the Portside communities of Barrio Logan, Logan Heights, Sherman Heights and western National City, and El Cajon and San Ysidro.
The Portside Environmental Justice Neighborhood was one of the first 10 such neighborhoods to be selected by the California Air Resources Board to be part of its Community Air Protection Program. That program provides special funding for neighborhoods that are disproportionately harmed by air pollution because they’re near ports, shipping, freeways, rail yards, freight, warehouses and industries. The Air Resources Board created its program in response to California’s 2017 passage of Assembly Bill 617, which aimed to help local communities threatened the most by air pollution.
Some of the selected Portside and disadvantaged communities’ projects include truck, school bus, port equipment and marine replacements.
The remaining $6.98 million in grants come from a mixture of state air quality improvement funds and will primarily be spent to upgrade off-road vehicles, agricultural equipment and marine equipment for 36 organizations.

243,"First Human, Travel-Related West Nile Virus Case of 2020 Reported in County","A 61-year-old man from Alpine has been confirmed to be the first person in San Diego County in 2020 to test positive for West Nile virus, the County Health and Human Services announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/first-human-travel-related-west-nile-virus-case-of-2020-reported-in-county/,2020-08-12T11:55:54-07:00,"
A 61-year-old man from Alpine has been confirmed to be the first person in San Diego County in 2020 to test positive for West Nile virus, the County Health and Human Services announced today.
The man was hospitalized, tested and the California Department of Public Health confirmed the case Aug. 11. He has recovered.
The man said he had traveled to Yuma, Arizona where it is believed he contracted the virus.
Since Jan. 1, 2020, there have been two West Nile virus positive detections in mosquitoes during routine trapping by the County Vector Control Program, one in the Del Mar Area and the other in the Black Mountain Ranch area.
There were only three human cases of West Nile virus in San Diego County in 2019 and two in 2018.
West Nile virus is mainly a bird disease but can be transmitted to people by certain species of native San Diego County mosquitoes that first feed on an infected bird or animal and then a bite a person.
Eighty percent of people who become infected with West Nile virus never know it and never suffer any symptoms. About one in five people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. About 1 out of 150 infected people could get extremely ill and die.
County public health and environmental health officials say the best way for people to protect themselves against the virus is to follow the County’s Prevent, Protect, Report guidelines. These guidelines can also help county residents protect themselves from mosquitoes that transit West Nile virus as well as invasive Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit tropical diseases, including Zika, dengue and chikungunya, if they first bite an infected person and then bite non-infected people.
Prevent mosquito breeding

Dump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as unused swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.
Protect yourself from mosquito bites
Protect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.
Report possible mosquito activity
Report increased mosquito activity, or neglected, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds — dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls — to Environmental Health’s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov. Also, report if you are being bitten by mosquitoes during daylight hours, or if you find mosquitoes that match the description of Aedes mosquitoes by contacting the Vector Control Program at (858) 694-2888.
For more information about mosquito-borne illnesses, go to San Diego County’s “Fight the Bite” website.

Are you looking for unconditional love, companionship and fun? We may have the next big love of your life waiting for you at one of our animal shelters. The County Department of Animal Services is participating in this year’s monthlong Clear the Shelters adoption event being done online to prevent potential spread of coronavirus.

The event is sponsored by NBC and Telemundo with the goal of finding homes for as many pets as possible through media exposure and promotions. Usually the event lasts only a few days but it runs through Aug. 31 this year. Last year, the County adopted out 119 pets for the event.

County shelters are offering all pets that have been in our care longer than 30 days for a discounted adoption fee of just $5.
Animal personalities and energy run the gamut. If you are looking for a pal to go on long walks or a run with or perhaps a couch cuddlebug, you will likely find them in one of our animals.
To see the available dogs, cats and others including pigs, a turtle, a love bird and a rabbit who could be your faithful friend for life, please visit the adoptions page and fill out an online application that includes their ID number. Due to public health safety precautions, adoptions are by appointment only.
Currently, about 46 pets are available at the County’s two animal care facilities located in Bonita and Carlsbad. All the adopted animals will be spayed or neutered, and microchipped before they go home. Vaccinations will also be up to date on dogs and cats.

Normal adoption fees are: kittens under 6 months old, $75; cats, $65; puppies under 6 months, $100; and dogs, $75.

245,County Edges Closer to Getting Off State Monitoring List,"The County continues its recent downward trend in its COVID-19 case rate, meeting day two of three days required to get off the state’s monitoring list. Currently, the State’s case rate for the County is at 98.3 per 100,000 people. The State’s case rate for our region was 94.1 Wednesday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-edges-closer-to-getting-off-state-monitoring-list/,2020-08-13T16:38:50-07:00,"
The County continues its recent downward trend in its COVID-19 case rate, meeting day two of three days required to get off the state’s monitoring list.
Currently, the State’s case rate for the County is at 98.3 per 100,000 people. The State’s case rate for our region was 94.1 Wednesday. Those numbers were the lowest since the County was placed on the State’s Monitoring List on July 3.
The state metric requires a rate below 100 cases per every 100,000 residents to get off its monitoring list. The normal rate must continue for an additional 14 days or until after Aug. 28 before K through 12 schools can reopen.
“The schools may re-open at that time, but the State must provide guidance on other sectors re-opening such as businesses that cannot currently operate indoors,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The County does not have that authority.”
Elementary schools may request waivers from the State to operate but they must be reviewed by the County first. So far, 48 are under review.
The State’s 98.3 case rate for this region differs from the County’s 96.5 rate because it is calculated differently. The County’s numbers reflect the number of cases as of 11:59 p.m. the day before. The State may be one day behind. The State also excludes inmates in their report.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Two new outbreaks were confirmed on Aug. 12, one each in a business and food processing.
In the past seven days, 22 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households in the past 14 days.

Testing:

8,020 tests were reported to the County on Aug. 12. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases was 3%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 4.6%. Target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 7,972.

Cases:

266 new cases were reported in San Diego County for a total of 33,659.
2,809 or 8.3% of cases have required hospitalization.
699 or 2.1% of all cases and 24.8% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

Seven new COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County on Aug 12. The region’s total is now 615.
Four women and three men man died between July 31 and Aug. 11, and their ages ranged from 44 to 90.
All had underlying medical conditions.

246,State Moves County’s Removal from Watch List to Tuesday,"The state has reviewed its data and determined that the County’s three-day metric of fewer than 100 cases per every 100,00 residents started Aug. 15 and it’s anticipated to end today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/state-moves-countys-removal-from-watch-list-to-tuesday/,2020-08-17T17:12:32-07:00,"
The state has reviewed its data and determined that the County’s three-day metric of fewer than 100 cases per every 100,00 residents started Aug. 15 and it’s anticipated to end today. That means the region could be off the Monitoring List on Tuesday, Aug. 18, and the 14-day period for schools to reopen could begin.
The state’s case rate for the past three days is:

Aug. 17: 89.8
Aug. 16: 91.8
Aug. 15: 94.7

Should the County continue to hold its case rate below 100 in the days ahead, the 14-day wait period would end Aug. 31 and all schools could reopen for in-person teaching after that. No other businesses would be allowed to modify their operations until the state gives further guidance.
“The state reassigned backlogged tests and recalculated their figures and, unfortunately, that has shifted the 17-day wait period for all local schools to reopen,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should be patient as we await further guidance from the state to determine what businesses could reopen.”
Local health officials continue to urge San Diegans to follow the recommended precautions so that the case rate remains below 100. That includes using a face covering when in public, maintaining physical distance, avoiding large gatherings, staying home if sick and regular hand-washing.
Wearing a face covering protects you and others from COVID-19.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Two new outbreaks were identified on Aug. 16: one in a grocery setting and one in a grocery/retail setting.
In the past seven days, 21 community outbreaks were identified.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.

247,"County Off State Monitoring List, Businesses Still on Hold","San Diego County was removed Tuesday from the state’s County Monitoring List, but local businesses are still under restrictions. The County met a state metric for fewer than 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for a third consecutive day on Monday.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-off-state-monitoring-list-businesses-still-on-hold/,2020-08-18T14:11:45-07:00,"
San Diego County was removed Tuesday from the state’s County Monitoring List, but local businesses are still under restrictions. The County met a state metric for fewer than 100 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people for a third consecutive day on Monday.
The case rate must remain under 100 for an additional 14 days, until Aug. 31, before K through 12 schools can reopen, if they choose to do so.
For now, all current restrictions on businesses or other activities, including those required to operate outdoors, remain in place. The restrictions will continue even after the 14-day period, unless the state provides additional guidance.
“Getting off the state’s County Monitoring List is a great first step, but we need to keep it up for another two weeks before all schools can open for in-person learning,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
The County was placed on the state’s Monitoring List more than six weeks ago, on July 3. To continue the downward trend in County case numbers, Dr. Wooten urges San Diegans to continue to wear face coverings, keep six feet apart, avoid large gatherings, frequently wash your hands and stay home if you’re sick.
 "
248,How San Diegans Can Help Keep COVID-19 Case Rate Down,"With the County’s COVID-19 case rate continuing to decline, local health officials are urging San Diegans to keep taking measures to prevent the spread of the novel virus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/how-san-diegans-can-help-keep-covid-19-case-rate-down/,2020-08-19T18:11:31-07:00,"
With the County’s COVID-19 case rate continuing to decline, local health officials are urging San Diegans to keep taking measures to prevent the spread of the novel virus.
The County’s case rate is now at 85.2 and below the state watchlist threshold of 100 cases per every 100,000 residents. Because of that, the region is now in the second day of the 14-day period before all K-12 schools can reopen, if they choose to do so.
To make sure the region gets to that point, it’s important that all San Diegans keep taking the necessary actions to prevent COVID-19 community outbreaks and the spread of the virus. They include:

Wear face coverings
Maintain physical distance
Wash your hands
Avoid crowded places
Stay home if you are sick

“Because there is no treatment or vaccine, this is really what we have to wrap our arms around to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diego residents have done a phenomenal job in helping to push our case rate below 100.”
Why Outbreak Locations Are Not Released
Many San Diegans have asked for the County to release the names and locations where COVID-19 community outbreaks are identified.
Currently, the County is not releasing the names of outbreak locations because there is no action that the public needs to take. There is no higher risk of infection at these locations because the virus is widespread.
“Avoiding businesses where an outbreak has been identified does not lower your risk of infection,” Wooten said. “If there was a specific threat to public health, we would release that information.”
For example, Wooten said that the County would make public the location of a community outbreak if it posed a threat to the public, such as the E.coli outbreak at the 2019 San Diego County Fair or the measles outbreak that started at Disneyland in late 2014.
“We release information when there is an action that an individual or the public could or should take,” Wooten said.
County COVID-19 Testing to Be Done by Priority
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Public Health Department recently updated their testing guidance, but their recommended priority categories/tiers were broad and did not address frequency.
Recognizing that local healthcare providers, especially those with limited supplies and capacity, would have challenges adopting the new guidance, the County worked with partners to set the local priority levels.
Earlier this week, an advisory went out to the local medical community with the updated five testing tiers:

People with symptoms who are hospitalized, in congregate facilities, older adults, have underlying medical conditions or are part of a vulnerable population. People identified by public health investigations and disease control activities.
People with symptoms such as healthcare workers and first responders, as well as patients requiring hospitalization and people who require surgical procedures.
People without symptoms in congregate living facilities and close contacts of people who tested positive.
People without symptoms such as healthcare workers, first responders, vulnerable populations, essential workers, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions and their caretakers.
People without symptoms who are being tested for purposes of public health surveillance.

San Diego Public Health organizes free COVID-19 testing locations countywide. Appointments can be made at online, while three walk-in locations offer no-appointment testing where no one is turned away.
Case Rate:

The region’s state-calculated case rate is 85.4 for Aug. 19. and the County was removed from the state’s monitoring list yesterday.
The County will now need to report a case rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people for an additional 13 days. Then all schools, grades K-12, can reopen.
The list of schools that have submitted waiver applications and received waivers to reopen can be found here.
No other businesses can reopen until the state provides further guidance.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

Two new outbreaks were identified on Aug. 18: one in a business and one in a restaurant.
In the past seven days, 15 community outbreaks were identified.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households.    

Testing:

6,781 tests were reported to the County on Aug. 16 and the number of laboratory-confirmed cases was 3%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 4.0%. Target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 7,798.

249,Near-Drowning Incidents Increase in Children During Pandemic,"An increasing number of San Diego children have had to be rescued from private pools after nearly drowning, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/near-drowning-incidents-increase-in-children-during-pandemic/,2020-08-20T10:45:31-07:00,"
An increasing number of San Diego children have had to be rescued from private pools after nearly drowning, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Local data shows that 49 rescues occurred in private pools, beaches and bays from March through July 2020 compared to 37 in the same time period of 2019 and 33 the year before that. Nearly all those rescued needed to be taken to local hospitals for treatment.
Of the 49 near-drowning incidents reported this year, 28 occurred in pools, most of them private pools. Fourteen occurred in the ocean, lakes or bays and the rest in unknown bodies of water.
Twenty-four of the swimming incidents reported over the same period occurred in private pools and involved children 14 years and under. Some public pools have been closed due to COVID-19. In comparison, 18 occurred in 2019 and 21 the year before that.
From March through July over the past three years, nine children and babies drowned in San Diego County. All but two were 2 years of age or younger:
2020:   2 (one in a bathtub and one in a private pool)
2019:   5 (all in private pools)
2018:   2 (one in a bathtub and one in a private pool)
“Parents and guardians must take the necessary precautions to keep these incidents from happening,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Children who swim in pools at home are at higher risk of drowning, especially as parents struggle to supervise their children while continuing to work at home through the summer months because of the novel coronavirus.
“Parents should think safety first when children are near or in pools or other bodies of water to prevent injury and accidental drowning,” Wooten said.
Here are some tips to minimize your risk and your children’s risk of drowning.
General Water Safety:

Teach children to swim
Never leave a child unsupervised in or near water
Avoid alcohol
Learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

 Residential Swimming Pools and Spas:

Install a fence around the pool and hot tub. Many jurisdictions have detailed laws regarding how this is done.
Install alarms
Remove toys. On the deck they can be a tripping hazard, or in the water they can attract children.
Beware of drains
Follow all swimming rules posted at swimming areas
Keep emergency equipment handy

Natural Bodies of Water:

Always swim with a buddy
Swim only in areas that have a lifeguard
Wear a life jacket
Enter water feet first for the initial descent
Never leave children unobserved, even for short periods of time

Toilets, Bathtubs and Buckets:

Keep the bathroom door closed
Supervise bath time
Shut toilet lids
Store buckets safely

The California Paramedic Foundation will soon be launching a social media campaign to warn parents about the dangers of unsupervised swimming.
More information and prevention strategies can be found at Mayo Clinic and Safe Kids.

250,County Partners with San Diego State University for PSA Campaign,The County of San Diego is rolling out a new set of public service announcements created by San Diego State University students to raise awareness about safety measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-partners-with-san-diego-state-university-for-psa-campaign/,2020-08-20T13:00:00-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is rolling out a new set of public service announcements created by San Diego State University students to raise awareness about safety measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19. Students were asked to create video messages specifically targeting their peers.
The campaign comes in response to a spike in cases in young people, particularly in the 20-29 age group. One in four lab-confirmed cases in the San Diego region are in that age group.
The PSA contest invited students to submit 15- to 30-second videos, in English or Spanish, that highlight the importance of frequent hand washing, social distancing and wearing face coverings. A committee of both county and SDSU staff selected the winning videos.
“We really appreciate the creativity and continued partnership of SDSU’s School of Public Health as we collectively address the ongoing threat of the novel coronavirus,” said Nick Macchione, director of the County’s Health and Human Services Agency and lead of T-3, the county’s program to expand COVID-19 testing, tracing and treatment throughout the region. “The videos I watched clearly and effectively delivered all the right messages to our youth population.”
The county has a longstanding partnership with SDSU and the university is one of the county’s Live Well San Diego partners. As such, the university has adopted the county’s vision for a region that is healthy, safe and thriving.
“This contest was an opportunity to support the county’s effort to reach youth through peer to peer messaging,” said Hala Madanat, director of the SDSU School of Public Health and lead organizer of the contest. “SDSU students rose to the occasion producing outstanding videos that send a clear message about the importance of social distancing, wearing face coverings, and hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19. I am so proud of our students.”
Both the county and SDSU will use the winning videos on social media to promote the importance of following public health guidelines.

251,County Launches Recycle Right Campaign,"Of course, you recycle! You care; you want to protect the environment. But are you recycling right? You might not be. If you’re putting the wrong items into your curbside blue bin, or even the right item in the wrong way,  you could be trashing your good intentions. And other people’s too.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-launches-recycle-right-campaign/,2020-08-21T09:30:04-07:00,"
Of course, you recycle! You care; you want to protect the environment. But here’s a question — are you recycling right?
You might not be. If you’re putting the wrong items into your curbside blue bin — or even the right item in the wrong way —  you could be trashing your good intentions. And other people’s too.
To help, San Diego County’s Solid Waste Planning and Recycling division has launched a “Recycle Right” newspaper-radio-social media campaign.
It features two easy-to-use messages. First, go Back to the Basics — know what  can be recycled in that blue recycling bin your waste hauler picks up at your curb.
Second, remember this simple phrase: “Empty, Dry, Loose.”
Here’s what can be recycled in that blue bin: paper, cardboard and cartons (boxes should be broken down), glass bottles and jars, plastic bottles and containers, and metal/aluminum containers and foil.
What can’t be recycled in your blue bin? Food, liquids, plastic bags, ropes, clothing, batteries and other items. Some of those things may be recycled in other ways, like returning plastic bags to stores, using compost bins and electronic waste recyclers.
Putting plastic bags, clothing and cords into your blue bin can actually create a hazard to workers or machinery at recycling centers. Putting food and liquids in can contaminate the things you’re trying to recycle, and anyone else’s items they’re mixed with. That would ruin your good intentions, and others, by forcing the contaminated items to be tossed into the trash where they end up needlessly filling landfills.
Here’s where the County “Recycle Right” campaign’s second message, “Empty, Dry, Loose,” comes in handy.
For example, let’s say you have a completely empty, dry, glass peanut butter jar. Put that in that blue bin! But if that jar is only “almost” empty, please, keep it out. It could contaminate all your items. Better yet, clean it out first (a spatula works great!) and put it in.
So, make sure cans, jars, milk cartons and other recyclable containers are empty and dry.
And put those items into your blue bin loose, NOT in plastic bags that can foul up recycling machinery. While trash collectors want your trash contained in bags — that doesn’t work for recyclables.
That’s it! Recycling is still simple with the right tips.

The case investigator and contract tracing data will show the degree to which the number of employees doing the work mirror the ethnic groups that make up the local population. Currently, the County has 435 case investigators contacting San Diegans who have tested positive for COVID-19 to give them information on what to do during isolation, finding out what places they visited and who their close contacts are. Also, there are 285 County contact tracers connecting with people who were close contacts with positive cases.
“It’s important that we have the ability to connect with people,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We need to make sure they know what to do so that they can recover safely.”
The County is also working with San Diego State University, South Bay Community Services and Project Concern International which are providing promotoras and promotores –community health workers – who are calling and doing in-home visits with people who have been close contacts of positive cases but have been difficult to reach.
Local community and faith organizations are and will be conducting community outreach to minority groups, particularly Latinos, African Americans, Asians and refugees to encourage them to get tested, pick up the phone when contacted by a case investigator or contact tracer and provide other COVID-19 resources.
Furthermore, UC San Diego will be helping the County to do contact tracing among young people, especially those between the ages of 18 and 24 years of age.
‘Great Plates’ to Continue, Expand Meal Delivery
More than 2,000 older adults in the “Great Plates Delivered” program will continue to receive three free and healthy meals a day.

254,Tuberculosis Case Reported at Morse High School,A person at Morse High School was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis and may have exposed students and staff according to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-case-reported-at-morse-high-school/,2020-08-25T10:30:19-07:00,"
A person at Morse High School was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed students and staff according to the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA).
HHSA is working with San Diego Unified School District officials to notify those who were potentially exposed and provide TB testing. The dates of exposure are from February 28, 2020, to March 13, 2020.
Morse High School is currently participating in social distancing protocols and onsite TB screening will not be available. Students who were identified as being potentially exposed to TB can get tested with their primary care provider. Students who do not have a medical provider should contact the HHSA TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621 to arrange to arrange an appointment for a free test. School teachers and staff will be provided testing by the San Diego Unified School District.
TB is transmitted from person to person through indoor air during prolonged contact with an infectious person. Most people who are exposed to TB do not become infected.
“Testing is recommended for all those exposed to make sure they are not infected, since initial infection usually has no symptoms,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If a person is infected, early diagnosis and prompt treatment can prevent the infectious form of the disease.”
Symptoms of infectious TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss. People infected with TB or who are immunocompromised, may not show symptoms. That’s why it’s important that people see their medical provider to be evaluated for TB. TB can be cured with antibiotics.
People who would like more information on this potential exposure should call:

Morse High School at (619) 725-5519
County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621

Tuberculosis is not uncommon in the region but has been decreasing since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years.
In 2013, a total of 206 cases were reported in the County, the lowest number since local TB cases peaked at 469 in 1993. There were 237 cases reported in 2017 and 226 in 2018.  Last year, 265 residents were diagnosed with TB. To date, 67 cases have been reported in 2020.

255,"Agriculture Blossoms Again in Annual Crop Report, Nears $1.8 Billion","Agriculture values blossomed for the third year out of the past four and grew close to $1.8 billion, a height they last reached in 2014, in the County of San Diego’s annual Crop Report.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/agriculture-blossoms-again-in-annual-crop-report-nears-1-8-billion/,2020-08-25T15:07:59-07:00,"
Agriculture values blossomed for the third year out of the past four and grew close to $1.8 billion, a height they last reached in 2014, in the County of San Diego’s annual Crop Report.
The value of all agriculture crops and commodities rose about 1.5% in the new Crop Report that covers the 2019 growing season, from $1,769,815,715 in 2018 to $1,795,528,573.
Total agriculture values also increased in the 2016 and 2017 reports, before slipping by one-quarter of 1% in last year’s 2018 report.
This year’s increase was fueled in large part by a 5.8% increase, from $322.9 million in 2018 to $341.7 million in 2019, in the overall values of Fruits and Nuts, a category that includes three of the Top 10 crops: avocados, lemons and oranges.
Ornamental Trees and Shrubs, which has been the top crop in San Diego County for the past 11 Crop Reports, since 2009, continued to increase in overall value, increasing by just .6%, but to $445,488,124, its highest total over that time.
The rest of the annual Top 10 crops remained similar to previous years, although some crop categories were changed slightly. For example, this year’s number two crop, Bedding Plants, Color & Herbaceous Perennials, like flowers and herbs, was combined with Cactuses & Succulents and had a total value of $399,028,516.
The third-ranked crop, Indoor Flowering & Foliage Plants earned a total value of $291,335,199. The fourth-ranked, and possibly San Diego’s most famous crop, Avocados, increased in value by nearly 16% and $19 million, from $121,038,020 in 2018 to $140,116,363.
The annual Crop Report is compiled by the County’s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures and can be seen online. The report provides a yearly snapshot of an industry that remains a staple of the region’s economy despite challenges like drought, rising water costs, fires, freezes and pests.
San Diego County’s Board of Supervisors has taken several actions in recent years to boost agriculture, including: creating a boutique winery ordinance to promote the creation of small wineries; approving a new beekeeping ordinance that allows more beekeeping while protecting the public; adopting an agricultural easement program that preserves agricultural space; streamlining regulations for things like cheese-making, agritourism and onsite horticultural sales.
Supervisor Jim Desmond’s Fifth District, home to a lot of the county’s agricultural land, said agriculture is an important part of the economy.
“Over the last year, we have seen how essential farming is in San Diego County,” Desmond said. “It is an honor to be the supervisor of District Five, which has a diverse variety of agricultural crops ranging from flowers to strawberries and avocados. I will continue to be a supporter of agriculture, which will always be essential to the region’s economy!”
Other interesting highlights from the 2019 Crop Report include:

The agriculture industry continues to do more with less, increasing in total value while working fewer acres. In 2019 total agriculture values increased 1.5% while reporting 234,477 acres in production. That was 3.3% fewer acres reported in 2018 and the fewest number of acres reported in production in 17 years — since 2002.
The increase to $140.1 million for Avocados, was that crop’s largest value since 2014.
One of the largest percentage increases was for “Field, other,” which included a relatively new crop, industrial hemp. The category increased a whopping 373% from $794,625 in 2018 to $3,760,517.
Wine Grapes saw its third year of double-digit percent increases, rising 21.5% from $4,591,032 in 2018 to $5,580,300. Wine Grapes became a trendy crop and soared by over 500% in 2012, two years after the Board of Supervisors approved the Boutique Winery Ordinance to promote the creation of small wineries.

256,San Diego County Adopts New Budget,The County Board of Supervisors adopted a $6.5 billion revised budget for fiscal year 2020-21 after public deliberations on Tuesday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-county-adopts-new-budget/,2020-08-26T12:32:16-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors adopted a $6.5 billion revised budget for fiscal year 2020-21 after public deliberations on Tuesday.
The adopted budget addresses the unexpected COVID-19 and economic crises, and also reflects calls for social justice and racial equality.
A $6.4 billion recommended budget was presented to the Board on Aug. 10 and called for an increase of $159 million or 2.5% over last year and $100 million to fight the COVID-19 public health crisis.
Supervisors approved additional spending on Tuesday, adding $140.1 million to the budget.
As a result, the revised $6.5 billion budget calls for an increase of $299.2 million or 4.8% over last year, an additional 24 employees for a total of 17,953.5 staff years.
The pandemic coupled with the economic downturn are slashing revenue at a time when costs are rapidly rising. Despite these challenges, the County is required by law to balance the budget.
To make up the shortfalls, the County will be dipping into its reserves for $ 277.3 million, $138.8 million this year and $138.5 million for 2021-22.
Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer told the Board dipping into reserves helps everyone get through the pandemic and come back on the other side with policies and programs that allow the County to bounce back stronger and better. But she cautioned the practice cannot become the norm and discipline will be required to fix the imbalance and replenish the reserves.
“We believe this spending plan is sound and reasonable for this time,” said Robbins-Meyer. “We will adjust as necessary and collectively we will combat COVID 19, navigate the economic downturn and begin to address the social justice and racial equity issues facing our region.”
Responding to COVID-19 remains the top priority. The new budget includes a $24 million increase for the COVID-19 Emergency Rental Assistance Program to expand the program countywide. Plus, $1 million for landlord/tenant counseling services.
Another $5 million will provide COVID-19 Testing, Tracing and Treatment activities for K-12 schools.
Also, $2 million will help families gain internet access so their children don’t fall behind in distance learning.
New funding sets aside $5.4 million to help the homeless at the San Diego Convention Center continue receiving on-site care after they move to new housing accommodations.
Another $2.5 million will go toward translation services to help the County share more information with those who do not speak English as their first language.
Additional funds of $5.9 million will launch a South Region Crisis Stabilization Unit at Paradise Valley Hospital and $5 million will boost countywide Mobile Crisis Response Teams.
Nearly $11 million will go toward a variety of traffic improvements including guardrails and traffic signals.
The revised budget also carries over proposals from the recommended budget below.
The Health and Human Services Agency will see an increase of $100 million to reduce the pandemic’s spread and allow for responsible reopening. The funding will go toward efforts tied to responding to COVID-19, including the Testing, Tracing and Treatment Strategy (T3), food distribution, medical supplies, personal protective equipment (PPE) and shelter.
Another $15 million will pay for technology needs to support behavioral health services, including: telehealth, electronic health record upgrades, outreach and engagement, workforce recruitment and retention.
The County is also providing a wide array of online services to customers that range from help for behavioral health issues, to permitting, to digital library books. Parks is offering virtual programs as well, including Movies in the Park.
The Registrar of Voters office is busy planning for the November presidential election but this time, needs to ensure it is conducted in the safest way possible during this pandemic.
While COVID-19 appears to overshadow many aspects of our lives, the County is still supporting vulnerable people.
To strengthen children and families, the County will continue to serve over 1 million San Diegans every month with Medi-Cal, CalFresh, CalWORKs and General Relief, and also help enroll low income families and others affected by the pandemic’s economic fallout. Child Welfare Services will expand upon efforts to strengthen families and address disproportionality and disparities. Seniors will be supported through efforts such as the Geriatric Emergency Department Accreditation program and Alzheimer’s awareness.
A $23.7 million increase will address homelessness in the unincorporated area and another $0.4 million will be used to develop a Flexible Housing Subsidy Pool in collaboration with the Regional Task Force on the Homeless to help move those experiencing homelessness into permanent housing.
A $3 million increase will help address homelessness among youth up to the age of 24, with a focus on youth transitioning from foster care and young parents experiencing homelessness. The Sheriff’s Homeless Assistance Resource Team (HART) will see a $2.6 million increase to expand its program.
In the area of behavioral health, the County continues to transform the multi-sectoral system of care from one driven by crisis, to one of continuous care and prevention, by providing coordinated resources to keep people connected, stable and healthy. This includes increased investments for diversionary services, such as the expansion of Crisis Stabilization Units, and increases to help community providers expand their capacity for long–term treatment. The County will also continue its partnership with UC San Diego Health to develop a behavioral health hub on County-owned property in Hillcrest.
Nationwide conversations are driving change in public safety. De-escalation training for law enforcement agencies is a priority to strengthen community trust, equity and racial justice. By the end of the year, nearly 3,000 officers are expected to complete training through the District Attorney’s office, with an additional 1,600 through the Sheriff’s Department. The Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board will have increased authority and expanded resources to provide independent oversight of the Sheriff’s Department and Probation.
The Board of Supervisors created a new Office of Equity and Racial Justice to examine bias within the County organization, which will also work with the newly formed Human Relations Commission. The Commission will collaborate with community organizations to address disparities and create more equitable programs, services and resources for all.
Plans are in the works to create the District Attorney North County Family Justice Center to further protect victims of crime. The County is also designing an earthquake early warning system pilot program and building two fire stations, one in Mt. Laguna and the other at Palomar Mountain.
The County is on track to nearly double the number of affordable housing units in its portfolio over five years to help low income, special needs and homeless residents using local, state and federal funds. Pre-approved plans, permit and impact fee waivers are available for the construction of granny flats or accessory dwelling units to help ease the affordable housing shortage.
The budget includes funds to protect and improve the region’s air quality, including $5.0 million for addressing vehicle emissions and $21.1 million to implement the Community Air Protection Program that continues to monitor air quality in communities most vulnerable to air pollution.
The capital program includes:

$22.3 million to enhance and renovate the Rock Mountain Detention Facility
$15.0 million for design and construction of Innovative Residential Rehabilitation Program
$14.9 million for multiple facilities major maintenance capital projects
$14 million for the Lakeside Equestrian Facility
$7.2 million for construction of Mt. Laguna and Palomar Mountain Fire Stations and planning of the East Otay Mesa Fire Station
$9.3 million for expansion and improvements at various County parks including Lincoln Acres Park expansion
$1.7 million for expansion and construction at the Rancho San Diego Library and Casa de Oro Library
$0.6 million for electric vehicle installation and improvements at County facilities

The Fiscal Year 2020-21 Capital Program also includes partial funding for the following capital projects:

$14.5 million for the County Administration Center (CAC) phased renovations
$7.5 million for North Coastal Live Well Health Center improvements
$2.0 million for planning the Third Avenue Mental Health Inpatient Facility Hub, Hillcrest
$2.0 million for the Edgemoor Psychiatric Unit
$0.4 million for the San Diego Juvenile Justice Campus (Phase II)

The budget plan is part of a two-year operational plan that will help determine how the County spends its resources. The first year of the plan for Fiscal Year 2020-21 was adopted Tuesday, the second year was approved in principle.
The new fiscal year budget is retroactive to July 1.

257,County Schools Could Reopen Sept. 1,"Given that the County’s case rate for COVID-19 has been and appears likely to remain below 100 cases per every 100,000 residents, all schools in the region, kindergarten through 12th grade, could reopen for in-person instruction beginning Sept. 1.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-county-schools-could-reopen-sept-1/,2020-08-26T17:37:07-07:00,"
Given that the County’s case rate for COVID-19 has been and appears likely to remain below 100 cases per every 100,000 residents, all schools in the region, kindergarten through 12th grade, could reopen for in-person instruction beginning Sept. 1.
Schools that choose to reopen must follow the guidance for schools and school-based programs. The guidance applies to in-person learning and distance learning.
“San Diegans have done a tremendous job in helping us to keep the local case rate below 100,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
Schools districts and charter and private schools must meet the state public health requirements and must develop and implement their own reopening plan.
“Ever since schools made the decision in March to close campuses to prevent the spread of COVID, we have been focused on creating plans to reopen safely,” said Superintendent Paul Gothold, San Diego County Office of Education. “All of us in education miss our school communities. This year is hard for educators and families alike, and back-to-school just hasn’t been the same.”
COVID-19 Testing for Students, Teachers
The County is getting about $20 million in state funds to expand COVID-19 testing and conduct more surveillance and contact tracing.
The California Department of Public Health recommends periodic surveillance testing for any school employees who may have contact with students or other staff.
Testing is available at over 20 County-coordinated sites. All are open to school personnel and youth over the age of 12. Most locations require appointments, but no appointment walk-in testing is offered at California State University San Marcos, Tubman-Chavez Community Center and the San Ysidro Border, and a drive-in site at Mar Vista High School in Imperial Beach. Specific testing information is available at 211SanDiego.org.
The San Diego County Office of Education is working with the County to open additional testing sites in late September that will be specifically for school staff.
“Given the diversity of our schools and the size of our county, the specifics of testing plans, timelines, and logistics will vary,” Gothold said. “What won’t vary is our commitment to ensuring healthy environments for our students and employees.”
County public health nurse administers a COVID-19 test.
Most students and their caregivers can receive COVID-19 tests through Rady Children’s Hospital. Parents should contact their pediatrician or e-mail Rady Children’s Hospital at covidcollaborative@rchsd.org.
Students and caregivers who are covered by Kaiser Permanente can consult their pediatrician or physician directly for guidance on COVID-19 testing by visiting www.kp.org.
Case Rate:

The region’s state-calculated case rate is 80.2 for Aug. 26.
The County will now need to report a case rate below 100 cases per 100,000 people for five more days. Then all schools, grades K-12, can reopen.
No other businesses can reopen until the state provides further guidance.

260,Congratulations to San Diego’s 25 Most Remarkable Teens,"Despite the pandemic’s interruption to schools this spring, the San Diego County Public Defender’s Office sought to recognize 25 students who excelled in a broad field of endeavors, including community, public safety and active citizenship.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/congratulations-to-san-diegos-25-most-remarkable-teens/,2020-08-28T16:29:20-07:00,"
Despite the pandemic’s interruption to schools this spring, the San Diego County Public Defender’s Office sought to recognize 25 students who excelled in a broad field of endeavors, including community, public safety and active citizenship.
“It was difficult choosing only 25 from all the amazing kids we interviewed, but it was also inspiring to hear their stories,” Public Defender Randy Mize said. “Gen Z teens are involved, informed and globally connected.  These kids are ready to fight fiercely for change in a world that is desperate for change. I can’t wait to see what they do.”
The Most Remarkable Teen program recognizes San Diego youth ages 13-19 for their contributions and efforts in 25 non-traditional categories including arts and culture, technology, civic involvement, leadership, courage to overcome adversity and other outstanding accomplishments, successes, and efforts.
The San Diego County Public Defender Youth Council, made up of high school students, and Mize interviewed nominees using videoconferencing and selected the 25 teens from 150 students nominated. The public defender said last year’s inaugural program was a success and they were thrilled to receive so many nominations since schools closed shortly after the nomination period opened.
Due to COVID-19, the Public Defender Attorney Advisors delivered Remarkable Teen award packets, including a crystal glass trophy, personalized yard sign and special commendations, to each recipient’s home this week.
The teens received a Certificate of Recognition from the Public Defender for the honor of being nominated. The teens also received personal commendations from San Diego County Board Chairman Greg Cox and Supervisor Nathan Fletcher and San Diego City Council President Pro Tem Barbara Bry, Councilmembers Monica Montgomery, Chris Ward and, who had previously committed to presenting the 2020 awards at the live event.
The 25 Teens honored by category are:

261,County Marks Overdose Awareness Day: “No one has to Die”,"Standing in front of 645 placards representing every person who died by accidental drug overdose in San Diego County last year, County and other officials said Monday these deaths did not have to happen — and no one else has to die.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-marks-overdose-awareness-day-no-one-has-to-die/,2020-08-31T13:17:05-07:00,"
Standing in front of 645 placards representing every person who died by accidental drug overdose in San Diego County last year, County and other officials said Monday these deaths did not have to happen — and no one else has to die.
County Supervisor Kristin Gaspar, County District Attorney Summer Stephan, County Behavioral Health Director Dr. Luke Bergmann, law enforcement, drug prevention and healthcare officials gathered at the County Administration Center Monday morning to commemorate International Overdose Awareness Day.
The annual global event was created in 2001 to raise awareness of overdose deaths, reduce the stigma attached to them and acknowledge the grief of victims’ families and friends.
Collectively, the speakers said overdose deaths were increasing locally and victims could be anyone of any ethnicity and background — mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, friends, rich, poor, old, young. They said law enforcement was crucial, but that society must collectively realize substance abuse disorder was a disease that can, and must, be beaten.
And they urged people to act, to get help by calling the County’s Access and Crisis line (1-888-724-7240) or 2-1-1 San Diego; to safely get rid of old prescription drugs at biannual Prescription Drug Take Back days or by taking them to local Sheriff’s offices and fire stations; and to learn more about the overdose crisis at the San Diego Opioid Project.
Gaspar called on parents to go to their medicine cabinets to get rid of old prescription drugs that children can get to.
“Immediately, first step,” Gaspar said, “look in your medicine cabinet. Anything in there, expired, unused meds — we need to make every day prescription (drug) takeback day in San Diego County. Those can go immediately to your Sheriff’s department … to a fire station, disposed of properly. They are dangerous.”
Stephan and others said overdose deaths plague San Diego County like the rest of the nation. She said fentanyl deaths in particular have become a rising problem, due in part to drug dealers “lacing” other various illegal drugs with deadly fentanyl. She said fentanyl-related deaths have increased in San Diego County from 152 in all of 2019, to 203 in just the first six months of 2020.
Dr. Bergmann said that the COVID 19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem because people who are stressed and turning to substance abuse feel disconnected from care. But he said advancements in telehealth means that anyone can get help, and he urged people who were struggling, or who had loved ones struggling with addiction issues to call.
“If you can get access to a phone,” Bergmann said, “you can get care. And there’s not a better day, I would say, to begin a recovery journey than today.”
Some of the other comments from Monday’s speakers included:

Gaspar said she strongly supported the Methamphetamine Strike Force and Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force initiatives, and that the County’s new $6.5 billion budget directed $100 million to address COVID and all its impacts. Gaspar said that included an additional $15 million for technology needed for behavioral health such as telehealth, outreach and engagement, and workforce recruitment and retention.
US Attorney Robert Brewer Jr. said federal law enforcement was doing everything in its power to disrupt and dismantle drug traffickers and their networks. But he added “we can’t enforce and incarcerate our way out of this supply-demand-addiction cycle.” Brewer said partnerships between state, local and community agencies and groups were critical and urged everyone to work together to “hammer home” the message that overdose is preventable and drug addiction is a treatable disease.
Stephan said the District Attorney’s Office prosecutes drug dealers but also protects the public through awareness and outreach through initiatives like the Opioid Project.
Bergmann said people can and do recover from substance abuse disorder. He said the County Health and Human Services Agency provides services and help to more than 111,000 county residents of all ages. Bergmann said the County’s nine programs work with justice partners hospitals, community health centers and other community-based providers to improve, expand and introduce new methods to help those in need.

The most poignant comments came from Pam Summerfruit, who identified herself simply as “the parent of an overdose drug victim.”
Summerfruit said that a week before Thanksgiving in 2016 her 26-year-old son died of a fentanyl overdose after taking an illegally obtained dose of what he thought was Percocet, a pain medication. Summerfruit said her son’s dealer pleaded guilty and was sentenced for manslaughter. But her son is still gone.
“We’re left,” Summerfruit said, “like so many other families, to remember our loved ones and to act by spreading the word on this international Overdose Awareness Day that overdose death is preventable.”

262,"Some Indoor Restrictions Lifted, Businesses Must Follow Guidelines",The County is asking businesses and organizations allowed to reopen indoor operations under new state guidance to review and redo their safe reopening plans to ensure they stay in compliance.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/some-indoor-restrictions-lifted-businesses-must-follow-guidelines/,2020-08-31T18:16:05-07:00,"
The County is asking businesses and organizations allowed to reopen indoor operations under new state guidance to review and redo their safe reopening plans to ensure they stay in compliance.
The state introduced a new tiered system Friday that allows certain indoor activities to resume in San Diego County as early as today. However, businesses must adhere to industry-specific guidelines and follow hygiene, social distancing and face covering requirements.
While many sectors can reopen, not all can operate at full capacity. Gyms and fitness centers can operate indoors but must limit attendance to 10% capacity or less.
Restaurants can open indoor dining but must limit indoor operations to 25% capacity or 100 people, whichever is lower. Places of worship and movie theaters can operate indoors under those same capacity limits. Museums can open at 25% capacity.
Hair salons, barber shops and nail salons can operate indoors at full capacity but must follow safety precautions outlined by the state and county.
“Under the latest health order, businesses will be required to implement a sign-in procedure, collecting contact information for patrons served indoors,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This process will assist disease investigators in case an outbreak is traced to a particular business.”
Businesses can find the guidelines that apply to their industry on the state’s COVID-19 website. Business owners can also email the county with specific questions about reopening guidance for their sector.
New State Metrics
Under the new state monitoring metrics, San Diego County is currently in Tier 2, also referred to as the Red Tier. That’s the second-most-restrictive of four total tiers outlined by the state, indicating that transmission of the virus is substantial.
Tiers are based on two metrics, case rate and the percentage of positive tests. To remain in the Red Tier, or Tier 2, the county will have to report between four to seven COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents per day and a positivity rate between 5%-8%.
San Diego’s state-calculated case rate is currently 5.8 and the testing positivity percentage is 3.8%.
To move to the next lower-risk tier, the County will have to report between 1-3.9 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents per day and a positivity rate between 2-4.9% for at least two consecutive weeks.
The state will assess counties on a weekly basis, with the next report scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 8. Counties can only move one tier at a time and must wait at least 21 days between moves.
“To maintain our current status or to move to a less restrictive tier, we need continued support from the community,” Wooten said. “We must build on our success and continue to focus on protecting one another.”
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Two new outbreaks were identified on Aug. 30, one in a restaurant/bar and one in a business setting.
In the past seven days, 16 community outbreaks were identified.

264,County Works with SDSU to Address Rising Cases on Campus,The County is working with San Diego State University to respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases in students who are enrolled in classes at the university. Since the beginning of the fall semester on Aug.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-works-with-sdsu-to-address-rising-cases-on-campus/,2020-09-02T19:07:26-07:00,"
The County is working with San Diego State University to respond to a spike in COVID-19 cases in students who are enrolled in classes at the university. Since the beginning of the fall semester on Aug. 24, the university has reported 64 confirmed and probable cases in students who live on and off campus.
The County is collaborating with university officials to mitigate the situation.
“We do expect more cases so what’s important is how we respond,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., medical director of the County Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch. “I’m very pleased with the working relationship we have with SDSU. The information our disease investigators are gathering, in addition to what campus officials are providing, really allows us to paint a complete picture and I am particularly impressed with the cooperation of the students.”


McDonald said the 64 cases among the student population do not constitute a single large outbreak. Ten of the 64 reported cases live in the same location, an off-campus housing facility. Other cases may be linked epidemiologically, but these groups of cases are not directly related to each other, and some cases are known to be related to exposures outside the county.


Students who have tested positive for the virus are isolating away from their peers, either in on-campus housing units set aside for this purpose or in County public health rooms.
Expanded Testing On Campus
The County is currently assisting with testing on campus and will partner with the university to expand testing capacity in the coming days. The university houses one of the County’s busiest drive-up test sites and starting today, capacity at that site will expand to 350 tests a day.
The testing site is located at 6200 Alvarado Road and beginning Sept. 8, the site will become a walk-up site with no appointments required to get tested for COVID-19.
COVID-19 and Young People
The rise in cases at SDSU is in line with a trend the County has been reporting on throughout the summer. The number of young people who test positive for COVID-19 has been steadily increasing, especially since businesses started to reopen in July.
Of the more than 39,000 COVID-19 cases reported in the region, San Diegans between 20 and 39 years of age represent more than 44% of all cases.
Since the state uses the county’s case rate and testing positivity numbers to determine which sectors of the economy can reopen and to what extent, it is important that San Diegans follow public health orders which are designed to minimize the spread of the virus.
“The actions we take now will have an impact on our numbers in the coming weeks,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We don’t want to slip back into a more restrictive tier, so we urge the public to stay the course, avoid social gatherings and practice good hygiene.”
New State Metrics:

Under the new state monitoring metrics, San Diego County is currently in Tier 2, also referred to as the Red Tier.
San Diego County’s state-calculated case rate is 5.8 and the testing positivity percentage is 3.8%.
The state will assess counties on a weekly basis, with the next report scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 8.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

Three new outbreaks were confirmed on Sept. 1, two in restaurant/bars and one in a residence.
In the past seven days, 18 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.

 Testing:

265,COVID-19 Won’t Take Labor Day Off,"Memorial Day came. People felt they needed to celebrate. As a result, COVID-19 cases rose dramatically in the following weeks.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-wont-take-labor-day-off/,2020-09-04T10:16:22-07:00,"
Memorial Day came. People felt they needed to celebrate. As a result, COVID-19 cases rose dramatically in the following weeks.
Restaurants, gyms and other businesses reopened in mid-June and the same thing happened. Fourth of July came and went, and the local case count remained high. Ordered by the state, businesses closed indoor activities and cases went down.
With Labor Day right around the corner and some businesses reopened, County health officials are asking residents to please take the recommended precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
“Most people won’t be working over the long holiday period, but COVID-19 will not be taking the day off,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The more people go out and the more they interact with people outside their household, the more likely they are to contract the virus.”
San Diegans should take the following precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19:

Don’t host or attend private holiday parties.
Avoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.
Maintain physical distance from others.
If you need to be in public, you must use a face covering if you are close to people outside your household. The coverings help prevent asymptomatic carriers of the virus from spreading it.
If you’re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.
Wash your hands properly and regularly or use a hand sanitizer.
If you’re out and about and notice that a business is not following the health guidance, report them to your local police department by calling the non-emergency number.

“During normal times, people feel the need to get together with family and friends on holiday weekends,” Wooten said. “But these are not normal times and indoor gathering and celebrations increase the possibility of COVID-19 spread.”
The only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is with San Diegans’ help and cooperation. That’s what helped the County get off the state’s County Monitoring List and placed it in Tier 2 of the state’s new system of measuring risk.
“We need to continue protecting ourselves and others to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Wooten said. “We must do all we can to keep our county from taking a step back because that would force businesses that just reopened to close again.”
COVID-19 Testing Labor Day Weekend
COVID-19 testing will be available throughout the weekend and on Labor Day. Appointments are necessary for most County testing sites.
Testing on Labor Day will be limited to three County sites that do not require an appointment. Walk-in testing will take place at Tubman Chavez Center and CSU San Marcos from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., while the San Ysidro Border site will be open its regular hours of 6:30 a.m. to noon.

266,"SDSU Cases Jump, Students Need to Stay Home","With the Labor Day weekend beginning, the County of San Diego is reporting 120 additional confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases among San Diego State University’s undergraduate students, bringing the total number of cases at SDSU to 184 since Aug. 24.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/sdsu-cases-jump-students-need-to-stay-home/,2020-09-04T15:58:57-07:00,"
With the Labor Day weekend beginning, the County of San Diego is reporting 120 additional confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases among San Diego State University’s undergraduate students, bringing the total number of cases at SDSU to 184 since Aug. 24.
The number of cases includes multiple suspected outbreaks involving students living both on and off campus and is expected to increase. County health officials want students to remain in place this weekend to prevent the virus from spreading.
“SDSU undergrads need to stay home within their living units this weekend,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We need your help to stop the spread within your campus community and our larger community. If you have been to parties and social events, you need to get tested, now. And quarantine yourself until you get results.”
None of the cases under investigation are related to on-campus educational activities, including classes or labs. They involve 14 distinct groups that have so far been identified within housing and gathering locations. Some of these groups may be determined to be outbreaks.
County epidemiology teams continue to conduct on-site investigations of suspected outbreaks and speak personally with students.
All members of the SDSU undergraduate community who have attended gatherings or think they may have been exposed to the virus are urged to follow public health best practices. Those include:

Avoiding parties and gatherings outside the household
Wearing face coverings
Social distancing
Practicing good hygiene

The County is reporting 453 positive cases today, the most since 551 were reported on Aug. 7. Even without the SDSU cases, the number of cases is concerning, particularly since most of the infections took place before the most recent reopening of certain activities.
“This news is a reminder that we all have a role in keeping the infection rate down,” said Dr. Wooten. “I’m asking San Diegans to take a look at their individual actions and, if necessary, adjust their behaviors to help ensure we remain safe and moving in the right direction.”

267,Safari Park Visitor Potentially Exposed to Rabies,Sept. 8 Update: The park guest seen near the bat has been identified. Any other visitors who may have come in direct contact with a bat at the location and time described below should contact County Health and Human Services.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/safari-park-visitor-potentially-exposed-to-rabies/,2020-09-07T13:14:18-07:00,"
Sept. 8 Update: The park guest seen near the bat has been identified. Any other visitors who may have come in direct contact with a bat at the location and time described below should contact County Health and Human Services. 
 
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is asking for the public’s help in identifying one person, and possibly others, who may have been exposed to rabies while visiting San Diego Zoo Safari Park in San Pasqual on Sunday, Sept. 6.
A bat was witnessed flying around an unidentified female guest at 11:30 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 6, at the Mombasa Cooker at Nairobi Village. It was later collected by a trained park employee and submitted to the County for rabies testing, and the County Public Health Laboratory confirmed the bat was infected with rabies. The bat was not one of the park’s collection animals.
The woman and another person who may also have had direct contact with the bat left before providing contact information. Anyone who knows the identity of these park visitors, or anyone who was at the park and believes they were potentially exposed to the bat, is urged to contact the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency as soon as possible at (619) 692-8499.
“We are concerned about the health of this woman and any park patrons who were in direct contact with the bat,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., medical director of the County Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch. “We want to make sure they were not potentially exposed to this deadly disease.”
Health officials would like to interview anyone who may have come in contact with the bat as soon as possible to determine if they were potentially exposed to rabies. Park visitors who had no physical contact with the bat are not at risk for rabies.
There have been five rabid bats detected by the County in 2020, and the public is reminded to never handle any bat due to the possible risk of rabies.  Rabies is a preventable viral disease that is most often transmitted through the bite of a rabid animal. Although rare, transmission may also occur if the saliva from a rabid animal comes in contact with a person’s eyes, nose, mouth or open wound.
Symptoms of rabies in people can take weeks to months to develop after exposure to a rabid animal has occurred. Once symptoms develop, rabies is almost always fatal. However, prompt post-exposure treatment following exposure to the virus will prevent the disease.
For more information about rabies and bats, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website.

If you are an active registered voter, you can now sign up to track the status of your mail ballot ­ – when the ballot is mailed to you, when the Registrar of Voters gets it back from you in the mail and when it is counted.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, every active registered voter in California will receive a ballot in the mail for the Nov. 3, 2020, Presidential General Election.
The ballot tracking tool is new. Voters can sign up for Where’s My Ballot? at sdvote.com to receive automatic email, text, or call notification on the status of their ballot.
It’s also a good idea for voters to double-check their registration in the next couple of weeks to make sure the Registrar of Voters sends the mail ballot to the correct address.

Check your registration information. Make sure your residence and, if different, your mailing address is up to date.
Have you moved or changed your name? Whether you are new to San Diego County or just moved down the street you need to re-register to vote.
Are you a first-time voter? Register to vote – it takes less than two minutes.

The Registrar of Voters office will be preparing ballots for the mail by mid-September, and ballots will start going out to registered voters the week of Oct. 5. If your voter information is up to date you should expect to receive your ballot the same week.
Voting by mail is simple, safer, and secure. The Registrar of Voters has launched an awareness campaign, Vote Safer San Diego, to educate the public on the safety, security and ease of voting in the upcoming election amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Those who want to vote in person will still have the opportunity to do so, but they may run into long lines, both at the polls and the Registrar’s office.

269,Residents Urged to Be Prepared to Evacuate Early and Quickly as Fire Threat Increases,"The Valley Fire, which has grown to thousands of acres in just a few days, is a growing threat to communities in San Diego County with the Santa Ana wind event forecast for today. Residents, particularly those who live in communities around the fire perimeter, are asked to be ready to evacuate in 15 minutes or less.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/residents-urged-to-be-prepared-to-evacuate-early-and-quickly-as-fire-threat-increases/,2020-09-08T11:49:18-07:00,"
The Valley Fire, which has grown to thousands of acres in just a few days, is a growing threat to communities in San Diego County with the Santa Ana wind event forecast for today. Residents, particularly those who live in communities around the fire perimeter, are asked to be ready to evacuate in 15 minutes or less.
Santa Ana winds are projected, at this point, to pick up in the evening hours, so it is important that residents be ready to go before then. In some previous fires, residents have been given less than 15 minutes to evacuate and were alerted in the overnight hours.
“We want to remind people to get prepared to evacuate in case it is needed and stay alert to the weather conditions, news and notifications from officials. This is an active fire and it can change directions and intensity depending on weather, so it’s important to take warnings and orders seriously,” said Jeff Toney, Director of the Office of Emergency Services. “We also want people to know that if they do not feel safe, they can evacuate early. People do not need to, and should not, wait for an official evacuation order.”
This is the fire evacuation warning and order and fire perimeter map as of 8 a.m. Sept. 8.

Be sure your cell phone is registered with AlertSanDiego, the county’s regional notification system to receive the warnings directly to your mobile phone. People may also register their VoIP phone numbers or emails as well.
Residents may also download the ReadySanDiego SDEmergencyApp which also provides emergency information such as incident updates, shelter locations, evacuation areas and hazard perimeters.
Tune in to local news coverage on the fire. The main Emergency Alert System radio stations for San Diego County are KOGO AM 600 and KLSD AM 1360.
Now is the time for households to review, or create, a personal disaster plan in English or in Spanish. The guide includes disaster preparedness and immediate safety tips that can be used in any emergency. Among the tips are what you need to know about evacuations and suggestions on what you can take with you. Residents may also consider various routes to take to leave the community, know more than one in case one is not safe to use due to the emergency.
Check on elderly or neighbors who might require assistance evacuating.
Have a plan to shelter large animals or livestock and if possible, evacuate them early. If you need assistance evacuating call (619) 236-2341.
Take household pets with you whenever possible.
If you have a life-threatening emergency, call 9-1-1.

272,County Case Rate Increasing; Could Move to Lower Tier,"The case rate for the region increased in the past week, placing the County at risk of dropping to Tier 1, the highest-risk level.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-case-rate-increasing-could-move-to-lower-tier/,2020-09-09T17:48:40-07:00,"
The case rate for the region increased in the past week, placing the County at risk of dropping to Tier 1, the highest-risk level.
The region’s case rate rose to 6.9 cases per 100,000 residents after entering the state’s new monitoring system with a 5.8 case rate and being placed in Tier 2, also known as Red Tier.
Should the case rate continue to increase, the County could be moved to Tier 1, or Purple, which carries more restrictive COVID-19 measures.
“San Diegans should continue taking the necessary measures to keep COVID-19 from spreading and the case rate from increasing,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
Tier placement is also based on each County’s percentage of tests coming back positive for COVID-19.
The positivity rate also increased from 3.4 to 4.2%, but still well below the state’s goal of 8% or less.
Should the County positivity rate hit 8% and the case rate continue to increase to more than seven cases per 100,000 residents for two consecutive weeks, the region would have to be moved to the Purple Tier.
For those counties not testing their residents at the same rate as the state, new adjustment factors have been added, potentially increasing a region’s case rate. Counties that are testing above the state’s rate have had their case rates scaled down.
Based on the state’s testing data from the County, the region’s case rate is at 7.9 per 100,000 residents, but the region did not get penalized because the state has been having issues, going back several months, that prevent it from getting the County’s correct testing numbers.
“We’re working with the state to resolve the issue,” Wooten said. “Currently, the state has indicated that they will use the County’s data to calculate the case rate and positivity percentage over the next several weeks.”
Should the County’s case rate drop to under 3.9 for a consecutive two weeks, it would qualify to move into Tier 3, or Orange Tier. The region’s positivity percentage has been under 4.9% for over two weeks and would allow the region to move to the higher, less-restrictive Tier 3. However, both metrics will need to qualify for the Orange Tier for two weeks before the County could move into it.
The state will assess counties on a weekly basis, with the next report scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 15.

273,County Board Ratifies Valley Fire Emergency Proclamation,"The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to ratify the County’s local emergency proclamation issued Sept. 6 for the Valley Fire due to the fire threat and damage, including the loss of at least 20 structures.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-board-ratifies-valley-fire-emergency-proclamation/,2020-09-09T17:50:49-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to ratify the County’s local emergency proclamation issued Sept. 6 for the Valley Fire due to the fire threat and damage, including the loss of at least 20 structures.
The proclamation will cover damage in the unincorporated area and will help make the region eligible for potential federal and state resources. These resources could help repair roadways, public infrastructure and cover emergency response costs.
Governor Gavin Newsom proclaimed a state of emergency on Sept. 3 for a number of fires burning in the state including the Valley Fire in San Diego County. In doing so, it opens up additional resources to assist in fighting the fire and recovery efforts.
The Valley Fire started just after 4 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 5 off Japatul Road and Carveacre Road, southeast of Alpine. As of Wednesday at 6:45 p.m., CAL FIRE reported the fire was 17,665 acres and 27 percent contained.  Damage inspections are ongoing but to date, 20 structures have been confirmed to be destroyed.
San Diego County Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Holly Porter said a swift and well-resourced response from CAL FIRE held the fire within the containment lines during a forecasted wind event Tuesday and prevented further destruction.
San Diego County Supervisor Dianne Jacob commented that the fire could have been much worse if not for CAL FIRE and “phenomenal” aerial support. She noted however that the area was not yet out of the woods because it is not fully contained.
The County of San Diego added information at its SDCountyRecovery.com site and has established a Recovery Hotline at (859) 715-2200 and an email to help those affected by the Valley Fire. The hotline and emails will be answered from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and through the upcoming weekend.

275,Suicides Dropped in San Diego County Last Year,"The number of people who died from suicide in the region dropped last year, according to the San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council’s 2020 Report to the Community released Thursday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/suicides-dropped-in-san-diego-county-last-year/,2020-09-10T13:15:54-07:00,"
The number of people who died from suicide in the region dropped last year, according to the San Diego County Suicide Prevention Council’s 2020 Report to the Community released Thursday.
In 2019, there were 429 deaths by suicide, 36 fewer than the 465 reported in 2018.
The annual report provides a comprehensive look at suicide in the region and brings together data from multiple sources for the years 2015 through 2019.
Other findings in the report include:

Suicide rate per 100,000 population: 12.8 in 2019 compared to 13.9 in 2018. The 2019 suicide rate for the state was 11.0 and 14.5 for the nation.
Emergency department discharges due to self-inflicted injury increased slightly to 3,163 in 2018, the most recent year available, compared to 3,091 in 2017.
The percentage of suicide crisis calls, as opposed to calls about other mental health issues, to the County’s Access and Crisis Line saw an increase from 47.6% in 2018 to 55.05% in 2019.

The great majority of people who die by suicide show warning signs. Knowing how to spot them and what you can do may help save a life.
To help curb suicide in San Diego, the County has several ongoing prevention efforts, including the It’s Up to Us campaign; the annual Check Your Mood Day; Question, Persuade and Refer trainings; and the Access and Crisis Line, a confidential counseling and referral hotline for people who feel overwhelmed or are experiencing a mental health crisis.
If you or someone you know needs help, call the Access & Crisis Line at 888-724-7240, seven days a week/24 hrs. a day and multiple languages available.

276,DA Warns that Spiking Prices or Contracting without a License During Valley Fire is a Crime,San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan is warning businesses and scammers not to take advantage of consumers by price gouging during a state of an emergency – doing so can end in prosecution.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/da-warns-that-spiking-prices-or-contracting-without-a-license-during-valley-fire-is-a-crime/,2020-09-11T14:26:37-07:00,"
San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan is warning businesses and scammers not to take advantage of consumers by price gouging during a state of an emergency – doing so can end in prosecution.
As a result of the devastating Valley fire in the eastern part of San Diego County, Governor Gavin Newsom and the San Diego County Board of Supervisors declared a state of emergency in San Diego County on September 6. During a declared state of emergency, it is illegal for a business to increase its prices for essential goods or services by more than 10 percent, unless they can show their own costs have been increased.
“Wildfires leave a devastating effect on many of our neighbors and we want to send a clear message that we will not tolerate any unlawful activity by a greedy businesses, contractors or scammers who would seek to financially exploit victims of wildfires,” Stephan said. “Price gouging and unlicensed contracting during a state of emergency is not only a crime, it also can further victimize someone who may have lost everything in a wildfire.”
Violations of the price gouging statute are subject to criminal prosecution that can result in one-year imprisonment in county jail and/or a fine of up to $10,000. Violations are also subject to civil enforcement actions including civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation, injunctive relief and mandatory restitution.
The law applies to several products and necessities including: food and drink (including food and drink for animals); emergency supplies such as water, flashlights, radios, batteries, candles, blankets, soaps, diapers, toiletries; and building materials, medical supplies such as prescription and nonprescription medications, bandages, gauze, isopropyl alcohol, and antibacterial products.
It is also a misdemeanor for a hotel or motel to increase regular rates by more than 10 percent during a declared emergency and for the 30 days following the state of emergency.
Anyone should be extremely cautious if approached by aggressive agents, adjusters or contractors after a disaster. Most businesses are honest and have good intentions, but there are always bad actors waiting to take advantage of disaster victims.
Working as an unlicensed contractor during a state of emergency is a felony. Keep these tips in mind when selecting a contractor:

Ask for proof of licensing such as a pocket license and a second photo ID.
Always verify that the license number matches the contractor you are dealing with.
Beware of scare tactics, odd calls or unsolicited contacts.
Make sure the contractor carries workers’ compensation and liability insurance.

In the aftermath of natural disasters, debris-clearing scams often surface. Do not provide payment upfront and be sure to ask where the debris is being taken. Scammers often ask for money up-front and then disappear. Sometimes they dump debris on a neighbor’s property or park, which may cause you to be responsible for the costs and penalties.
Investigators from the District Attorney’s Office are assisting inspectors with the County Department of Environmental Health in checking properties that have been impacted by the Valley Fire for environmental hazards prior to residents returning to their property.
The District Attorney’s Office has historically played a role in incidents of wildfires, including the San Diego County wildfires of 2003, 2007 and 2014. During those events, investigators from the District Attorney’s Office, the California Department of Insurance, the Contractors State License Board, and the Department of Motor Vehicles fanned out over fire-ravaged areas to warn homeowners to beware of would-be criminals who prey on victims of natural disasters. They posted signs warning unlicensed contractors that operating in a declared state of emergency area is a felony. Our investigators expect to do so again, once the fire is contained.

277,"County to Offer Rotating, COVID-19 Testing at Mexican Consulate, Other Locations","Starting Sept. 14, San Diegans wishing to get a COVID-19 test have a new option:  the Mexican Consulate in Little Italy.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-offer-rotating-covid-19-testing-at-mexican-consulate-other-locations/,2020-09-11T14:47:40-07:00,"
Starting Sept. 14, San Diegans wishing to get a COVID-19 test have a new option:  the Mexican Consulate in Little Italy.
Each Monday, the County will offer free, no-appointment tests from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.  on the patio of the Mexican Consulate, located at 1549 India St. in San Diego.
“The Consulate is proud to be part of the efforts to encourage testing and diagnosis among the Latino community,” said Mexican Consul Carlos González Gutiérrez at a news conference in Little Italy. “We know that part of what is necessary for our community to reach out to testing sites is for them to feel safe and understand that they can access public health services regardless of their migratory status.”
The Mexican Consulate site will officially kick off a 14-day rotating program of COVID-19 testing in hard-hit communities, including those with larger Latino and immigrant populations. Other locations to be announced next week will be in community and faith-based organizations that are helping the County with its testing efforts.
(l-r) Nancy Maldonado from the Chicano Federation, Sup. Nathan Fletcher, Mexican Consul González Gutiérrez, Barbara Jiménez and Nich Macchione, HHSA director.
“I am confident that the testing at this trusted location will allow us to reach a very important population,” said Barbara Jiménez, general manager of the Central and South regions of the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Until we have a widely available vaccine, testing will remain an absolutely critical part of our public health response.”
The first new site at the Consulate is one of seven locations throughout the region that offer free COVID-19 tests without an appointment.
The other six sites are located at:

California State University San Marcos – Viasat Engineering Pavilion
University of San Diego Parking Lot (Moving to a building on Tuesday, Sept. 15.)
San Diego State University Parking Lot 17-B (Moving to the Alumni Center on Monday, Sept. 14.)
Tubman-Chavez Community Center
Mar Vista High School (Drive-up site)
San Ysidro Port of Entry PedEast

282,County to Remain in Red Tier,"After being on the brink of falling into the most restrictive Purple Tier, the County will remain in Tier Two, or the Red Tier, of the state’s system of assessing COVID-19 risk, the state announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-remain-in-red-tier/,2020-09-22T18:33:59-07:00,"
After being on the brink of falling into the most restrictive Purple Tier, the County will remain in Tier Two, or the Red Tier, of the state’s system of assessing COVID-19 risk, the state announced today. The change means indoor activities that recently reopened can continue for at least two more weeks.
The County’s adjusted case rate dropped from 8.1 (unadjusted 7.9) to 6.9 per 100,000 and is now below the Red Tier maximum of 7.0, allowing it to remain in that tier of the state’s reopening plan. The figures used to calculate this new rate are from Sept. 6 through Sept. 12.
“It is because of the efforts of most San Diegans that the County is able to remain in the Red Tier,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The only way for the case rate to continue going down is if all local residents take the necessary precautions to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19.”
The region will now remain in the Red Tier for at least 14 days but could drop to the Purple Tier if the local case rate goes above 7.0 per 100,000 residents for two consecutive weeks. It would take three weeks for the County to be able to move to Tier 3 or the Orange Tier but not before driving its case rate down below 3.9 cases per 100,000 residents for 14 consecutive days.
Reopening tiers are based on a county’s case rate and testing positivity percentage. The County’s positivity percentage, now 3.8%, has been below the 4.9% that qualifies it for the Orange Tier since the state adopted the new ranking system. However, the state goes with the more restrictive measure to assign tiers.
The California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis, and the next report is scheduled for Tuesday, Sept. 29.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

One new community outbreak was confirmed on Sept. 21 in a business setting.
In the past seven days (Sept. 15 through Sept. 21), 18 community outbreaks were confirmed.

285,"3 San Diegans Die Daily from Opioid, Other Drug Overdoses","Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, rates of drug related overdose deaths in San Diego County have increased. In July and August numbers of overdose deaths were more than 50% higher than in February and March of 2020, with an average of about three people dying per day in the County.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/3-san-diegans-die-daily-from-opioid-other-drug-overdoses/,2020-09-25T16:03:34-07:00,"
Since the onset of the COVID pandemic, rates of drug related overdose deaths in San Diego County have increased. In July and August numbers of overdose deaths were more than 50% higher than in February and March of 2020, with an average of about three people dying per day in the County.
County health officials are warning San Diegans of the dangers of using drugs and encouraging them to know what do to when an overdose occurs.
If you suspect someone has overdosed, the first thing to do is call 9-1-1. But when an overdose occurs and you are present, there is something else you can do: administer naloxone.
What is naloxone?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), drug overdose continues to be the main cause of death among drug users.
Data from the CDC shows that in 2018, a total of 67,367 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States. Opioids were involved in 46,802 overdose deaths in that same year, and two out of three opioid-involved overdose deaths involve synthetic opioids. 
The problem appears to be getting worse. Preliminary data from the CDC show that rates of drug overdose death in 2019 were not only higher than in 2018, but around 5% higher than in 2017, which had been a record year for overdose deaths during the country’s ongoing opioid epidemic.
Given the opioid epidemic in the nation, many states across the U.S., including California, now have laws that allow pharmacists to dispense naloxone without a prescription.
Naloxone is a potent life-saving medication that can rapidly reverse the effects of an opioid overdose and naloxone is available in many local pharmacies in San Diego County.
“If you spend time with someone who uses drugs or are a drug user, the County strongly encourages you to carry naloxone with you,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency.

Fentanyl Killing San Diegans
Bergmann in particular warned the public about illicit drugs in San Diego County being laced with the highly potent and often deadly drug fentanyl. According to local law enforcement, fentanyl can be found in all illicit drugs, including pills and powders sold as cocaine.
“Given the presence of fentanyl in local drug supplies, San Diegans should avoid drugs purchased from the streets,” said Bergmann. “But if you’re using illicit drugs or pharmaceutical medications that weren’t prescribed to you by a doctor, make sure there is someone with naloxone nearby to administer it in case you overdose.”
In 2019, San Diego County recorded 152 fentanyl-related overdose deaths. Through the first week of August of this year, 233 fentanyl-related deaths have already been noted. The deaths this year are nearly three times the 79 deaths that occurred at the same time last year due to fentanyl toxicity.
Current local trends in fentanyl overdose deaths may be compounded by stressors related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including restricted access to care, disruptions in usual drug supply routes and economic stressors leading to increased drug misuse.
County health officials have asked the local medical community to increase access to naloxone to prevent fentanyl-related deaths. They’ve also stressed that medication assisted treatment, such as methadone and buprenorphine, is the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder and is recommended to reduce the risk of overdose.
Drug Treatment Works
The County has inpatient and outpatient treatment services available throughout the region that can help San Diegans with substance use disorders.
“People can and do recover from substance use disorder,” Bergmann said. “If you can get access to a phone, you can get access to treatment.”
People seeking help should call the San Diego County Access and Crisis Line 888-724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego. Both resources are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

289,"It’s Still Hot Out, but Winter’s Coming; Time to Get Discounted Rain Barrels","It’s still hot outside but fall officially arrived last week — and that means our winter rainy season is just around the corner. It also means this is the perfect time to get a discounted rain barrel for as little as $25, thanks to the County and the nonprofit Solana Center.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/its-still-hot-out-but-winters-coming-time-to-get-discounted-rain-barrels/,2020-09-28T08:48:40-07:00,"
It’s still hot outside but fall officially arrived last week — and that means our winter rainy season is just around the corner.
It also means this is the perfect time to get a discounted rain barrel for as little as $25 to catch every drop, cut your gardening water-costs and protect our beaches simultaneously.
Thanks to the County of San Diego’s Watershed Protection Program and the nonprofit Solana Center, you can order a top-of-the-line, discounted $90 Ivy rain barrel right online.
And your total cost could be as low as $25 if you qualify for an additional Metropolitan Water District rebate and a separate County discount.
Here’s how to do it. Just order an Ivy rain barrel online at the Solana Center’s website and choose to pick it up at one of two COVID-protected events: Saturday, Oct. 24 in El Cajon or Saturday, Nov. 7 in Valley Center.
The rain barrels will not be shipped. Order your rain barrel by Oct. 18 to pick it up from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 24 at the Water Conservation Garden at 12122 Cuyamaca College Drive in El Cajon.
Order by Oct. 31 to pick your barrel up from 9 a.m. to noon Saturday, Nov. 7 at Bates Nut Farm at 15954 Woods Valley Road in Valley Center.
To protect everyone, customers must wear masks and remain in their cars. Workers at the events will also wear masks and load rain barrels into people’s trunks or back seats. There will be also be a staging area separated from the pickup spot for customers who need to adjust tie-downs or take other measures to secure rain barrels. A fuller explanation of the pickup process is located on the Solana Center’s webpage. 
If you can’t make either pickup event, you can also pick up your barrel from noon to 5 p.m. on Thursdays and from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays at the Solana Center’s Encinitas offices at 137 N. El Camino Real.
County residents can apply for a $35 rebate that can shrink their rain barrel’s cost from $90 to $55 if they get their water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California — either through the San Diego County Water Authority or its participating member agencies in San Diego County.
In addition, the County of San Diego is giving out its own $30 discount to residents who live in unincorporated areas — on the first 200 rain barrels ordered. Get that and your final cost shrinks to just $25!
Having a rain barrel can let you “harvest” rain right off your roof and use it to keep your gardens or lawns green the old-fashioned way. That can cut your water costs and even help protect our local beaches by preventing excess rain from washing pollution off our roofs and yards, and down our streets to the ocean.
The Ivy Rain Barrels have a locking, child-proof lid, are made of 100% recycled material, have overflow ports, protective screening to keep mosquitoes out, a ¾-inch ball valve to connect to your garden hose or to another barrel, and they don’t need pumps because they use gravity to dispense their collected rainwater.
Getting your discounted rain barrel is as easy as one, two, three.
One, order your barrel. Two, apply for your rebate(s). Three, go pick up your barrel.
Order and buy your barrel
Go to the County/Solana Center’s rain barrels website. Scroll halfway down the page and click on one of the two options to start your purchase:

“Check address & Start Purchase” (to buy a $60 barrel if you live in the Unincorporated County)
“Start Purchase” (to buy a $90 barrel if you’re a resident living in an incorporated city.)

From there you’ll be asked to choose one of the three pickup locations. Do that and you can order and pay for your rain barrel with a credit card.
You may buy as many rain barrels as you’d like, but the Metropolitan rebate and County discount are limited to two per household.
Finally, remember that your rain barrel will not be delivered. You can pick it up at any of the three pickup locations; remember to print out and bring your receipt.
Apply for your rebate(s)
$35 rebates from the Metropolitan Water District are available within 90 days of ordering/buying your rain barrel, so as soon as you order your rain barrel go to Metropolitan’s SoCalWaterSmart rain barrel rebates webpage. Rebates are available on a first-come, first-served basis. You can check out the Metropolitan Water District rebates’ frequently asked questions for help.
Pick up your rain barrel!
When you buy your barrel(s), Rainwater Solutions will email you a confirmation of your purchase. Remember to bring your confirmation email with you when you go to your chosen location to pick up your barrel. And remember to leave room in your car! Solana Center officials say that barrels fit easily in any four-door sedan or SUV and even into some two-door cars.
For more information, go to the Solana Center’s webpage.

291,County Moves Forward to Create New Climate Action Plan,"The County of San Diego moved forward Wednesday to start building a new Climate Action Plan but continue to follow 26 measures that cut 130,075 metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2019, nearly meeting all the County’s 2020 goals.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-moves-forward-to-create-new-climate-action-plan/,2020-09-30T18:41:53-07:00,"
The County of San Diego moved forward Wednesday to start building a new Climate Action Plan but continue to follow 26 measures that cut 130,075 metric tons of greenhouse gases in 2019, nearly meeting all the County’s 2020 goals.
The County’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to rescind the 2018 Climate Action Plan, after deciding in June not to further appeal a court ruling. That ruling and legal challenge, however, took no issue with the 26 measures the plan used to cut 130,075 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2019 according to the 2019 progress report released last week. Metric tons of carbon dioxide are a standard way to measure greenhouse gas emissions.
The 26 measures to cut greenhouse gases included, among other actions, the installation of solar photovoltaic panels on existing homes to generate electricity; increasing renewable energy overall; diverting more trash away from landfills where it can decompose and create methane; conserving agricultural and open space; and improving access to sustainable transportation such as electric vehicles. The measures were created to meet state greenhouse gas reduction targets in the County’s unincorporated communities in 2020 and 2030.
Last week’s progress report, which measured progress in 2019, stated that the County had reached 98% of the 2020 targets.
Some of the specific accomplishments it reported:

The County’s Planning & Development Services department (PDS) has waived fees for and issued solar rooftop permits for 48,547 homes since the baseline year of 2014, 93% of the 2020 target of 52,273 homes. PDS processed 6,598 residential solar permits online in 2019.
The County generated 6.2% of the energy it used at County-owned facilities in 2019 through solar power, 62% of its 2020 goal of reaching 10%.
The County has helped install 7,795 discounted rain barrels, including 427 in 2019, to cut residential water consumption, working with the nonprofit Solana Center. Conserving water cuts greenhouse gas emissions by reducing the amount of energy it takes to pump and treat water.
Through 2019, the County has planted 17,591 trees, including 3,661 in 2019, exceeding its 2020 goal of 14,000 trees.
The County reduced its energy use intensity — the amount of energy used in a building per square foot — by 23% in 2019, more than doubling the 10% 2020 target. The County also cut the fuel emissions from the County’s fleet of vehicles by 13%, also exceeding the 2020 10% goal.
Through 2019, the County has acquired 4,897 acres of conservation land, including 1,269 acres in 2019, exceeding the 2020 target of 2,622 acres.

Other notable County actions included:

The County Board of Supervisors approved an Electrical Vehicle Roadmap in October 2019 to encourage the use of electrical vehicles, a project that was honored with a 2020 Achievement Award by the National Association of Counties. The Roadmap identified six ways to invest in EV technology, including installing publicly available EV charging stations at County facilities; building out the EV charging infrastructure in the unincorporated County; and replacing more than 500 gas-powered County vehicles with electric vehicles by 2027.
In 2019, the County became the first jurisdiction in the region to offer residential solar energy battery-storage permits online. Installing a solar battery as part of a home solar energy system maximizes the household’s ability to use electricity generated by solar systems, often provides utility savings, and offers a back-up source of electricity during a power outage.

With the rescission of the 2018 CAP and EIR by the Board of Supervisors, the County will assess which aspects of its 2018 CAP and Environmental Impact Report (EIR) need to be redrafted and work in partnership with residents, business, and environmental groups to craft a new one.
That process is expected to take up to two years. As the court did not find fault with the 26 measures in the 2018 CAP, the County will also continue implementing sustainability measures to effectively reduce greenhouse gases as part of its ongoing commitment to the environment.

292,How to Fight the Two: COVID-19 and Influenza,"The novel coronavirus and influenza may be different viruses, but they can be fought in many of the same ways.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/how-to-fight-the-two-covid-19-and-influenza/,2020-10-01T10:50:38-07:00,"
The novel coronavirus and influenza may be different viruses, but they can be fought in many of the same ways.
The primary difference is there is a vaccine available now to protect you against the flu, while we wait for one to arrive for COVID-19.
Today, with influenza season on its way, County health officials are encouraging San Diegans to get vaccinated to prevent getting the flu.
“Influenza and COVID-19 are both respiratory illnesses. You must do all you can to prevent getting both at the same time,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Get a flu shot now and continue taking the recommended precautions that work at preventing both viruses.”
Where to Get a Flu Shot
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit www.sdiz.org or call 211 San Diego.
“The influenza vaccine is safe and effective,” Wooten said. “Get vaccinated now so that you can get protected when influenza begins to spread.”
A County employee gets a flu shot.
Tips to Prevent the Flu and COVID-19
The novel coronavirus and influenza are both spread from person to person, especially indoors and in crowded places.
Here are some tips to help you prevent COVID-19 and the flu:

Wash your hands properly and regularly or use a hand sanitizer.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw it away and wash your hands.
If you’re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.
Use a face covering when in public and close to others. They prevent spreading germs and viruses.
Maintain physical distance from others.
Avoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.

Last season, a total of 20,711 lab-confirmed flu cases were reported in the region and 108 San Diegans died from complications from influenza.
Through Sept. 30, a total of 47,180 COVId-19 cases have been reported in San Diego County, including 783 deaths.
For more information about influenza and COVID-19 is available at www.sdiz.org and www.coronavirus-sd.com, respectively.

298,Celebrating Halloween Safely Amid Coronavirus Pandemic,"Halloween is just around the corner, but like so many other special occasions and events, the 2020 edition of the spookiest day of the year will have to look a little different due to the coronavirus pandemic.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/celebrating-halloween-safely-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/,2020-10-05T11:10:11-07:00,"
Halloween is just around the corner, but like so many other special occasions and events, the 2020 edition of the spookiest day of the year will have to look a little different due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Many traditional Halloween activities pose a high risk for contracting or spreading COVID-19 because they typically bring together large groups of people that do not live in the same household.
“While Halloween activities must change, we still want people to be able to dress up and have fun for the holiday,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Maybe plan a virtual or drive-by costume party that lets you celebrate while keeping up the fight against the spread of the virus.”
Door-to-door trick-or-treating is one of the most popular Halloween activities, but it, along with trunk-or-treating, or leaving bowls of candy for others to grab, is not advisable: too hard to maintain proper social distancing. Instead, consider “one-way trick-or-treating,” where individually wrapped goodie bags are lined up outdoors, allowing families to grab them while practicing social distancing.
Gatherings of any size are not permissible under current public health orders so you should avoid in-person costume parties. Instead, get your friends and family together for a virtual costume party and vote for the best costumes from the comfort of your own couch.
Haunted houses are also not recommended because they often put crowds into tight, poorly ventilated areas. Instead, the County Health & Human Services Agency recommends dressing up your own home or yard with Halloween-themed decorations and taking a stroll or drive around your neighborhood to enjoy the spooky decor.
Other safe ways to celebrate Halloween and the fall season include:

Attending a drive-through Halloween event or car parade.
Watching a spooky movie with your household members, either at home or at a drive-in theater.
Carving pumpkins with members of your own household.
Making fall recipes and crafts as a family.

However you celebrate, please follow the established safety measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This includes wearing a face covering, maintaining physical distance, washing your hands, and staying home when you feel ill.

302,Register for Great ShakeOut Earthquake Drill,"The pandemic has many of us working or studying from home, so an earthquake preparedness drill could look very different this year.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/register-for-great-shakeout-earthquake-drill/,2020-10-08T13:55:09-07:00,"
The pandemic has many of us working or studying from home, so an earthquake preparedness drill could look very different this year.
If you have a plan, disaster supplies and you practice an earthquake drill with your family, your chances of surviving will greatly improve. Register to participate in the Great ShakeOut earthquake drill on October 15 at 10:15 a.m. It takes as little as 90 seconds and can be customized to fit your schedule. You can practice the drill before 10/15 or in the days after at any time, just so long as you take the time to learn and practice what to do during major shaking.
More than 5.2 million people in California and more than 17.5 million people worldwide will drop, cover and hold on under a desk or table to practice their earthquake response. So far, nearly 330,000 San Diego County residents have registered for this year’s drill.
ShakeOut earthquake drills are not just for those working from home or distance learning. Businesses and organizations are encouraged to practice with their employees and willing customers while following COVID-19 safety precautions. For example, some businesses may choose to videoconference a drill or stagger the number of people participating to maintain social distancing.
Earthquake preparedness is important because in a significant earthquake, people are more likely to be injured from falling debris than the shaking itself.
Prepare for where you are: If indoors, the safest thing to do is to Drop to the ground in a safe area and seek protection under a sturdy table or desk, if one is available. Once under the table, tuck your legs into your chest. Cover your head with one arm, and use your other arm to Hold on to the furniture leg in case the shaking causes the furniture to move.
If you are in a room without a table or desk, find an interior wall away from windows or mirrors and that is not under light fixtures or near heavy furniture that could topple over. Slide down with your back to the wall, tuck your legs into your chest and cover your head with both arms.
During strong shaking, stay in place. Moving can lead to falls or injuries from falling debris. Large items can topple over onto you such as tall bookcases, heavy items on shelves, or glass. After strong earthquakes, expect aftershocks. You’re safest if you stay put for several minutes to make sure the strongest shaking has passed.
If outdoors, try to move to an open area where nothing can fall on you. Then sit, pull your legs into your chest and protect your head using your hands. Outdoor hazards include tree branches, stone masonry on buildings and overhead electrical lines.
For more specific information for other scenarios, visit the ShakeOut website.
Learn what to do before an earthquake and try to prevent hazards. Secure furniture, large electronics and wall hangings around your home or workplace. You can also learn what to do afterward, including checking for a ruptured gas line, knowing how to turn it off if it has and knowing how to reunite with family if you are separated.
Drill tips and information resources are available on the ShakeOut website. Free personal disaster plan templates are also available on ReadySanDiego.org in multiple languages. The templates include a list of important items to assemble in your disaster emergency kit.
More local preparedness tips include: Downloading a free SDEmergency app for information and registering your cell phone or VoIP number or email with AlertSanDiego, the county’s emergency mass notification system.
On ShakeOut Day, 10/15, the County’s Office of Emergency Services is also asking residents to post a photo or video of themselves or others on Twitter or Facebook doing Drop, Cover and Hold On drills or showing other emergency preparation. For more details, visit the ReadySanDiego ShakeOut social media challenge page.

311,"If COVID-19 Symptoms Arise, Don’t Wait to Get Tested",A recent analysis of San Diego County data revealed that San Diegans are waiting an average of 3.5 days after symptoms develop before they get a COVID-19 test.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/if-covid-19-symptoms-arise-dont-wait-to-get-tested/,2020-10-14T17:43:59-07:00,"
A recent analysis of San Diego County data revealed that San Diegans are waiting an average of 3.5 days after symptoms develop before they get a COVID-19 test.
The delay could result in further COVID-19 exposures, especially if people do not isolate themselves from others.
“People should get tested immediately after they start feeling sick,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “They should also isolate themselves to avoid exposing those around them.”
Because there is substantial spread of COVID-19 in the community, people who start feeling sick should assume it’s because of the novel coronavirus, get tested right away and isolate themselves from other people, including their families.
People with COVID-19 can have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or severe illness. Common symptoms include:

Fever or chills
Cough
Difficulty breathing
Fatigue
New loss of taste or smell
Body aches
Runny nose
Congestion
Headache
Sore throat

Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.
“People experiencing symptoms should be in isolation while they wait for their test results, and, if they are positive, they should continue to be away from others,” Wooten said. “If you have severe symptoms, like difficulty breathing, contact your doctor immediately.”
County public health nurse administers a COVID-19 test.
People who test positive should remain in isolation until 10 days after onset of symptoms and no fever for at least 24 hours without use of fever-reducing medications and improvement of other symptoms.
Anyone who is sick or infected should separate themselves from others by staying in a specific “sick room” or area and using a separate bathroom (if available). Close contacts of people who test positive for COVID-19 should quarantine themselves for 14 days and monitor for symptoms.
For people who are not able to isolate or quarantine themselves at home, the County has public health rooms for the public.
The County operates about 40 COVID-19 testing sites and most do not require an appointment. To find a no-appointment site near you, or to make an appointment, visit www.211sandiego.org or call 2-1-1. You can view the testing sites by day here.
State Metrics:

The state issued its weekly assessment of risk levels yesterday, and San Diego County remains in Tier 2, also referred to as the Red Tier.

312,You Don’t Need to Wait Until Election Day – Vote Early!,The Registrar’s office reminds you that you can make voting decisions and complete your mail ballot in the comfort and safety of your home.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/you-dont-need-to-wait-until-election-day-vote-early/,2020-10-15T08:14:24-07:00,"
The Registrar’s office reminds you that you can make voting decisions and complete your mail ballot in the comfort and safety of your home. Remember to sign and date your envelope, seal your completed ballot inside and return it to a trusted source. You can return it by mail, no postage needed, or at one of 126 mail ballot drop-off locations around the county.
“If you know how you want to vote, mark your ballot and return it to a trusted source right away,” said Registrar Michael Vu. “The sooner we get the ballot back, the sooner we can start processing it. Your ballot can be in the first release of Election Night results if you act early.”
However, if you need to vote in person that option is available too. You can do so now:

At the Registrar’s office, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday
At your assigned polling place or the Registrar’s office 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 31 through Monday, Nov. 2.

All will again be open on Election Day, Nov. 3, when the voting hours change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
There will be fewer locations than in prior elections, so your polling place has most likely changed. Larger polling sites, called “Super Polls,” will accommodate social distancing as required by the COVID-19 guidelines. In addition, Super Polls will be open four days instead of one.
If you plan to vote in person, be prepared. Wear your face mask, go to your assigned polling place and maintain social distance.
The Registrar’s office encourages older adults and people with underlying medical conditions to avoid long lines and crowded polling places by voting early.

313,Free Flu Shots Available at County Clinics,The County of San Diego is ramping up its flu vaccination efforts to lower the risk of San Diegans getting influenza and the novel coronavirus at the same time and prevent the local healthcare system from being overwhelmed.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/free-flu-shots-available-at-county-clinics/,2020-10-15T09:44:16-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is ramping up its flu vaccination efforts to lower the risk of San Diegans getting influenza and the novel coronavirus at the same time and prevent the local healthcare system from being overwhelmed.
Every year, the County sponsors free vaccination clinics throughout the region where you can get a flu shot. Six clinics will take place in October and early November with vaccine available for adults and children ages six months and up.
“The clinics are free and primarily for people with no medical insurance,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We want everyone to be protected against the flu and its possible complications.”
The upcoming clinics will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at:
Oct. 22
North Central Public Health Center – 5055 Ruffin Rd., San Diego, CA 92123
Oct 24
South Public Health Center – 690 Oxford St., Chula Vista, CA 91911
Oct. 27
North Coastal Public Health Center – 3609 Ocean Ranch Blvd, Oceanside, CA 92056
Oct, 28
Central Public Health Center VIP Trailer – 3177A Oceanview Blvd., San Diego, CA 92113

East Public Health Center – 367 N. Magnolia Ave., El Cajon, CA 92020
Nov. 3
North Inland Public Health Center – 640 W. Mission Ave #2, Escondido, CA 92025
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone six months of age and older get flu shot every year.
The flu vaccine is safe and effective. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop, so it’s best to get your vaccine now before influenza starts to spread in the community.
Vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if your symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is covered by medical insurance and is also available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies.
People with no healthcare coverage can get vaccinated at a Community Health Center or County public health center throughout the flu season. For a list of locations, visit sdiz.org or call 2-1-1.

316,County in Danger of Falling into Purple Tier,"The local COVID-19 adjusted case rate has steadily increased and has reached 7.0 cases per every 100,000 residents, placing the County in danger of being moved into the state’s more restrictive Purple Tier or Tier 1.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-in-danger-of-falling-into-purple-tier/,2020-10-16T17:58:11-07:00,"
The local COVID-19 adjusted case rate has steadily increased and has reached 7.0 cases per every 100,000 residents, placing the County in danger of being moved into the state’s more restrictive Purple Tier or Tier 1.
Should the case rate reach 7.1 or higher for two consecutive weeks, indoor activities will not be allowed at restaurants, movie theaters, gyms and a number of other locations.
County health officials are asking San Diegans to be vigilant and continue following the local health guidance to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
“San Diegans must take action and do it now. We need everyone’s support so that we can prevent the region from moving into the most restrictive level,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should stay home as much as possible, telework if they can and avoid gatherings to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
The County’s COVID-19 unadjusted case rate for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10 increased from 7.2 to 7.8.  The adjusted metric also rose from 6.8 to 7.0 cases per 100,000 people during the same time.
Should the region post Purple Tier numbers for two weeks in a row, the County would be forced to follow the more restrictive state guidance.
“We must bring our numbers down and the only way to do that is to limit our contact with people outside our households,” Wooten said. “San Diegans who need to be out in public should wear a mask and maintain their distance from people outside their household. Avoid large crowds or gatherings to prevent getting or passing the virus.”
Given the data reported for the week of Oct. 4 through Oct. 10, the County is expected to still be in the Red Tier when the state announces the region new standing Oct. 20.
State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.8 per 100,000 residents. Limit for Tier 2 is 7.0.
The testing positivity percentage is 3.0%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.
The state’s health equity metric looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions.

323,County Probation Awarded Grant to Supervise DUI Offenders,"The San Diego County Probation Department received a $371,485 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to supervise high-risk, repeat DUI offenders.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-probation-awarded-grant-to-supervise-dui-offenders/,2020-10-23T10:20:59-07:00,"
The San Diego County Probation Department received a $371,485 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to supervise high-risk, repeat DUI offenders.
DUI Probation Officers supervise individuals in San Diego County seven days a week during non-traditional hours, including weekends and holidays. In addition to enforcing sobriety, officers work with community partners to provide appropriate resources for each person and to assist them with their overall compliance with the conditions of their grant of probation. The support provided by the Probation Department and collaboration with local agencies is essential for clients’ successful completion of probation without reoffending.
“The grant partially funds our work to hold reoffenders accountable through supervision and enforcement,” said Ruben Leyva, Assistant Chief Probation Officer. “Our officers not only ensure compliance for court-ordered conditions but they also offer guidance to the offenders to help them on their path to rehabilitation and sobriety so we can make highways and roads safer.”
The one-year grant period started Oct. 1 this year. OTS has awarded San Diego County Probation Department DUI Grant funding for 14 years. Grant funding will be used to make sure offenders are following the court-ordered terms of their probation, including home, work and office visits, random alcohol testing, and warrant service operations.
In addition, funding will also be used to develop “hot sheets” that identify repeat DUI offenders, work with court officials to establish probation orders for DUI offenders on probation and provide Standard Field Sobriety Test training to officers.
This grant is aimed at reducing the number of persons killed and injured in alcohol-related collisions, as well as lower DUI recidivism rates.
“Prevention is the best tool to address the significant traffic safety issue of DUI,” OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. “The goal of Probation programs is to help people convicted of DUI not put themselves in a position to make the same mistake again.”
Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
As a member of the San Diego County Law Enforcement Task Force against Youth Access to Alcohol, the DUI Unit supports several alcohol enforcement activities in the community and works with local law enforcement and stakeholders to improve road safety and educate the public on the dangers of impaired driving.

324,Valley Fire Survivors May Apply for Federal Aid to Help With Losses,"Homeowners or renters affected by the Valley Fire in September can now apply for a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant through Dec. 15. The grants are designed to help with serious disaster-related expenses not covered by insurance such as rent, home repair or replacement, medical or dental costs, transportation or other personal property losses.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/valley-fire-victims-may-apply-for-federal-aid-to-help-with-losses/,2020-10-23T15:04:20-07:00,"
Homeowners or renters affected by the Valley Fire in September can now apply for a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant through Dec. 15. The grants are designed to help with serious disaster-related expenses not covered by insurance such as rent, home repair or replacement, medical or dental costs, transportation or other personal property losses.
Residents or businesses can also apply for a low-interest loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration.
Due to the pandemic, FEMA has put its assistance process online and has a telephone helpline. For those requiring in-person assistance, FEMA will have staff present as the Rancho San Diego Library on Thursday, Oct. 29 from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and on Saturday, Oct. 31 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The library is located at 11555 Via Rancho San Diego in El Cajon.
To begin the grant application process, residents must first register with FEMA either by visiting DisasterAssistance.gov, downloading the FEMA app on your smartphone or tablet or calling the FEMA Helpline at 1-800-621-3362 (TTY 800-462-7595) between 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. everyday. The helpline has specialists who speak various languages.
Grant applicants will be asked to give the need for funding and the following information:

Social Security number
Address of the damaged primary residence
Description of the damage
Information about insurance coverage
A current contact telephone number
An address where they can receive mail
Bank account and routing numbers for direct deposit of funds

FEMA grants do not have to be repaid. FEMA assistance is nontaxable and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid or other federal benefits.
Registering for federal aid through FEMA is required, even if homeowners, renters or business owners have registered for assistance with other disaster-relief organizations such as the American Red Cross. Residents should register even if they have insurance since FEMA may be able to assist with underinsured losses after the claims are settled.
The U.S. Small Business Administration is also offering low-interest disaster loans and has established a virtual Disaster Loan Outreach Center staffed from 5 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week. A customer service representative can answer questions about the loan program, explain the application process and help residents and business owners complete their electronic loan application.  To contact the SBA representatives, either email them at FOCWAssistance@sba.gov or call 1-800-659-2955 (TTY 1-800877-8339).
For more information about the disaster loan program, potential applicants may also email disastercustomerservice@sba.gov or visit SBA.gov/disaster.
More Valley Fire disaster assistance information is available at sdcountyrecovery.com or by emailing ValleyFireRecovery@sdcounty.ca.gov.

330,"Keep It Up San Diego – Vote Safer, Vote Early","With just over a week left to vote, the Registrar’s office reports more than 725,000 San Diego County voters have already cast their ballots in the Nov. 3 Presidential General Election.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/keep-it-up-san-diego-vote-safer-vote-early/,2020-10-26T16:29:10-07:00,"
With just over a week left to vote, the Registrar’s office reports more than 725,000 San Diego County voters have already cast their ballots in the Nov. 3 Presidential General Election. That’s 435,000 more than those returned as of this date for the November 2016 presidential election. And it’s more than a third of all 1.95 million mail ballots sent to voters this year.
As part of its COVID-19 Vote Safer San Diego campaign, the Registrar urges you to vote safer and vote early. Make voting decisions and complete your ballot from the safety of your home. Sign and date your return envelope, seal your completed ballot inside and return it to a trusted source.
Ballots received by the Registrar’s office throughout this week should be processed in time for the first release of Election Night results that are posted shortly after 8 p.m. The sooner you return your mail ballot, the sooner Registrar’s staff can process it into the count.
If you want to vote in-person that option is available, too. The Registrar urges you to avoid crowds and take advantage of early voting. You can do so:

Now at the Registrar’s office, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
At your assigned polling place, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., starting Saturday, Oct. 31 through Monday, Nov. 2.

All will again be open on Election Day, Nov. 3, when the voting hours change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Registrar’s office encourages older adults and people with underlying medical conditions to avoid long lines and crowded polling places by voting early.
To vote in person, be prepared. Wear your face mask, go to your assigned polling place and plan to maintain social distance. Your polling place has most likely changed so check the back of your sample ballot and voter information pamphlet for your assigned poll first before you head out to vote or you can look it up at sdvote.com.

331,County COVID-19 Case Rate Improves as Region Remains in Red Tier,"Two of the three metrics used by the state to determine tier placement for COVID-19 risk declined in the San Diego region, placing the County further from falling into the Purple Tier, or Tier 1, the most restrictive on activities.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-covid-19-case-rate-improves-as-region-remains-in-red-tier/,2020-10-27T16:51:24-07:00,"
Two of the three metrics used by the state to determine tier placement for COVID-19 risk declined in the San Diego region, placing the County further from falling into the Purple Tier, or Tier 1, the most restrictive on activities.
At an update to the County Board of Supervisors, local health officials announced the region’s COVID-19 adjusted case rate decreased from 7.0 to 6.5 cases per every 100,000 residents, keeping the region in the Red Tier or Tier 2.
The state’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, decreased from 5.5 to 5.1%. San Diego’s figure moved from the Red Tier into the Orange Tier, but the metric does not on its own allow counties to advance to a less restrictive tier.
The testing positivity percentage went up slightly from 3.3 to 3.5%, keeping this metric in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.
While two of the three metrics qualify the County for the Orange Tier or Tier 3, the state assigns counties to the most restrictive tier. Therefore, San Diego County will stay in the Red Tier or Tier 2.
County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to follow the local health guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19.
“Washing your hands, keeping six feet apart from others, wearing a face covering, avoiding crowds and large gatherings and staying home if you’re sick are critically important in determining the future local course of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
“Until a vaccine is available to achieve herd immunity, these strategies directly impact both the testing positivity and the case rates and are evidence-based practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Wooten added.
The California Department of Public Health will continue to assess counties on a weekly basis, with the next report scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 3.
County Waives Multiple Fees
At the meeting, the Board voted to extend the deferral deadline of annual health permit fees, plan check fees and late fees for restaurants and food facilities to aid businesses and the local economy affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The action also includes an extension of permit and inspection fee waivers and deferrals, lease payment deferrals, ordinance amendments, new programs, extended services and continue business assistance programs as directed by the Board on May 5, 2020.
The deferral and waiver period for these fees had expired or will expire at the end of the month or end of December. The deferral, proposed by Board Vice Chairman Jim Desmond and Supervisor Kristin Gaspar, has been extended until March 31, 2021.
The action was needed to help local businesses contend with the loss of revenue associated with the COVID-19 health emergency.
Most County-managed testing sites do not require an appointment.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Two new community outbreaks were confirmed on Oct. 26: one in a daycare setting and the other in a business.
In the past seven days (Oct. 20 through Oct. 26), 24 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.

Testing:

10,456 tests were reported to the County on Oct. 26, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 3%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 2.7%. Target is less than 8.0%.

In a first for a County of San Diego election, the polls for the Nov. 3 Presidential General Election will open for four days, starting this weekend.

Due to the pandemic and a predicted high voter turnout, the Registrar’s office is urging you to avoid long lines and crowded polling places by voting before Election Day itself.
There are fewer polling places than in past elections, and the location of your poll has most likely changed so check the back of your sample ballot and voter information pamphlet for your assigned poll before you head out to vote this weekend.
Your assigned poll was also included on the Registrar’s postcard reminder sent to voters last week or you can look it up at sdvote.com.
The hours at the polls and the Registrar of Voters office will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Election Day, Nov. 3. You should prepare for long lines.
To vote in person, be prepared.

Go to your assigned polling place.
Be vote ready. Mark your selections on your sample ballot in advance so when you go inside the voting booth, you can quickly fill in the official ballot.
Wear your face mask and maintain social distance. If you forget your mask, poll workers will give you one. Voters who are unable or unwilling to wear a facial covering or mask will be assisted outside at a social distance and will be able to vote outside.
Follow all instructions provided by poll workers.

The Registrar of Voters is adhering to the County’s public health orders and has put in place protocols to ensure the health and safety of election workers, voters and observers at the Registrar’s office, polling places and mail ballot drop-off locations. This includes:

Hand sanitizer when entering and exiting the facility
Masks and gloves
Plexiglass barriers and floor markers to ensure social distancing
A defined path of travel throughout the facility
Regular cleaning/disinfecting of frequently touched objects and surfaces
Poll workers wearing gloves, masks and in some cases, face shields
Poll workers undergoing a temperature screening before their shift

Remember campaigning or electioneering within 100 feet of a polling place or mail ballot drop-off location is not allowed. This includes the visible display or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate or measure on the ballot.
Voters can still save themselves the trip and mark their ballot from home. Be sure to sign and date the return envelope, seal your completed ballot inside and return it to a mail ballot drop-off location or your assigned polling place.
You can confirm your ballot was received by the Registrar’s office online at sdvote.com.

333,San Diegans Reminded to Celebrate Halloween Safely During COVID-19,"County health officials are reminding the public that traditional Halloween celebrations are not advised, and large gatherings are not allowed, under the state or local health guidance.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-reminded-to-celebrate-halloween-safely-during-covid-19/,2020-10-28T17:27:35-07:00,"
County health officials are reminding the public that traditional Halloween celebrations are not advised, and large gatherings are not allowed, under the state or local health guidance.
Halloween celebrations – such as parties and in-person, door-to-door trick-or-treating – pose a high risk of spreading COVID-19 and are strongly discouraged.
“These activities involve face-to-face interactions with people from different households,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If a COVID-19 infection is detected among a participant, it will be very difficult to find and notify those who may have been exposed.”
Wooten recommends the following safe Halloween activities to make sure children have a fun and safe celebration:

Online parties/contests such as costume or pumpkin carving
Drive-through events and car parades
Dressing up homes and yards with Halloween-themed decorations

335,County Begins Improvements to Lakeside’s Lindo Lake County Park,"The County has broken ground on $11.2 million of work to rejuvenate and improve Lakeside’s popular Lindo Lake County Park, including removing more than 200,000 tons of built-up sediment from the lake's east basin.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-begins-improvements-to-lakesides-lindo-lake-county-park/,2020-10-30T10:02:04-07:00,"
The County has broken ground on $11.2 million of work to rejuvenate and improve Lakeside’s popular Lindo Lake County Park.
Improvements at the 55-acre park will include building a new fishing pier and birdwatching stations, planting hundreds of native trees and improving water quality in the lake’s east basin by removing more than 200,000 tons of sediment — enough to cover nearly five football fields 12 feet high — that has built up over decades.
County Supervisor Dianne Jacob and County Parks officials kicked off the start of construction last week with a socially distanced groundbreaking. Jacob, who is retiring in January after serving 27 years, has long championed efforts to rejuvenate the park.
“Lindo Lake is a centerpiece for the Lakeside community,” Jacob said. “And this project has been worked on for many, many years, probably over 20 years … so this is a big, big project for Lakeside.”
The $11.2 Million in improvements are expected to be completed in spring of 2022 and are the first of what are expected to be two phases of improvements for Lindo Lake County Park.
In addition to the new fishing pier and two birdwatching stations, the first phase will add new walking paths and three new lake-viewing areas with seating, all accessible to people with disabilities.
The project will also restore roughly 12 acres of native terrestrial habitat surrounding the park’s east basin, in part by planting more than 260 trees.
However, the largest piece of the park’s restoration will be the work to rejuvenate the east basin of Lindo Lake itself. That will include removing hundreds of tons of sediment to deepen it, adding more water and installing aeration systems to keep the water oxygenated and healthy, and adding nearly 100 fish habitat and spawning systems to the basin’s bottom.
Lindo Lake is the only natural lake in San Diego County, and Lakeside was built around it in the 1800s. However, it was cut off from its natural source of replenishment in 1961 when a dam was built upstream on Quail Creek to create Lake Jennings. Over time, that has shrunk Lindo Lake in size, split it into two basins, west and east, and deteriorated their water quality forcing it to rely upon urban and stormwater runoff from surrounding hillsides and groundwater.
A second phase of improvements for the park is anticipated to start in the summer of 2022, pending approval of the County Parks department’s funding request in the next County budget.

341,Election Results – When to Expect Them,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away. But counting ballots takes time, and the November 3 Presidential General Election is more complicated than past elections due to the many changes related to the pandemic. Here are some reasons why:",https://www.countynewscenter.com/election-results-when-to-expect-them-6/,2020-11-03T12:07:15-08:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away. But counting ballots takes time, and the November 3 Presidential General Election is more complicated than past elections due to the many changes related to the pandemic. Here are some reasons why:

Record high number of 1.95 million registered voters.
More mail ballots than ever before because every active registered voter received a ballot in the mail.
Mail ballots can be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and received up to Nov. 20.
Polling places opened for a four-day period, Oct. 31 – Nov. 3.

So what can you expect on election night?
The first set of results comes in shortly after 8 p.m. Unlike past elections, where the first election night results encompass only mail ballots, the first report for the upcoming election will also contain polling place precinct ballots that returned to the Registrar’s office from Oct. 31 through Nov. 2.
The Election Day precinct ballots come in after the polls close at 8 p.m. and must be driven in from 235 polling places across the county.
Upon arrival, the ballots are scanned and results will be periodically updated throughout the night until most of the precinct ballots have been counted.
It may be midnight, however, before all polling place ballots arrive at the Registrar’s. The final unofficial election night results may not come in until after 3 a.m. and will only cover the ballots that can be counted immediately. You can follow the Registrar’s office on Twitter for updates.
The record-breaking number of mail ballots that have been returned early shows how the pandemic has possibly changed voter behavior. The Registrar anticipates that only 20 to 30% will remain and be reported after the Election Night count.
Some races may be considered easy to predict, but tight races will be up in the air.
Here’s what remains to be counted.
Mail ballots. The Registrar’s office mailed over 1.95 million ballots for this election and anticipates between 250,000 to 300,000 mail ballots could be dropped off at the polls or picked up at the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Plus, mail ballots sent right before or on Election Day have 17 days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots. People who missed the Oct. 19 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day.
More than 250,000 county residents who are not registered but otherwise eligible can take advantage of this, but for every provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter was eligible to vote – and eligible to vote on the races they marked on the ballot.
“Between mail ballots and provisional ballots, a close race always comes to the very end,” said Vu. “We must do our due diligence to make sure everything is right.”
Some races may not be decided for several weeks.
However, the results must be certified 30 days after Election Day, on Dec. 3, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.

343,COVID-19 Case Rate Lands County in First Week of Purple Tier,"After weeks of being on the edge of entering the Purple Tier, the County’s adjusted case rate rose above 7.0 cases per 100,000, landing the region for one week in the state’s most restrictive COVID-19 level.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-case-rate-lands-county-in-first-week-of-purple-tier/,2020-11-04T16:32:49-08:00,"
After weeks of being on the edge of entering the Purple Tier, the County’s adjusted case rate rose above 7.0 cases per 100,000, landing the region for one week in the state’s most restrictive COVID-19 level.
While the adjusted case rate increased from 6.5 to 7.4 in the past week, the County remains for now in the Red Tier, or Tier 2, of activity restrictions. Should the rate continue to be above 7.0 cases per 100,000 residents for a second week in a row, restaurants, gyms, churches, theaters and other locations will need to end indoor operations under state guidance.
“The region now is in greater danger of moving into the most restrictive tier, which would mean that indoor activities would cease,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
The state’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, increased slightly from 5.1% to 5.3% which is in the Red Tier. This metric does not on its own allow counties to advance a tier or move to one more restrictive level.
The testing positivity percentage dropped from 3.5% to 3.2%, keeping this metric in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.
Wooten urged San Diegans to follow the local health guidance to slow the spread of COVID-19. That includes:

Washing your hands
Keeping six feet apart from others
Wearing a face covering
Avoiding crowds and large gatherings
Staying home if you’re sick

“San Diegans need to be more dedicated to taking preventing measures to get the region out of the Purple Tier should the County fall into it,” Wooten said. “We know these measures work to prevent COVID-19 and to slow the pandemic.”
The California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 10.

344,Flu Activity Extremely Low This Season Due to COVID-19 Measures,A total of 18 influenza cases have been reported in the county this season compared to 400 at the same time last year. County health officials believe this is the result of the preventive measures San Diegans are taking to fight the spread of COVID-19.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-activity-extremely-low-this-season-due-to-covid-19-measures/,2020-11-05T09:51:48-08:00,"
A total of 18 influenza cases have been reported in the county this season compared to 400 at the same time last year.
County health officials believe this is the result of the preventive measures San Diegans are taking to fight the spread of COVID-19.
“When the stay-at-home order was issued last season, flu cases dropped dramatically. We’re seeing the same trend this season, and we hope it continues,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It’s clear that wearing a face covering, maintaining social distance, avoiding large crowds and taking other preventative measures are also helping to slow the spread of influenza.”
Also, no influenza deaths have been reported this season, which began July 1 and will through June 30, 2021. In comparison, three flu-related deaths had been reported at the same time last year. A total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza last season.
A greater number of San Diegans also are getting vaccinated this season compared to the same point last year. To date, nearly 818,660 people have gotten flu shots compared to 746,095 at the same time last year. A total of 1,234,474 people got a flu shot last season, the highest on record.
“San Diegans are stepping up to get vaccinated against influenza and that is also a good thing,” Wooten said. “A flu shot helps to lower the risk of San Diegans getting influenza and the novel coronavirus at the same time and prevent the local health care system from being overwhelmed.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
Where to Get a Flu Shot
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, sandiegocounty.gov/iz or call 2-1-1.
“The influenza vaccine is safe and effective,” Wooten said. “Get vaccinated now so that you can get protected when influenza begins to spread.”
Tips to Prevent the Flu and COVID-19
The novel coronavirus and influenza are both spread from person to person, especially indoors and in crowded places.
Here are some tips to help you prevent COVID-19 and the flu:

Wash your hands properly and regularly or use a hand sanitizer.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw it away and wash your hands.
If you’re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.
Use a face covering when in public and close to others. They prevent spreading germs and viruses.
Maintain physical distance from others.
Avoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.

345,"Fentanyl, Prescription Drug Deaths Increase in San Diego County","The number of unintentional fentanyl deaths increased by 64% from 2018 to 2019, while at the same time prescription drug deaths rose nearly 12%.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/fentanyl-prescription-drug-deaths-increase-in-san-diego-county/,2020-11-05T14:25:35-08:00,"
The number of unintentional fentanyl deaths increased by 64% from 2018 to 2019, while at the same time prescription drug deaths rose nearly 12%.
This is according to the 2020 San Diego County Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force  Report Card released today. The report card provides a variety of data to measure the prescription drug misuse problem in the region by looking at multiple factors and data points over the last five years in San Diego County.
In 2019, a total of 645 people died of an unintentional overdose caused by prescription and illicit drugs, as well as alcohol. Those include:

151 fentanyl deaths compared to the 92 reported the previous year. The number continued to increase in 2020. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid primarily coming from Mexico that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin.
275 deaths due to prescription drugs—opioids and non-opioids—up from 245 in 2018.
124 heroin deaths, up from the 105 reported the year before.

In addition to deaths, the report card tracks additional key indicators of opioid misuse in the region. It also shows the following (most recent years for which numbers are available vary by statistic):

6,162 visits to local emergency rooms in 2018, compared to 6,607 in 2017. Data for last year won’t be available until 2021.
Fewer 11th graders reported prescription drug use in 2019 than in 2015.
Nearly half of adults arrested reported misusing prescription drugs in 2019.

Treatment is Available
The County funds prevention and treatment services throughout the region. Preventing drug misuse and getting people into treatment is one of the goals of the County’s Live Well San Diego vision, which aims to improve the health and safety of residents in the region.
Treatment is available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240.
Eleven years ago, the County and its partners ramped up efforts to address the prescription drug misuse problem in the region. In 2008, the County Board of Supervisors established the Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force, which includes the County Sheriff’s Department, the District Attorney, the Health and Human Services Agency, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, and multiple other key partners, including local law enforcement, treatment and health and prevention organizations.

346,"County Reports 530 New Cases, Region on Brink of Purple Tier","The number of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to increase in San Diego County and health officials are urging San Diegans, especially those with any symptoms, to get tested for the virus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reports-530-new-cases-region-on-brink-of-purple-tier/,2020-11-05T16:04:33-08:00,"
The number of lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to increase in San Diego County and health officials are urging San Diegans, especially those with any symptoms, to get tested for the virus.
“The sooner a positive individual gets tested, the sooner we can start the contact tracing efforts, which helps slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
COVID-19 testing is now widely available across the county and those with insurance can get tested by their provider at no cost. Testing takes only a few minutes and results generally come back within 3 days.
Rise in Cases
After weeks of being on the brink of slipping into the most restrictive Purple Tier, the County’s case rate rose above 7.0 cases per 100,000 this week. While a single week of a high score does not move a county into a more restrictive tier, the region will be moved if numbers do not improve.
A move to the Purple Tier would close indoor operations at restaurants, gyms, churches, theaters and other locations.
“Cases are increasing in the region and it is vital that we take this virus seriously and recommit ourselves to the strategies that are proven to work,” Wooten said. “Wear a face covering when you go out in public, stay six feet away from others and avoid crowds and large gatherings.”
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Six new community outbreaks were confirmed on Nov. 4: three in business settings, two in retail settings, and one in a faith-based setting.
In the past seven days (Oct. 29 through Nov. 4), 23 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.

Testing:

15,905 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 4, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 3%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.1%. Target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,440.

347,First Cold Rains on the Way; Free Sandbags for Unincorporated Residents,San Diego County is expected to see its first real rains in months this weekend and the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE have free sandbags to help residents in unincorporated communities protect their homes and properties.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/first-cold-rains-on-the-way-free-sandbags-for-unincorporated-residents/,2020-11-05T17:04:23-08:00,"
San Diego County is expected to see its first widespread rains in months this weekend and the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE have free sandbags to help residents in unincorporated communities protect their homes and properties.
The National Weather Service is forecasting rain and winds around San Diego County this weekend, meaning this could be a good time to pick up some free sand and bags.
As they have in the past, the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are providing free sand and bags to residents in unincorporated areas at numerous fire stations around the county.
Rain can cause flooding and erosion, particularly in areas that aren’t covered by plants, landscaping, grass and trees.
Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.
Sand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.
People should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags. Some stations may have a limited supply.

348,Don’t Skip Routine Health Care Visits Amid COVID-19 Pandemic,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is urging San Diegans not to delay routine medical and dental care amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/dont-skip-routine-health-care-visits-amid-covid-19-pandemic/,2020-11-06T11:10:10-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is urging San Diegans not to delay routine medical and dental care amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Physicians and dentists across the county are reporting that fewer patients are scheduling annual medical and routine preventive dental visits. County health officials are concerned about this trend because delaying necessary care can cause more severe health issues in the future.
“Regular visits to your primary care physician and dentist are essential self-care activities that can prevent painful procedures and costly medical bills down the line,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Detecting and treating chronic conditions is especially important during this pandemic because people with underlying conditions are at a higher risk of poor outcomes of COVID-19.”
At the very beginning of the pandemic, health officials urged the public to seek care only for urgent and emergency procedures due to a desire to conserve personal protective equipment for medical providers in hospitals, and because of concerns about possible transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.
Since then, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and American Dental Association (ADA) have developed science-based recommendations for enhanced infection control procedures for medical and dental offices.
Enhanced Safety Procedures at Dental Offices
Local dentists have worked diligently to implement measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Dental offices have equipped staff with additional personal protective equipment and have boosted their disinfection procedures to keep patients safe during their visits.
“Dentists have long been leaders in the area of infection control and dental providers have continuously implemented the evolving guidance from government agencies and the ADA to keep their patients safe and healthy,” said Thomas Olinger, D.D.S., County Chief Dental Officer. “Going to the dentist is safe and we strongly urge San Diegans to resume routine dental appointments.”
County residents who would like to seek dental care but do not have a dentist, can call 2-1-1 San Diego for a referral or visit the 2-1-1 San Diego Health & Wellness website.

A new grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) will help the County Health & Human Services Agency teach parents and caregivers how to keep their children as safe as possible while riding in a vehicle.
The $225,000, one-year grant will pay for a car seat education program that encourages the proper installation and use of child safety seats.
The grant funds the following activities:

One-on-one appointments to inspect car seats
Child safety seat education classes for parents and caregivers
Child safety seats at no-cost to low-income families following education classes
Child Passenger Safety Technician training and certification courses
Work with community partners to promote child passenger safety education
Collaborate with law enforcement to increase occupant protection awareness

According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 46% of car seats are misused.
“Car seats save lives,” OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. “Keeping children safe in a vehicle is as important as ever, and funding for car seat programs plays a vital role in ensuring the proper use of child safety seats.”
This safety campaign aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

352,Paul Parker Returns to Lead County Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board,"A familiar face has returned to lead the County of San Diego’s Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board, CLERB, as the agency moves forward with expanded authority and increased law-enforcement oversight capabilities.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/paul-parker-returns-to-lead-county-citizens-law-enforcement-review-board/,2020-11-12T13:41:21-08:00,"
A familiar face has returned to lead the County of San Diego’s Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board, CLERB, as the agency moves forward with expanded authority and increased law-enforcement oversight capabilities.
Paul Parker returned late last week to take over as CLERB’s executive officer, chosen by CLERB’s board to succeed Julio Estrada, who announced last month he was retiring from the County after serving 28 years, the last year and 10 months as CLERB’s leader.
Parker was CLERB’s executive officer in 2017-18 before leaving to become chief deputy director of the Los Angeles County’s medical examiner/coroner’s office. But Parker said this week that he was excited to return, not just to come back to San Diego, but to be involved in a key moment of nationwide change to “improve law enforcement and community relations.”
“The challenges that CLERB faces now with expanded oversight approved by the Board (in June),” Parker said, “the increase in staff, the movement of CLERB to the County’s Finance and General Government Group, and with the national trend of improving law enforcement and community relations, all that together is why I jump at the challenge.”
CLERB Board Chairwoman Susan Youngflesh said the agency was eager to have Parker back, someone with extensive experience in the law enforcement and the investigatory field, who has already done the job and proven to have familiar relationships with both the Sheriff’s and Probation departments.
Parker was a police officer for 10 years before spending most of the last 20 years in the medical examiner/coroner field in San Diego; Phoenix, Arizona; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Los Angeles.
CLERB was created by San Diego County voters in 1990 to provide independent investigation and oversight of the County’s Sheriff’s and Probation departments. Part of its authority includes oversight of all County jails in the unincorporated areas and in the nine cities that use the County’s Sheriff’s Department to provide law enforcement.
In June, the County Board of Supervisors approved increasing CLERB’s independence and strengthening its oversight. The action came in response to protests here and across the country after the police killing in May of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
The Board’s action included:

Directing CLERB to increase community involvement in the appointment process for its 11-member, volunteer board of directors
Moving CLERB from the County’s Public Safety Group, which includes the Sheriff’s and Probation departments, to the Finance and General Government Group “to make sure CLERB is independent from the departments it is tasked with overseeing”
Expanding CLERB’s investigatory authority, funding and staffing

Before the Board action, CLERB already had the ability to subpoena witnesses and evidence in its investigations, but its investigatory power had limits. CLERB was authorized to investigate, without a complaint, all deaths arising out of or in connection to actions of peace officers or custodial officers employed by the Sheriff’s Department or Probation Department.
Beyond that, CLERB could only investigate instances when a member of the public signed an official complaint. If people were hesitant for any reason to sign complaints, the agency could not investigate, even if CLERB felt there was merit to those complaints.
The Board of Supervisors vote in June changes that. CLERB will have the authority to investigate, without public complaints, any incidents that involve County custodial, Sheriff’s or Probation officers and: the discharge of a firearm; use of force resulting in great bodily injury; and use of force in protests or other events protected by the First Amendment.
Parker said one of CLERB’s first goals will be to increase community outreach in San Diego County, to better acquaint the public with CLERB’s role and work, to be “more proactive” with the public it serves.
“I think this is the ideal time to be executive director of a civilian oversight entity in the United States,” Parker said. “And with my experience here in San Diego, already forming and having relationships, knowing the players involved at both the Sheriff’s and Probation departments … this is an exciting time. We have a lot of work to do.”

353,County Launches COVID-19 Case Rate Map as Cases Set Record,The County is launching a COVID-19 case rate map that shows how cities and communities are being impacted by the novel coronavirus.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-launches-covid-19-case-rate-map-as-cases-set-record/,2020-11-12T16:19:54-08:00,"
The County is launching a COVID-19 case rate map that shows how cities and communities are being impacted by the novel coronavirus.
The interactive map allows users to identify the case rate per 100,000 residents in cities and communities or by ZIP codes. The map also shows where each area falls under the different state tiers and whether their case rate and testing positivity are going up or down.
“Cities had previously requested the map to determine how they are faring during the pandemic,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The map gives cities a clearer picture of how COVID-19 is impacting their residents and will help them determine whether to take more aggressive actions to enforce the public health guidance to slow the spread of the virus.”
The map is a new tool the County is using to monitor COVID-19 in the region which is experiencing a significant increase in cases.
COVID-19 Cases Set a New Record
On Nov. 10, a record 661 COVID-19 cases were reported in the County, surpassing the 652 cases reported Aug. 7. A total of 620 cases were reported Nov. 11, bringing the two-day total to 1,281.
“We have not seen cases this high in months and it’s a clear indication that COVID-19 is widespread,” Wooten said. “These totals also show people are not following the public health recommendations that we know work to prevent getting and passing COVID-19. Coming in the weeks following Halloween, these results are a warning sign that we need to follow public health guidance throughout the upcoming holiday season.”
The daily case totals being reported now clearly show that the County, which is now in the state’s most restrictive Purple Tier, is likely to remain there for the foreseeable future.
Because the County’s case rate increased to 7.4, then 8.9 over the past two weeks, the region must stop indoor operations at restaurants, gyms, places of worship and movie theaters starting Sat., Nov. 14. Retailers will need to keep customers at 25% of capacity.
The County will remain in the Purple Tier for at least three weeks. It won’t be able to advance to the Red Tier unless it posts a case rate below 7 cases per 100,000 residents two weeks in a row.
“San Diegans should be wearing a mask, staying away from others and avoiding gatherings,” said Wooten. “We don’t have a vaccine yet and we need to remain vigilant to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”
The California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, Nov. 17.
Other State Metrics:

The testing positivity percentage is 2.6%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 6.5% and it’s in the Red Tier or Tier 2. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

Seven new community outbreaks were confirmed on Nov. 11: three in retail settings, two in business settings and two in food processing settings.
16 community outbreaks were confirmed Nov. 10: six in business settings, four in retail settings, two in restaurant/bar settings, one in a restaurant setting, one in a TK-12 school setting, one in a gym and one in a health care setting.
In the past seven days (Nov. 5 through Nov. 11), 49 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.

Testing:

17,908 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 11, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 3%.
13,754 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 10, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 5%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 3.7%. Target is less than 8.0%.
The 7-day, daily average of tests is 12,600.
People with and without symptoms who are at higher risk for COVID-19 should be tested. Health care and essential workers should also get a test, as well as people who had close contact to a positive case or live in communities that are being highly impacted.

Cases:

620 new cases were confirmed among San Diego County residents on Nov. 11. The region’s total is now 62,334.
661 cases were reported Nov. 10.
4,130 or 6.6% of all cases have required hospitalization.
948 or 1.5% of all cases and 23% of hospitalized cases had to be admitted to an intensive care unit.

Deaths:

No new deaths were reported in the County on Nov. 11. The region’s total remains 918.
Three deaths were reported Nov. 10.
Three men died between Nov. 7 and Nov. 10. Their ages ranged from mid-50s to mid-70s.
All had underlying medical conditions.

354,VIDEO: Computers for Foster Kids,Several local foster families received an early holiday present today: a computer.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/computers-for-foster-kids/,2020-11-12T17:08:45-08:00,"
Several local foster families received an early holiday present today: a computer.
The families received the free computers as part of the 20th annual Computers for Foster Families Program. The collaborative effort between the County of San Diego and the San Diego County Futures Foundation is especially important this year, as many children are distance learning due to COVID-19.
Started in 2001 by San Diego County Supervisor Greg Cox, the Computers for Foster Families Program aims to improve the lives of foster children and their families through the gift of technology. The initiative supports foster families by increasing computer and internet access for some of the region’s most vulnerable children.
The computers, which were formerly used by County employees, are refurbished by the San Diego County Futures Foundation before they are distributed to foster families.

355,State Association of Counties Recognizes Five Innovative County Programs ,"Five San Diego County programs were chosen by the California State Association of Counties for  2020 Challenge Awards, highlighting innovation among programs developed and implemented in county government.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/state-association-of-counties-recognizes-five-innovative-county-programs/,2020-11-13T09:00:41-08:00,"
Five San Diego County programs were chosen by the California State Association of Counties for  2020 Challenge Awards, highlighting innovation among programs developed and implemented in county government.    
San Diego County received the second most awards this year. Los Angeles County received seven. In total, 49 programs from 25 counties were awarded this year.  
The Love Your Heart, Heart Health Awareness program received a Challenge Award in the Health and Human Services category. The Love Your Heart annual campaign was launched on Valentine’s Day 2012 to address the negative impacts of heart disease in the region. Partnering organizations and businesses provide volunteers to check blood pressures, collect data, and help promote the availability of blood pressure sites in a variety of locations and settings to ensure broad accessibility. The inaugural year, 1,000 blood pressure readings were taken at the event. In 2020, through the help of hundreds of volunteers, there were more than 56,000 blood pressure readings completed across 542 sites in the United States and Mexico. Of these, more than 5,441 hypertensive cases were identified and referred to urgent or emergency care, as appropriate. 
CSAC also gave a Merit Award in the same category to the Health and Human Services Agency for its Stopping the Incarcerated Homeless Mentally Ill Cycle program. The program provides inmates who have been diagnosed with a mental illness immediate housing upon their release from jail. This is accomplished with peer-led care coordination and system navigation in the community to connect participants to permanent housing and supportive services. The Community Care Coordination program team is led by HHSA and teams up with the Sheriff’s Department and the Office of the Public Defender. The program continues to work with people for up to 12 months after their release from custody to ensure they are getting appropriate care.
The Probation Department’s Promoting Youth Success with Alternatives to Detention Program earned a Merit Award in the Administration of Justice and Public Safety Category. The program provides youth with needed services from community providers to reduce youth contact with the juvenile justice system. This ultimately reduces recidivism and the youth’s time in custody. Additionally, it lowers costs associated with detaining youth in custody. 
The Virtual Recreation Center program received a Merit Award in the Government Finance, Administration and Technology category. When COVID-19 restrictions closed local parks in the spring and restricted events and regular parks programming, the Department of Parks and Recreation figured out a way to continue offering its content online using its website, social media and videoconferencing. Parks offered talks with rangers using videoconferencing, re-imagined the Summer Movies in the Park to Summer Movies at Home, offering fun recipes for families to try out as an added option. Parks also offered interactive content such as a trivia contest on social media with a local hiking author, ranger-led talks using Facebook Live and virtual hike videos to entice people to explore safely once trails were reopened.   
The Accessory Dwelling Unit Program accepted a Merit Award in the Housing, Land Use and Infrastructure category. The Planning and Development Services Department’s program provides several cost and time saving incentives from permit waivers to pre-approved plans to expedited plan check services for property owners who build additional dwellings, often referred to as granny flats, on their properties.  By encouraging people to build accessory dwellings on their property, it helps with the shortage of affordable housing.

357,More San Diegans Dying Because of Meth,"Record numbers of San Diegans are dying because of meth, according to new figures that show the highly addictive drug’s increasingly harmful impact on the region.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/more-san-diegans-dying-because-of-meth/,2020-11-13T14:08:25-08:00,"
Record numbers of San Diegans are dying because of meth, according to new figures that show the highly addictive drug’s increasingly harmful impact on the region.
A total of 546 San Diegans died from meth last year, 63 more than the previous record of 483 set in 2018.
This is the key finding in the San Diego County Methamphetamine Strike Force’s latest report, which was released today outside the County Administration Center.
The 2020 report card shows the leading indicators of meth problems in the region.
“There’s no sugarcoating it: Meth is destroying lives and families at a record pace here in San Diego County,” said Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who in 1996 spearheaded the creation of the Methamphetamine Strike Force to combat meth problems in the region. “Local law enforcement and treatment services are on the front lines battling this scourge, but clearly we need to do even more as a region.”
According to the Medical Examiner’s Office, the people most impacted by meth are those 45 years of age and older, which represented 319 of the total meth-related deaths. The reason is that people in this age bracket tend to have had chronic cardiovascular disease, which itself could have resulted from long-time methamphetamine abuse.
The 2020 Meth Report Card also shows:

There were 13,020 emergency room visits due to methamphetamines in 2018 compared to 12,926 in 2017. Data from 2019 won’t be available until 2021.
A total of 6,591 people were admitted to County-funded treatment programs due to meth abuse last year, vs. 6,906 in 2018.
59% of adult arrestees tested positive for meth in 2019, compared to 57% the previous year.
11% of juvenile arrestees tested positive for meth in 2019, compared to 10% in 2018.
Meth arrests for selling and possession of meth increased to 11,313 in 2019 vs. 10,156 the year before.

Most Meth Coming from Mexico
San Diego County has had a long history with meth and the problems that come along with it. While the region is no longer considered the “Meth Capital of the World,” and little meth is produced locally, there is more meth available, and it is more potent and cheaper than ever.
The highly addictive and deadly drug is being manufactured and smuggled across the border by Mexican drug cartels. Today, most of the methamphetamine in San Diego County is coming from Mexico.
According to the Drug Enforcement Administration, methamphetamine seizures at U.S.-Mexico ports of entry nearly doubled in 2019. More than 34,000 kilograms were seized in 2019 compared to more than 19,000 kilograms the year before.
With availability going up and prices coming down, meth is having more negative consequences in San Diego families and communities.
Treatment is Available
The County funds residential and outpatient treatment programs across the region to help people recover from substance use disorders. Participation in a recovery program also improves overall health.
People who want to anonymously report meth or drug activity are encouraged to call the Meth Hotline at (877) NO-2-METH or visit www.no2meth.org. Substance use treatment resources are available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1.

360,COVID-19 Fatigue Causing Cases to Skyrocket,"Over the last seven days, the number of COVID-19 cases skyrocketed, reaching a record 1,087 cases Nov. 14 and followed by 833 cases Nov. 15.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-fatigue-causing-cases-to-skyrocket/,2020-11-16T17:52:46-08:00,"
Too many San Diegans are failing to take sufficient measures to protect themselves from getting or passing COVID-19.
That’s the explanation County health officials gave today for the record number of COVID-19 cases that have been reported recently.
Over the last seven days, the number of COVID-19 cases skyrocketed, reaching a record 1,087 cases Nov. 14 and followed by 833 cases Nov. 15. More than 600 cases have been reported every single day in the past week. In the last seven days, 5,031 cases were reported, compared to 3,161 the previous week.
“Exactly a month ago, we sounded the alarm about the possibility of entering the purple tier and last Tuesday we confirmed that we had moved to the most restrictive tier. I had hoped those warnings would lead to a new trend our personal and collective behavior,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer “Over the last weeks, we have seen the results of what can happen when we relax our personal behaviors and let down our guard.”
COVID-19 cases have been drastically increasing across the region, the state and the nation. California is now a sea of purple with 41 counties being in the most restrictive Purple Tier.

That’s why County health officials are strongly urging San Diegans to follow the public health guidance. That includes:

Wearing a face covering
Staying six feet apart from others outside your household
Washing your hands frequently
Avoiding crowds, gatherings or groups
Staying home if you are sick

“Understand that you are taking action not because I ask you, but because the different entities that comprise the vital fabric of our community need you to take action. It’s that simple,” Wooten pleaded. “COVID-19 stops with you. Please do your part to ensure we slow the spread of COVID-19. We cannot afford to waste another minute.”
Report Businesses Not Following Health Order
The County is stepping up its enforcement efforts to make sure businesses and other entities are following the local health order.
The County will be issuing more cease and desist orders to local businesses for failure to comply. If businesses continue to ignore the public health order, the County will issue closure orders. A list of cease and desist orders now available at www.coronavirus-sd.com.
Additionally, letters were issued to all local law enforcement agencies asking them to help enforce the local health order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and drive the number of cases down.
San Diegans may report, anonymously, businesses or entities that are not following the local health order.
You can do it by calling (858) 694-2900 or emailing at SafeReopeningComplianceTeam@sdcounty.ca.gov

363,Board Approves Otay Ranch Village Resort 13 Development,"San Diego County supervisors approved a project this week that could build nearly 1,900 “zero-net-energy” solar-powered homes, condos, commercial space, parks, trails, open space, a school site, a fire/sheriff’s station and a hotel in South County.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-approves-otay-ranch-village-resort-13-development/,2020-11-19T14:12:10-08:00,"
San Diego County supervisors approved a project Wednesday that could build nearly 1,900 “zero-net-energy” solar-powered homes, condos, commercial space, parks, trails, open space, a school site, a fire/sheriff’s station and a hotel in South County between the City of Chula Vista and Jamul.
The County of San Diego’s Board of Supervisors voted 4-1 Wednesday to approve the Otay Ranch Resort Village 13 project. The project has long been anticipated under the Otay Ranch Plan the Board adopted in 1993, was included in the County’s 2011 general plan and fits within the County’s 1997 South County Multiple Species Conservation Plan.
Supervisors Greg Cox, Dianne Jacob, Kristin Gaspar and Jim Desmond voted to approve the project. Supervisor Nathan Fletcher voted to oppose the project.
The project is located on 1,938 acres in the unincorporated county 2.5 miles east of State Route 125 and Interstate 805, just east of the City of Chula Vista and 12 miles southeast of Jamul.
The project plans to build 1,881 all-electric, solar-powered homes, 57 multi-family units, 20,000 square feet of commercial space in a village core, 25 acres of public and private parks, nine miles of community trails and pathways and 860 acres of open space.
The project’s homes would include solar panels with wiring for solar battery storage systems that could make them self-sustaining; no natural gas; electrical vehicle (EV) charging stations in half the homes and the other half EV ready, drought-tolerant landscaping and water-efficient irrigation systems.
The project would also include a 10-acre school site, a 6.1 acre homeowners association facility, a 2.5 acre joint use fire station and sheriff’s storefront and a 16 acre, 200-room resort hotel with outdoor plazas and retail space. County officials said the project expects to be built in phases over the next 8 to 10 years, depending upon market conditions.

364,County Stepping Up Health Order Enforcement,The County has stepped up its enforcement efforts to make sure businesses and other entities are following the local health order.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-stepping-up-health-order-enforcement/,2020-11-19T17:07:31-08:00,"
Indoor operations at restaurants, gyms, places of worship and movie theaters are currently not allowed as part of efforts to curb the spread of COVID-19.
That is why the County has stepped up its enforcement efforts to make sure businesses and other entities are following the local health order.
To date, the County has issued more than 70 cease and desist and closure orders to local businesses and organizations for failure to comply. Over 40 of those were served this week.
When a business or entity is reported, the County investigates and determines whether to issue a cease and desist order. If one is issued, and the entity continues to violate the local health order, a closure notice is issued. A list of cease and desist and closure orders is available at the County’s corovavirus site.
“We are ramping up and enhancing compliance as well as testing given the surge in cases,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We have not seen numbers like these in the course of the pandemic.”
Additionally, all local law enforcement agencies have been asked to help enforce the local health order.
The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department will be sending enforcement teams throughout the region to help ensure the public health guidance is followed. The teams will first encourage compliance but will issue citations if necessary.
San Diegans are encouraged to report businesses or entities that are not following the local health order. Reports can be anonymous.
They can do it by calling (858) 694-2900 or emailing at SafeReopeningComplianceTeam@sdcounty.ca.gov

365,New Annual Report-Tale of Two Counties,The County of San Diego’s new 2019-2020 Annual Report shows the striking difference between the beginning of the fiscal year and the end – what could be called a tale of two counties.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-annual-report-tale-of-two-counties/,2020-11-20T09:57:24-08:00,"
The County of San Diego’s new 2019-2020 Annual Report shows the striking difference between the beginning of the fiscal year and the end – what could be called a tale of two counties.
As the County hummed along meeting its many goals to serve the public, COVID-19 and the ensuing economic crisis hit our region. A spate of police killings led to renewed calls for social justice and racial equity worldwide. These upheavals completely changed the way we do business.
The County went into rapid emergency response mode to protect public health and, at the same time, found new innovative ways to continue offering the many services the public has come to expect.
The County began investing $100 million into the T3 strategy – test, trace and treat – to reduce the spread of COVID-19. At-risk businesses could apply for economic help. Struggling renters in the unincorporated area saw a moratorium on evictions. And the County made broad changes to address inequities in the region.
Before these unforeseen challenges, the Annual Report looks into the County’s strides in meeting or exceeding goals in five of its priority areas: helping the most vulnerable in the region, improving housing affordability, transforming the public safety and justice system, protecting our natural resources and investing in our neighborhoods.
This past year, the County addressed the increased need for behavioral health services, bolstered aid to those experiencing homelessness, and began transforming its juvenile justice and foster care systems.
More affordable housing became available as part of the County’s goal to double the number of units over five years to more than 5,000.
A community air protection program expanded, a new electric vehicle roadmap was approved, and 354 tons of air pollutant emissions were removed.
The County opened its first archive and first bike park. Construction is underway for a new fire station and phase one of a juvenile justice campus. A new library is planned for Lakeside and the Southeastern Live Well Center is going into the design phase.
The Annual Report also allows you to meet the County Board of Supervisors, outlines how departments are organized and lists our top awards. Easy-to-read financial charts show where your tax dollars go.
Check out the Annual Report online and see just how the County is fulfilling a promise of a region that is healthy, safe and thriving. And, get in-depth information about the County’s latest budget plans in the adopted operational plan.

366,Thanksgiving’s Different but Safe Cooking Never Changes; Take our Quiz!,"Thanksgiving is definitely going to look very different this year. But if you're cooking, doing it safely never changes. Take our cooking safely quiz to find out if you're ready!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/thanksgivings-different-but-safe-cooking-never-changes-take-our-quiz/,2020-11-20T11:04:35-08:00,"
Thanksgiving is definitely going to look very different this year. Zoom and virtual visits with extended family and friends. Fewer people around our tables — ideally, just our immediate households.
But adjusting the holidays to fight COVID-19 doesn’t mean you can’t cook a Thanksgiving meal!
And if you’re the chef, remember — use safe-cooking rules like, “keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold, keep meats and veggies separated during food prep, and practice good hygiene.”
Because the last thing you want to do, after fighting COVID and staying safe, is to accidentally serve up helpings of bacteria like E. coli, listeria and salmonella that can turn your meals into heaping plates of food-borne illness!
With that in mind, the County’s Department of Environmental Health is offering its annual (and fun) safe-Thanksgiving cooking quiz to help you prepare.
Here you go!
What’s the best way to thaw frozen meat? (this year’s smaller turkey, Cornish game hen, whatever…)

Put it out on the counter, don’t let anyone touch it and wait till the outside is mushy-soft.
Run hot water over it until it gets mushy-soft.
Let it sit in a pot of water until it gets (wait for it…) mushy-soft!
Let it defrost in the fridge. Meats, poultry and fish should be defrosted in the refrigerator. (If it’s a big turkey, for at least 24 hours for every five pounds in weight.)

Answer: D, of course. Using the refrigerator to thaw slowly and evenly is the best, safest way to defrost any meat. Because bacteria can grow exponentially at room temperatures.  Note: The United States Department of Agriculture says that you can also thaw meats in cold water. But — and this is important — the water must be cold, under 40 degrees, and should be changed every 30 minutes to keep it cold. The refrigerator’s easier!
How often should you wash your hands and cutting boards when preparing food?

You don’t have to wash your hands and cutting boards. A few germs will toughen up your immune system!
Before you start cooking.
After you pet the dog, the cat, the gerbil or pick up the kids.
If you sneeze, blow your nose or have to run to the restroom.
Everything except answer A, but mainly, “OFTEN.”

Answer: Definitely E. (Get out of the kitchen if you answered A) You should wash your hands and cutting boards before and after everything in B, C and D. Handwashing is always a key part of safe cooking. And this year, with COVID? It’s important even if you’re not cooking! So wash your hands. Harmful bacteria, from E. coli to salmonella and staphylococcus aureus, as well as viruses, can be removed from people’s hands through proper handwashing.
Here are just a few other things you should wash your hands after doing: coughing, blowing your nose, using the restroom handling money, eating, drinking, smoking and handling or preparing raw food.
Should you rinse off fruits and vegetables?

Not if they look clean.
Nah, the supermarket washes them, right?
Nope. They grew in nature. That’s good enough for me.
Yes. You should rinse fruits and vegetables with cold water to remove lingering dirt that can carry bacteria.

Answer: Absolutely D. Rinsing with cold water cleans off dirt and other contaminants. But don’t wash them with detergents or soap, even dishwashing soap. You could end up eating residues from those cleaners if they’re absorbed by fruits and vegetables.
Why should you keep raw meats and meat products separated from fruits and vegetables when cutting them up or preparing them?

Meat can make your veggies taste weird. Or veggies can make your meat taste weird. Either way, weird.
Face it, meats and fruits and vegetables just don’t like each other. Last thing you need is a food fight.
Because raw meats, meat products and blood can carry bacteria like E. coli and salmonella that can contaminate fruits and vegetables — and make people sick.
You do not have to. It’s called “marinade.”

Answer: The correct answer is C. (If you said D, again — get out of the kitchen.) Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness, according to the USDA. That is, the transfer of harmful bacteria from one food, particularly raw meats, poultry and shellfish to other foods. When preparing food, you need to keep raw meats and their juices away from fruits and vegetables and all ready-to-eat foods. Not socially-distant away (you don’t need 6 feet), but still, apart.
If you can, use separate cutting boards for meats and produce. If you can’t, wash cutting boards with hot, soapy water after using them on raw meats and before using them to cut fruits and vegetables!
What is the Danger Zone? And what does it have to do with Thanksgiving dinner?

The Danger Zone is that classic 1996 adventure-thriller movie starring Robert Downey Jr. and Billy Zane! It has nothing to do with Thanksgiving … (We know, you were hoping for “that song from the 80s movie “Top Gun.” We figured it was time to change it up…)
It’s that toy-strewn distance you have to traverse, carrying all the Thanksgiving food from your kitchen to the table, without dropping everything!
It’s the range of temperatures between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit — the temperatures where bacteria can grow like crazy in foods, doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes.

Answer: The correct answer is C. We love a good adventure-thriller movie as much as you do. But the Danger Zone is the range of temperature between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit that allows bacteria to breed exponentially — not a good thing. If hot foods cool or cold foods heat up enough to enter that zone, your food can become a bacteria-fest. And you can end up getting sick. Keep hot foods safely heated with chafing dishes, preheated steam tables, warming trays, slow cookers and ovens. Place cold foods in containers on ice, or in the fridge. And refrigerate leftovers as soon as you can, but definitely within two hours. Here’s more about the “Danger Zone.”
And finally:
Is the “five-second rule” real? Can you eat something you’ve dropped on the floor if you pick it up in less than five seconds?

Yes. It is definitely real. Just pick it up quick and blow on it. Nothing can contaminate your food in less than five seconds. Uncle Dave taught me that.
It’s not real. And you really shouldn’t eat anything you’ve dropped on floor. (Sorry Uncle Dave.)
My dogs eat everything off the floor and I’ve never seen them get sick.

Answer: B. It’s OK for the dog to eat food that’s fallen to the ground but it’s not safe for people. Truth is, almost any contact is long enough for food to be contaminated by bacteria that can be found on the ground or in your house. According to research conducted this year by Rutgers University, bacteria can transfer from a surface to food in less than a second!
So there you have it. We hope you’re an expert. But if you’re still interested, you can get more information about food safety tips at FoodSafety.gov’s “Food Safety by Types of Food” webpage, or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry hotline at 1-888-674-6854.
Be safe. And have a good Thanksgiving!

Restaurants, bars, wineries, distilleries and breweries must close to sit-down customers from 10 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. Businesses can offer take-out, drive-thru and delivery at any time.

The measures are intended to help reverse the recent rapid increase of COVID-19 activity in the region and will be in effect for 30 days.
Thanksgiving Guidance
The County has issued COVID-19 guidance for Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays.
Anyone hosting a gathering should keep it small, short and safe.
Small means gatherings should be limited to a maximum of three stable households. Short means the gathering should last two hours or less. Safe means that people should stay outdoors as much as possible and wear a face covering when they are not eating or drinking.
Other recommendations include:

Remote events with family and friends, such as a virtual dinner, sharing recipes, a virtual turkey trot or online game

368,Board Approves Plan to Boost Youth Civic Involvement,The County Board of Supervisors recently approved a framework that will boost youth civic engagement and leadership opportunities in the County.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-approves-plan-to-boost-youth-civic-involvement/,2020-11-23T13:30:47-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors recently approved a framework that will boost youth civic engagement and leadership opportunities in the County. The Live Well San Diego Youth Sector is designed to amplify the voices of San Diegans under the age of 25 and to encourage young people to get involved in civic activities.
More than half a million San Diegans between the ages of 15 and 24 call the County home.
The Live Well San Diego Youth Sector will provide leadership and training ​opportunities, encourage participation on boards and commissions​, and match young people with mentors who work in County government, or are community leaders.
The County will also hire two part-time youth advisors who will work with County staff in the Live Well San Diego Support Team to inform the strategy and development of the Youth Sector.
Marabella de la Rea, 16, got involved in the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector during one of more than three dozen County-hosted listening sessions that were part of the planning process for the initiative. She became interested in participating because the initiative provides young people with opportunities to grow and learn from each other.
“The Live Well San Diego Youth Sector is an extremely important addition to our society as it allows youth to gain opportunities that they didn’t have before,” said de la Rea. “I’m motivated to advocate for youth voices and the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector because I believe that stronger communities begin with young people and their perspectives.”
Now that the framework for the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector has been approved, the next step is a youth-led session. That will take place during the Let’s Hear From You(th)! presentation at the virtual Live Well Advance on Dec. 3 at 3:30 p.m.
County residents, 14 to 24 years old, are invited to register for the youth-led online workshop and share their input, which will be used to help inform critical decisions about the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector.

Given the surge in cases and hospitalizations due to COVID-19, County health officials are urging San Diegans to keep Thanksgiving and other holiday celebrations small, short and safe.
“There should be a small number of people and gatherings should be short in duration,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We are asking people to please follow the public health guidance to provide a safe experience for everyone attending the gathering.”
Gatherings with members of your own household represent a lower risk of getting and passing COVID-19. But if you’re going to gather, Wooten said you should take precautions to lower the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The smaller the better, and the health order calls for no more than three households, with gatherings outside when possible. They should be short and not last longer than two hours. And attendees should be safe and wear a face covering when not eating or drinking, maintain social distance, and practice good hand hygiene.
“If you are sick, stay home and avoid any non-household gathering or event,” Wooten said.
The County has issued COVID-19 guidance for Thanksgiving and other upcoming holidays.

370,Design Work on County Southeastern Live Well Center Resumes,"The County of San Diego, along with PCL Construction Services, Inc. and architects Steinberg Hart, are revising the Southeastern Live Well Center project.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/design-work-on-county-southeastern-live-well-center-resumes/,2020-11-24T09:07:19-08:00,"
The County of San Diego, along with PCL Construction Services, Inc. and architects Steinberg Hart, are revising the Southeastern Live Well Center project.
The new design retains the full array of community services while reducing the amount of space for back-office staff who are now expected to telework.
“The COVID-19 pandemic has showed us that many employees can effectively work from home and prefer that arrangement,” said Supervisor Greg Cox, chairman of the Board of Supervisors. “This redesign acknowledges that trend without reducing services to the public.”
The size of the public and client areas in the 65,000-square-foot Southeastern Live Well Center will remain the same as in the earlier 80,000-square-foot design.
“My priority has been to push for services at the new facility that reflect the needs and wants of the neighborhood,” said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher. “I’m committed to ensuring the project retains those resources and to adding even more between now and opening day.”
Because County employees who do not interface with clients will now primarily work from home, this new office model shrinks the workspace and support area requirements originally anticipated. The County has tasked PCL Construction and Steinberg Hart to make the necessary changes without impacting the overall design concept.
Unchanged will be the site layout with its public plaza and entrance near the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Market Street, the exterior façade design with its welcoming public entrance, and the public lobby with its grand stair soaked in daylight from the second story skylights.
Also unchanged are plans for a 4,000 square-foot Conference Center and installation of public art. Other Community amenities will include the Meditation and Wellness Garden, connection of Chollas Creek Trail to Market Street, and a coffee cart at the public plaza near Market Street and Euclid Avenue.

Traffic studies for the Southeastern Live Well Center project were conducted during the planning of the project. As a result, street improvements will include medians on Euclid Avenue from Highway 94 to Imperial Avenue and a traffic signal on Market at the entrance of the west driveway for the Malcom X Library. The project also will provide Fair Share contributions for future traffic improvements on Market Street’s intersections with 47th Street and Euclid Avenue.
The Tubman Chavez Community Center is providing an essential service as a COVID testing site for the Southeastern Community. Prior to start of construction there will a new location in the community for COVID testing.
Information about the new Southeastern Live Well Center, its design and opportunities for public comment are available on a dedicated Live Well San Diego website.
Services Available at the Center
The Southeastern Live Well Center is expected to break ground in summer of 2021 and open in the summer of 2023. The County’s contract with PCL for this center includes a commitment for local hiring and subcontracting participation from the project’s four local Zip codes; 92102, 92113, 92114 and 92139. The contract requires $6 million of participation from those areas.
As part of this endeavor PCL Construction and Steinberg Hart also are reaching out to subcontractors, including local subcontractors, to assist in design re-development and re-budgeting efforts for the 65,000 square-foot building.
Services that will be available include medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities and military and veterans’ services. The Southeastern Live Well Center also will include space for community meetings in the 4,000-square-foot conference center.
Live Well Centers are operating in National City, Chula Vista, Escondido, and the recently remodeled Lemon Grove location. A new Live Well Center is also under construction in Oceanside.

371,"County Rental Assistance Available to Additional 10,000 Households","San Diego County residents who are economically impacted by COVID-19 could qualify for assistance of up to $3,000 to pay for past-due or upcoming rent.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-rental-assistance-available-to-additional-10000-households/,2020-11-24T10:14:08-08:00,"
San Diego County residents who are economically impacted by COVID-19 could qualify for assistance of up to $3,000 to pay for past-due or upcoming rent.
The County will be accepting new applications for the Emergency Rental Assistance Program starting December 1, 2020. Interested people can find more information about the program and apply starting at www.SDHCD.org.
Because of the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, many residents have been unable to pay rent, which can cause them to be evicted and lead to an increase in homelessness.
Understanding the financial burden for both tenants and landlords, the County of San Diego Board of Supervisors allocated $27 million in funding for an Emergency Rental Assistance Program to ease that burden for thousands of county residents.
The County is anticipating awarding over $10 million in assistance to residents that applied during the first round of applications at the beginning of October.
For the new round of funding, the County will review applications as they are received and will continue to take applications until funds are depleted. Those who apply will be able to check their application status online at any point in the process.
To be eligible, households must be renting and have experienced a financial hardship directly related to COVID-19. This includes a loss or reduction of income due to COVID-19, or an increase in medical expenses incurred as a direct result of COVID-19.
Households must also fall under 60% Area Median Income to qualify. For example, to be eligible, a single-person household can earn up to $48,540 and a four-person household can earn up to $69,300. The program will be able to assist about 10,000 households.
Residents who live in cities with their own COVID-19 rental relief program would not be eligible for the County program unless their cities’ funds have already been depleted.
Also, applicants must not receive any other forms of housing subsidy, such as Section 8, or other rental assistance programs, rapid rehousing assistance or rental assistance from nonprofit agencies.
Only one application per household will be accepted and the applicant’s landlord must agree to participate in the program for the County of San Diego to process the emergency rental assistance grant.

372,Local COVID-19 Cases Hit Another Record Ahead of Thanksgiving,"The County Health and Human Services Agency confirmed 1,546 new COVID-19 cases today, surpassing the previous record of 1,478 cases set just last Friday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/local-covid-19-cases-hit-another-record-ahead-of-thanksgiving/,2020-11-24T17:34:02-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency confirmed 1,546 new COVID-19 cases today, surpassing the previous record of 1,478 cases set just last Friday. The continuing surge of cases and hospitalizations is pushing the County further into the state’s most restrictive Purple Tier.
New data released by the state Tuesday shows the County’s adjusted case rate has increased to 13.1 cases per 100,000 residents. This is a 2.4-point increase over last week.
“The continuing spike in cases ahead of this week’s holiday is alarming and it is vital that all San Diegans commit themselves to the public health guidance,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The sooner we lower our case rates, the sooner we will be able to lift restrictions and reopen our businesses.”
State Metrics:

Under the state’s system for determining COVID-19 risk, San Diego County is the Purple Tier, or Tier 1. The state uses the more restrictive measure of case rate or testing positivity to assign tiers regarding what activities are permitted. Indoor operations at restaurants, gyms, places of worship and movie theaters are currently not allowed.
The County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 13.1 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1 for that metric.
The testing positivity percentage is 3.1%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier for that metric.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 9.3% and it’s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance.
The California Department of Public Health announced that tier assignments, typically given each Tuesday, may now occur any day of the week and may occur more than once a week.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

Fifteen new community outbreaks were confirmed on Nov. 23: three in retail settings, three in business settings, three in restaurant/bar settings, two in restaurant settings, one in a government setting, one in a grocery setting, one in a faith-based agency setting and one in a TK-12 school setting.
In the past seven days (Nov. 17 through Nov. 23), 73 community outbreaks were confirmed.

373,Remaining Members Selected for County Redistricting Commission,All 14 of the required members for the County’s new Independent Redistricting Commission are now on board. The final six were selected on Friday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/remaining-members-selected-for-county-redistricting-commission/,2020-11-25T10:22:17-08:00,"
All 14 of the required members for the County’s new Independent Redistricting Commission are now on board. The final six were selected on Friday.
The commission is responsible for redrawing the boundaries of the County’s five supervisorial districts. The districts are required to have relatively equal populations and meet other legal standards. District lines must be re-evaluated every 10 years after new federal census numbers are released.
The 2020 census will show whether the populations of the districts are out of balance and how the characteristics of the population of each district may have changed.
Nearly 300 residents applied for the commission. The Clerk of the Board of Supervisors selected 60 of the most qualified applicants. Staff then drew eight names from the pool during two random drawings at the Oct. 13 Board of Supervisors meeting.
The eight new commissioners had the responsibility of selecting the remaining six members based on a number of requirements specified by the California Elections Code.
The law requires the new commissioners’ political party registration to be as proportional as possible to the number of County voters registered with each political party or registered as no party preference.
Commissioners are also required to have relevant experience, analytical skills, the ability to be impartial and experience that demonstrates an appreciation for the diverse demographics and geography of the County of San Diego.
The six who met these requirements and were selected by the initial eight commissioners are:

Elidia Dostal
Carmen-Rosette Garcia
Kenneth Inman
Kristina Kruglyak
Fernandez Ponds
Ramesses Surban

The makeup of the overall commission largely reflects the county’s diversity.

The commission is evenly split between seven women and seven men. The average age is 58 years old.
The full commission will hold its next meeting in mid-December. The public may sign up for email updates, watch virtually or participate via teleconference.
Before the Redistricting Commission draws a draft map, it must hold at least seven public hearings with at least one hearing in each supervisorial district. Other meetings, dates and times are at the discretion of the commission.
The group will review the new census data when it’s released and start the process on redrawing new maps for the five supervisorial districts. The maps must be completed by Dec. 15, 2021.

374,"New, Improved Lakeside Library to Start Construction in Spring","In a few months, the County of San Diego will start a new chapter for Lakeside residents and their library, starting construction on a new library three times larger than the current branch, with a community room for events, a bookstore and large spaces for children and teens.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-improved-lakeside-library-to-start-construction-in-spring/,2020-11-25T11:03:13-08:00,"
In a few months, the County of San Diego will start a new chapter for Lakeside residents and their library, beginning construction on a new 16,400-square-foot library three times larger than the current branch, with a community room for events, a bookstore and large spaces for children and teens.
“Libraries are not just a place for books anymore,” said County Supervisor Dianne Jacob. “They’re a place for children to do their homework, they’re gathering places. And a lot of resources will come into this community as a result of the new library, because it will be bigger and better.”
County officials say construction is expected to start in spring 2021 and be completed in summer 2022.
The County’s Board of Supervisors voted to buy the land to build the new library in September 2017, when Jacob called it a project “near and dear to me and many folks in Lakeside.”
The new $19 million facility will be a be a solar-powered “zero net-energy building,” with a 2,000-square-foot community room that can seat 150 people. The community room alone is a little less than one-half the size of the current 5,000-square-foot Lakeside library that was built in 1962. The new library will be built just a few blocks away from the current branch on Woodside Road near Channel Road.
In addition to the community room, the new library will include five study rooms, a conference room, a patio, a Friends of the Library bookstore and public art. It will also feature the latest in library technology, including automated book returns, a laptop kiosk, an audio-visual system and digital signage.
County Library Director Migell Acosta said the community room will be able to be used for numerous types of events: cultural, musical, dance, educational and lectures.

375,Board Approves More Funds for Businesses Impacted by COVID-19,The County Board of Supervisors today voted to provide more stimulus funds to businesses forced to close indoor operations after the region was placed in the Purple Tier.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-approves-more-funds-for-businesses-impacted-by-covid-19/,2020-11-25T16:10:51-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today voted to provide more stimulus funds to businesses forced to close indoor operations after the region was placed in the Purple Tier.
At a special meeting, the Board gave the green light for $20 million in general funds to be added to the Small Business Stimulus Grant Program established in May.
The funds will be available to businesses and nonprofit organizations in the following industries:

Restaurants
Gyms and fitness centers, including yoga studios
Movie theaters
Museums
Zoos and aquariums
Event planners (weddings, festivals, fairs, etc.)

Businesses in these industries had to close or stop indoor operations to limit the spread of COVID-19. The financial relief will help them to reverse some of the disproportional impact on their operations and keep some from having to close permanently.
The County’s five supervisorial district offices will review and recommend applicants for $4 million in funds each. Applications are available at the Small Business Stimulus Grant Program website. Award recipients will also be posted on the site.
Businesses that submitted a previous application do not need to reapply.
This is the fourth time the Board has voted to provide stimulus grant funds for restaurants and other small businesses. In past months, the Board approved a total of $27.5 million in Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security or CARES Act funds.

If you traveled or gathered with people outside your household over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, you were at higher risk of having contracted COVID-19 and could inadvertently be spreading it.
That’s why it’s important that you get tested and decrease unnecessary activities this week to avoid spreading the virus.
“By getting tested, people will know whether they have contracted COVID-19 and prevent spreading the virus to others,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should also wear a face covering, maintain social distance, avoid crowds and monitor for symptoms.”

378,"Take Precautions, Be Prepared During Red Flag Conditions",Extreme low humidity and forecasted high winds will result in elevated wildfire danger and a red flag warning through Saturday in the San Diego County mountains and inland valleys.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/take-precautions-be-prepared-during-red-flag-conditions/,2020-12-02T12:09:12-08:00,"
Extreme low humidity and forecasted high winds will result in elevated wildfire danger and a red flag warning through Saturday in the San Diego County mountains and inland valleys.
Residents are asked to be alert for wildfires and to take steps around their homes and properties to reduce the risk of wildfire. Be careful to restrict use of certain power tools since they can sometimes spark fires.
What you can do now is cut away and remove dead and dying plants near your home and other structures, but only by using hand tools since power tools, including lawn mowers, can potentially spark on rock and start a grass fire.
Remove dead leaves and other debris leading up to your home, including wood piles that may be stacked against structures. These things can all be ignited by embers from a wildfire.
Be particularly careful with smoking materials to avoid accidentally starting a fire.
Never pull your vehicle over in grass as it can ignite a grass fire. Make sure your vehicle is well maintained as faulty catalytic converters have been a major cause of accidental fires in San Diego County.
Also, if you have a trailer on your vehicle, make sure the chains don’t drag on the ground while driving and spark a fire.
An important way to prepare is to stay informed in the event of a regional emergency.
Register for AlertSanDiego or ListoSanDiego, the County’s cell phone notification service. By doing that, you will receive any emergency messages such as evacuation warnings that apply to your neighborhood on your cell phone.
Residents can download the County’s SD Emergency app in English or Spanish from the Google Play store or the Apple App Store. The app provides news updates, maps, shelter locations and includes disaster planning templates and interactive checklists. If a regional emergency, such as a wildfire, does occur, updates and other information will be posted at sdcountyemergency.com and sent out via the app.
Don’t wait until an emergency, when you’re already stressed to figure out what you need to do in the event of an evacuation. Complete a family disaster plan template from the app or from ReadySanDiego.org to help your family plan for an emergency including where to meet if you are separated and cannot return home.
To find more information about safeguarding your home from wildfires and general disaster preparation, visit ReadySanDiego.org.
You can also stay in touch with official emergency information by following CAL FIRE on Twitter in the event of a fire. More weather forecast information and updates are available at the National Weather Service.

379,COVID-19 Hospitalizations Rapidly Rising as County Waits for Vaccine,"Due to the increasing number of cases and hospitalizations, County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to follow the recommended guidance to prevent getting and spreading the novel coronavirus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-hospitalizations-rapidly-rising-as-county-waits-for-vaccine/,2020-12-02T17:31:20-08:00,"
Due to the increasing number of cases and hospitalizations, County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to follow the recommended guidance to prevent getting and spreading the novel coronavirus.
Over the past seven days, the region has averaged more than 1,300 COVID-19 cases each day.
Hospitalizations have also steadily risen in recent weeks. A total of 739 San Diegans was hospitalized for COVID-19 as of Dec. 1, compared to 288 Nov. 1, an increase of 451 in the hospitalized population, or 156.6%. This figure is likely to go up since hospitalizations lag behind confirmation of cases.
The number of people in intensive care units has also increased. While there were 93 San Diegans in the ICU at the beginning of November, the figure has more than doubled in the past 30 days to 209.
“Unfortunately, with the increase in cases, there have been more hospitalizations and ICU admissions,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
San Diegans are encouraged to follow the following guidelines to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19:

If you’re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.
If you need to be in public, you must use a face covering if you are close to people outside your household. The coverings help prevent asymptomatic carriers of the virus from spreading it.
Maintain physical distance from others.
Avoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw it away and wash your hands.
Wash your hands properly and regularly or use a hand sanitizer.

COVID-19 Vaccine Arriving in San Diego
The state anticipates getting approximately 327,000 doses in mid‐December during the first distribution round. Of those, the County is expected to get about 28,000 doses.
Distribution of COVID-19 vaccine will be done in phases, with the first doses going to health care personnel and nursing home residents and employees. The initial distribution will not be sufficient to vaccinate all eligible health care workers.
The state anticipates the second round of vaccines to follow about three weeks after the first round.
State Metrics:

Under the state’s system for determining COVID-19 risk, San Diego County is the Purple Tier, or Tier 1.

Indoor operations at restaurants, gyms, places of worship and movie theaters are currently not allowed.
The County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 15.3 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1 for that metric.
The testing positivity percentage is 2.3%, placing it in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier for that metric.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 10.6% and it’s in the Purple Tier or Tier 1. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.
The California Department of Public Health announces tier assignments at least once a week.

The order will go into effect Monday and will last for at least three weeks or until the region’s ICU capacity meets or exceeds 15%. The order will be assessed by the state on a weekly basis after the three-week period.
“Lives are at stake, so this action is necessary,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., medical director of Epidemiology and Immunization Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “We must restrict our activities and avoid contact with others to reduce transmissions of COVID-19.”
Among restrictions that go beyond the current Purple Tier that already apply to San Diego:

No gatherings of any size.
Restaurants open for takeout, delivery or drive-thru only. No on-site dining.

A total of 2,287 COVID-19 confirmed cases were reported Dec. 4, surpassing the record 2,039 cases reported the previous day. The region’s total is now 90,468.
“These high numbers are likely the result of the cooler weather and increased social interactions, particularly during the Thanksgiving holiday,” McDonald said. “We’re seeing new daily cases reported in the 2,000s. We cannot let this trend become the new normal.”
McDonald urged San Diegans with COVID-19 symptoms and those who traveled or attended Thanksgiving gatherings to get tested immediately to prevent from spreading the virus to others.

384,San Diegans Urged to Get a Flu Shot,"While influenza activity in the region is extremely low compared to other seasons, County health officials are urging San Diegans to get vaccinated to prevent getting sick.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-get-a-flu-shot/,2020-12-08T09:30:57-08:00,"
While influenza activity in the region is extremely low compared to other seasons, County health officials are urging San Diegans to get vaccinated to prevent getting sick.
Dec. 6 through Dec. 12 is National Influenza Vaccination Week and a perfect time for you and your family to get a flu shot.
“With widespread transmission of novel coronavirus in our community, it’s so important everyone over six months old get a flu shot this year,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.  “Every flu case prevented means more resources available to defeat COVID-19. And not only are you safer but you are helping others.”
Influenza is a serious respiratory illness and can make you very sick, cause you to miss work, school, and time that should be spent enjoying the holiday season. The flu can even be deadly for some people. Last season in San Diego County, 108 people died from the flu.
“The flu vaccine is the best way to protect against influenza,” Wooten said.
Your Best Shot Against the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

 
The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 211 San Diego.
Tips to Prevent the Flu 
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

Last season, a total of 20,711 lab-confirmed flu cases were reported in the region.

Tuesday’s actions establish a tobacco retail licensing program, or TRL, that will allow the Board to regulate the operation of businesses that sell tobacco products. The TRL will require business owners to obtain a permit and stay in compliance with federal, state, and local tobacco control and youth tobacco access laws, or risk the suspension of their license.
The TRL will also cap the number of establishments that can sell tobacco products in the unincorporated area to 330 businesses.
In addition to prohibiting the in-person sale of tobacco and flavored tobacco products to those 21 or younger, the ordinance will ban the placement of tobacco vending machines in the unincorporated area of the county. Businesses that have onsite pharmacies will no longer be allowed to sell tobacco products.
The TRL will be transferable among immediate family members, as long as the business location does not change. The new owner will also have to meet the age requirement for selling tobacco products, meaning a TRL will not be transferable to anyone under the age of 21.
The Board action also establishes an age requirement for clerks who sell tobacco products. Salesclerks who are under the age of 18 will be allowed to sell tobacco products to those of legal age, as long as the clerk is under continuous supervision by someone 21 or older.
The new regulations will go into effect in July of next year.

388,COVID-19 Vaccine: Who is Getting It First?,The novel coronavirus vaccine is expected to arrive in San Diego County soon. Distribution of COVID-19 vaccine will be done in phases.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-vaccine-who-is-getting-it-first/,2020-12-09T17:51:53-08:00,"
The novel coronavirus vaccine is expected to arrive in San Diego County soon.
Distribution of COVID-19 vaccine will be done in phases. The vaccine allocation was determined by the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), which advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on the distribution of all vaccines.
Phase 1A, 1B and 1C:
The County is expected to get about 28,000 doses of a vaccine made by Pfizer in the next few days, after it receives emergency use authorization. Critical care health workers will be the first people to get it, followed by long-term care facility residents and employees. As other pharmaceutical companies receive emergency use authorization, more vaccines will arrive in the region.
The initial distribution will not be sufficient to vaccinate all people in these populations. However, the state anticipates the second round of vaccines to follow about three weeks after the first round.
If the ACIP approves the remaining recommendations, and once people in the first two groups in Phase 1A are vaccinated and more COVID-19 vaccine doses are available, they will go to essential workers (Phase 1B). These are people who work in education, food and agriculture, police officers, firefighters, correctional officers and transportation workers, among others.
After that, the priority will be to vaccinate adults with underlying medical conditions and people over the age of 65 because they are at higher risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19 (Phase 1C).
Phase 2:
Immunizations will then be available for children and young adults under the age of 30 and then for critical workers not included in Phase 1 or Phase 2.
Phase 3:
The final phase will be people of all ages who live in the United States.
The phases could be revised as the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices determines if some groups are at higher risk from COVID-19 and therefore would need to be vaccinated sooner.
The CDC anticipates that by June of 2021, everyone wanting to get vaccinated against COVID-19 should be able to do so.
Is the COVID-19 Vaccine Safe?
The Pfizer vaccine coming to San Diego County is administered via two shots in the arm and research has shown that it’s about 95% effective.
The vaccine is safe, but about 10% to 15% of people may have some side effects such as fever, fatigue, headache and muscle pain. These symptoms should go away on their own after a couple of days.
Once people in the United States start to get vaccinated, the CDC will expand its safety surveillance to make sure the vaccine is working as it should.
“This initial COVID-19 vaccine distribution will give us one more tool to try to slow the spread of the pandemic,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “However, it’s important that people continue practicing the recommendations we’ve given to prevent getting and spreading the virus until we have achieved herd immunity.”

391,Holiday Magic Needed to Help Houdini the Husky Disappear From the Shelter … And Reappear in a Special Dog Owner’s Home,"Houdini, a 3-year-old neutered male husky, is looking for the best gift of all this holiday season: a forever home.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/holiday-magic-needed-to-help-houdini-the-husky-disappear-from-the-shelter-and-reappear-in-a-special-dog-owners-home/,2020-12-11T09:29:32-08:00,"
Houdini, a 3-year-old neutered male husky, is looking for the best gift of all this holiday season: a forever home.
Don’t just look at his handsome face and get mesmerized by his ice-blue eyes. That has happened too many times for him, seven times in fact – when people came in, fell in love with his looks and then returned him when they were unable to meet his needs as an active dog.
“He just needs a patient, compassionate new owner that is willing to commit to addressing his special needs,” said Kelly Campbell, Director of the Department of Animal Services. “We here at the County of San Diego Department of Animal Services would like to find the perfect adopter or foster family for Houdini. It would have to be a person or persons who are active, experienced with the breed, experienced with dog training and willing to be dedicated to helping Houdini become the best dog that he can be.  We truly believe he has the potential to be an amazing addition to the family, if he could only find his perfect, devoted companion.”
So, what is his story? He earned his name at DAS after the first family to take him in, returned him for his uncanny ability to escape. He’d even jump out of a second story window taking the screen down with him. Houdini’s adventurous nature may also have given some of his previous owners the wrong impression. He had been returned several times because  he seemed unable to quickly form a bond with his new owner. But to be fair to Houdini, many of his adoptions were relatively short, most of them a matter of days Having been through six previous families, it is entirely possible Houdini viewed his adoptions as a mini adventure and his “home” as the shelter.
Donald Davis, a supervising animal attendant who works with Houdini regularly, said he is not the same dog who jumped out of the window. Davis said he has mellowed out some since that occurred, but Houdini still has a lot of energy. Animal services officers call him an “extreme” husky, meaning he exhibits all his breed-specific traits which include being vocal, having a high energy level, having limited patience, and shedding a lot. His high energy level would be perfect for a running companion or someone with a large, fully enclosed and very secure backyard. He understands and responds to commands and would be trainable with the right person.
In fact, DAS has a trainer who has evaluated his personality and is willing to work with whoever adopts or fosters him at no cost to the adopter through the Spirit Fund,  which helps animals with veterinary or behavioral needs.
Due to COVID-19 precautions, DAS is offering touchless adoptions. If you would like to submit your application to be considered to adopt or foster Houdini, please visit the DAS website www.sddac.com and follow the instructions to complete and submit an adoption or foster care application. Houdini’s digits are Kennel 51, Tag Number 969 and Animal Identification Number A1868183.

A record 2,867 COVID-19 cases were reported Dec. 10, bringing the region’s overall total to 102,466, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The new one-day total eclipses the previous record set on Dec. 4 when 2,287 cases were reported.
“The extremely high number of cases shows that San Diegans are not following the guidance we’ve given. Protect yourself and others. The virus is everywhere,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Staying at home with people from your own household is a must. People should not be out in public unless it is absolutely necessary.”
Wooten reiterated San Diegans should not be having gatherings of any size since they are prohibited by the Regional Stay Home Order and are contributing to the spread of the virus.
She encouraged people to continue doing the following to prevent getting COVID-19 and passing it to others:

If you’re sick, stay home and isolate yourself from others.
If you need to be in public, you must use a face mask if you are close to people outside your household. The masks help prevent asymptomatic carriers from spreading the virus.
Maintain social distance from others.
Avoid crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.
Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, throw it away and wash your hands.
Wash your hands properly and regularly or use hand sanitizer.
If you’re out and about and notice that a business is not following the health guidance, report them by calling (858) 694-2900 or emailing SafeReopeningComplianceTeam@sdcounty.ca.gov.

“Our actions matter and can impact our local hospitalizations and intensive care bed capacity,” Wooten said.

393,28K COVID-19 Vaccine Doses Arriving in San Diego,The first deliveries of vaccine for the novel coronavirus have started to arrive in San Diego.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/28k-covid-19-vaccine-doses-arriving-in-san-diego/,2020-12-14T14:48:23-08:00,"
The first deliveries of vaccine for the novel coronavirus have started to arrive in San Diego.
Over the next few days, the region will get about 28,000 of the 327,000 doses of the recently authorized Pfizer vaccine coming to California.
“The arrival of the vaccine is great news and will give us the best tool to slow the spread of the pandemic,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “However, this does not mean people should not continue taking the necessary precautions to avoid getting COVID-19.”
The initial doses will go to acute health care personnel. Those doses are about 72% of what is needed to administer the first dose of all identified heath care recipients in the first tier.
Each health care system will decide how to prioritize and administer the vaccines to its employees in the Phase 1A – Tier 1 guidelines. All 28,000 recipients will get their second dose when more Pfizer vaccine arrives in the region.
The initial shipments of the 28,000 vaccine doses are being delivered to the County, UC San Diego Health and Rady Children’s Hospital. The County is storing about 12,000 doses of vaccine in subzero freezers and will redistribute it to regional acute health care hospitals.
County employees unpack more than 12,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine to be stored in subzero freezers. They will go to regional acute health care hospitals.
Residents and employees of skilled nursing facilities also have the highest priority to receive the new vaccine, but distribution to these recipients is being handled separately by the state.
Those doses will go to local CVS and Walgreens pharmacies which will administer the vaccine to skilled nursing facility residents and staff.
As other pharmaceutical companies receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, more vaccines will arrive in the region.

About 82,600 San Diegans who work at acute health care settings will be the first to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus.
The initial 28,000 doses being delivered to the region are being used to vaccinate 72% of the nearly 40,000 people working in acute care, psychiatric and correctional facility hospitals and are at highest risk of contracting COVID-19. This group includes about 180 employees at the County Psychiatric Hospital.
“We first have to vaccinate our acute health care personnel who are at highest risk,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “After everyone in that group has gotten their first dose, we will move into our next priority group.”
After this first group is vaccinated, additional doses coming into the region will also be used to immunize more personnel in acute health care settings, including 14,000 employees at high risk of getting COVID-19, followed by 14,000 employees at medium risk and another 14,000 employees who are lower risk.
Each health care system is responsible for how it prioritizes and administers the vaccines to its employees in the Phase 1A – Tier 1 guidelines. All 28,000 recipients in the initial group will get their second dose when more Pfizer vaccine arrives in the region.
An employee at the County Psychiatric Hospital gets her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine.
The County is still in the process of determining how many people fall into the Phase 1A-Tier 1 priority group, as well as the number of San Diegans who are part of Tier 2 and Tier 3.
Residents and employees of skilled nursing facilities are also part of the first priority group. The majority will be vaccinated under federal contracts by staff from local CVS and Walgreens pharmacies.
As other pharmaceutical companies receive emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, more vaccines will arrive in the region.
When the vaccine is available to the general public, which is expected to happen in spring 2021, people will be able to get the vaccine from their health care provider, local pharmacies, community clinics or County vaccination sites. In some cases, employers may provide them to employees.

396,Dangerous Bacteria Outbreak Reported in Local Dogs,"An outbreak of leptospirosis, a contagious bacterial disease, has been reported in dogs in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/dangerous-bacteria-outbreak-reported-in-local-dogs/,2020-12-17T15:09:33-08:00,"
An outbreak of leptospirosis, a contagious bacterial disease, has been reported in dogs in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
Since October, 34 confirmed and probable cases of leptospirosis have been documented among local dogs, primarily in the Hillcrest and Mission Hills areas. Several dogs required hospitalization and at least one was euthanized.
Boarding at kennels that allow dog-to-dog interaction is a major risk factor, though some ill dogs only had contact with other dogs at dog parks. The kennels that were linked to cases notified the owners of all potential contacts of diagnosed cases and closed for at least two weeks for cleaning and disinfection.
Signs of leptospirosis in dogs are varied and can include fever, muscle weakness, vomiting and diarrhea, loss of appetite, low energy, and frequent urination, which may be bloody.
No human cases have been linked to this outbreak in dogs, but anyone who develops fever, headache, muscle aches (especially in the back and calves), or other illness after contact with a sick dog should see their health care provider.
This week, HHSA sent a health advisory to local physicians and veterinarians about the outbreak.
Leptospirosis is a disease caused by various species of spirochete bacteria called Leptospira. These bacteria can infect multiple species of mammals, including humans, dogs, rats, mice, raccoons, skunks, and opossums.  The bacteria are shed in the urine of infected animals and may contaminate food, water, soil or bedding. Dogs and people can get infected through direct contact with skin abrasions, mucous membranes, or drinking contaminated water.
“When dogs visit kennels and parks and play, lick, and sniff each other, they are at risk of getting these bacteria,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If your dog shows any signs, you should take it to your vet immediately.”
A vaccine is available to prevent leptospirosis in dogs, especially for those boarding in kennels and frequenting dog parks.

398,"To Protect Mental, Physical Wellness, Stay Close from Afar","The novel coronavirus pandemic has forced us into isolation and kept us away from family and friends. That can make for a difficult holiday season, which is usually spent gathering with others and is often the only time some family members see each other.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/to-protect-mental-physical-wellness-stay-close-from-afar/,2020-12-18T09:49:19-08:00,"
The novel coronavirus pandemic has forced us into isolation and kept us away from family and friends.
That can make for a difficult holiday season, which is usually spent gathering with others and is often the only time some family members see each other.
Mental health experts say it’s important to stay connected and reinforcing those relationships can make it easier to get through this challenging time.
“Reach out to your loved ones and do it often,” said Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services for the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency. “It can help you, and them, feel less lonely and isolated while the stay-at-home order is in place.”
Bergmann emphasized that it is particularly important that we not pit our mental health against our public health.
“The most important thing we can do for the community’s long-term mental wellness is to observe public health orders and get this pandemic under control,” Bergmann said.
But in the shorter-term, the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to be stressful for people and communities. Bergmann said it’s important for people to monitor their physical and mental health and to stay as connected as possible while staying physically distant.
“We are encouraging everyone to be in contact with their friends and loved ones, but to please do it from afar,” he said.
Behavioral Health Services offers the following tips for managing mental wellness while being isolated:

Pause, take deep breaths and notice how you feel.
Talk or video chat with people you trust about your feelings and concerns.
Don’t be glued to the radio, TV or other news outlets. Take a break from content that might be upsetting.
Make time for yourself and unwind. Listen to music and do other activities you enjoy while following the public health guidance.
Take care of your body and exercise on a regular basis. Moderate-to-vigorous physical activity can help to reduce anxiety and stress.
Rest and get plenty of sleep. Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time, even on weekends.
Eat healthy and well-balanced meals. Avoid drugs and, if you drink, do it in moderation.

If you or someone you care about are feeling overwhelmed with sadness, depression or anxiety, seek professional help, especially if distress is impacting your daily activities for days or weeks.
Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health resources and support are still readily available through County Behavioral Health Services and its many service providers.
You can talk to a trained counselor by calling the County’s 24-hour, multi-lingual Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240. Other resources are available on Behavioral Health Services’ COVID-19 Resources for Families, Parents & Caregivers webpage or the It’s Up to Us website.

399,Residential KnoxBoxes Allow Firefighters to Get to Residents in Distress,"If someone in a home suffers a medical emergency, they may be able to push a medical alert button or call 911, but unable to get to the door when help arrives.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/residential-knoxboxes-allow-firefighters-to-get-to-residents-in-distress/,2020-12-18T12:47:33-08:00,"
If someone in a home suffers a medical emergency, they may be able to push a medical alert button or call 911, but unable to get to the door when help arrives.
San Diego County Fire is now offering qualifying residents a secure key safe called a KnoxBox that will allow first responders to gain access to a home within seconds in a life-threatening or critical situation.
“When someone is having a medical emergency and becomes pulseless and apneic,  it’s really important for us to get in there and provide medical attention within 4-6 minutes and it’s costing us minutes to get in when we are having to break a door down,” said County Fire Deputy Chief Dave Nissen, who has worked in the rural East County communities for 30 years.
“Looking at it from an evacuee position, we can get in there as well if a house is imminently threatened by fire or other types of emergencies and move people out who may not be able to move themselves,” said Nissen.
County Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who represents communities protected by San Diego County Fire, said this program will truly benefit people in need in the backcountry.
“For older folks with chronic health conditions or in need of help with basic activities, KnoxBoxes can be a lifesaver,” said Jacob. “These devices can also provide some peace of mind in a region where wildfire is a year-round threat.”
The program aligns with the County’s commitment to living safely, one of four strategic plan initiatives, and is offered at no cost to qualifying residents. County Fire installs the box just on or near the front door and can only be opened by local firefighters responding to life-threatening emergencies.
The KnoxBoxes can either be installed on a door or on a wall next to the front door.
The concern about firefighters being able to gain access to their home was on Nancy Weir’s mind when she called her local fire station on Palomar Mountain. Initially, she just wanted to make sure they could get past a complicated gate system used by several homes including her own. In talking to the captain, she mentioned that she is recovering from a concussion that can cause various degrees of dizziness and fainting.
“I just wanted to be sure if I was home alone with the doors locked, the fire department could easily get in without busting my door down,” Weir said.
She said the captain came by to look at the gate and suggested she would be a perfect candidate for the residential KnoxBox program which she had not heard about. She signed up and soon enough someone from the fire station came by to install it.
“I feel a lot safer now knowing they know how to get in the gate and how to get in my house and what my issues are,” Weir said. “It’s all great now, not only for medical relief but we have a super high fire risk here.”
County Fire received a federal grant to help buy an initial 200 KnoxBoxes. The agency loans the boxes to participants to help reduce risk in their rural communities. The program launched in October and has received over 70 applicants so far, and more than 25 have been installed in communities such as Potrero, Jamul and Warner Springs. To qualify, residents must:

Live in San Diego County Fire, Ramona Municipal Water District, or Deer Springs Fire Protection District coverage areas.
Be any of the following:

At least 62 years old
Have a disability
Need assistance with one or more Major Life Activity



To apply for the program or for more information, call San Diego County Fire at (858) 974-5744 or email FireCRR@sdcounty.ca.gov. People can also visit the San Diego County Fire Authority site to obtain an application and read more information on the program.

401,Continued FEMA Rental Assistance May be Available for Valley Fire Survivors,Survivors of the September Valley Fire who are currently receiving Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rental assistance for temporary housing as part of the Individuals and Households Program may be able to extend their current benefits into the new year.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/continued-fema-rental-assistance-may-be-available-for-valley-fire-survivors/,2020-12-21T11:21:16-08:00,"
Survivors of the September Valley Fire who are currently receiving Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) rental assistance for temporary housing as part of the Individuals and Households Program may be able to extend their current benefits into the new year.
Some San Diego County residents may qualify for continued assistance if they can demonstrate a fire-related financial need and show that they have developed and/or are making progress toward a long-term housing plan.
According to FEMA, a long-term housing plan is one that would put the survivor back into permanent safe, sanitary, and functional housing within a reasonable timeframe. Individuals requesting a continuation of their current benefits must show progress toward obtaining permanent housing, and a contractor estimate of repairs can point to progress.
Individuals who are currently receiving FEMA rental assistance and have an ongoing need should follow the steps below:

Contact FEMA.
Provide proof that previous assistance funding was spent on rent.
Provide an updated status on a permanent housing plan.

Extensions on rental assistance may be granted for three-month periods, up to a maximum of 18 months from the date of the presidential declaration, which was October 16, 2020, for the Valley Fire.
The application must be accompanied by these supporting documents:

Pre-disaster and current household income status.
Copies of pre-disaster mortgage or lease, utility bills, and insurance information.
Copy of current lease or rental agreement signed by you and the landlord.
Copies of rental receipts, canceled checks or money orders showing the rental assistance was used to pay for housing expenses.

County residents requesting an extension should submit the documents by using their existing DisasterAssistance.gov account or by uploading the information via the FEMA app on a smartphone or tablet.
Homeowners whose FEMA verified loss exceeds the amount of the initial rental assistance award they received will receive the continuation application in the mail after the initial rental assistance award has been granted. Homeowners whose verified loss does not exceed the initial rental award must call the FEMA Helpline at 800-621-3362 (TTY: 800-462-7585) and ask for an application for continued temporary rental assistance.
Renters will also need to call the helpline to ask for an application for continued temporary rental assistance. Requests will be evaluated to determine eligibility for the extension, but there is no guarantee of rental assistance past the first two months.

402,County Reports Show Steps Needed to Address Health Inequities in San Diego,The County Health and Human Services Agency today published two comprehensive reports that show the progress and work needed to reduce health inequalities in the region and improve the quality of life of all San Diegans.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reports-show-steps-needed-to-address-health-inequities-in-san-diego/,2020-12-21T14:27:38-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency today published two comprehensive reports that show the progress and work needed to reduce health inequalities in the region and improve the quality of life of all San Diegans.
The Community Health Assessment (CHA) report includes morbidity, demographic and health data of residents and communities in the region. The data was used to develop the strategic framework of the second report – the Community Health Improvement Plan (CHIP). These two documents, as well as Public Health Services’ Strategic Plan, are a requirement for national, voluntary public health accreditation.
The reports also show the importance of community engagement and planning to enhance opportunities for residents to improve their health, live safely and thrive, the three components of the County’s Live Well San Diego vision.
“These plans are reflections of the leadership and dedication of our communities to the lives of our fellow San Diegans,” said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency. “These regional plans will continue to be living documents that evolve to reflect future strategies within each region to create safe, healthy and thriving communities.”

In the Community Health Improvement Plan, regional community leadership teams produced enrichment plans, many of them already underway, that lay out priorities to help each region address the most important issues in their communities.
They include:

Improve access to quality care
Increase physical activity and support healthy eating
Stop tobacco, alcohol and other drug use
Protect residents from crime and abuse and increase neighborhood safety
Create communities that are resilient in disasters and emergencies
Improve built and natural environment
Increase prosperity and improve education levels and the economy

“The CHA documents the local health status and priorities for improvement in San Diego County,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. County public health officer. “The CHIP explains the community planning process to address regional priorities, with attention to health equity. It describes the important role that the Leadership Teams play in driving action on the ground. The CHIP also captures how collective impact is to be measured and describes the foundational infrastructure that supports success.”
Both reports will also be used to help the County Health and Human Services Agency retain its accreditation status from the national Public Health Accreditation Board, which it first received in May 2016.
Earning public health accreditation is a rigorous process and the County is now applying to be re-accredited as is required every five years.
The national accreditation process was developed in recognition of the importance of having a strong infrastructure to address public health challenges. These include protecting the public from infectious and chronic diseases, responding to emergencies and advancing health equity across a diverse population.

403,County Boosts Ability to Staff Emergency Shelters,The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services (OES) has significantly improved the ability to open and maintain emergency shelters and local assistance centers in the county by increasing their number of qualified shelter workers and managers by 67% as of Dec. 1.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-boosts-ability-to-staff-emergency-shelters/,2020-12-21T16:17:51-08:00,"
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services (OES) has significantly improved the ability to open and maintain emergency shelters and local assistance centers in the county by increasing their number of qualified shelter workers and managers by 67% as of Dec. 1.
Despite the constant threat of wildfires and additional COVID-19 social distancing requirements creating an increased demand for shelters and thus shelter workers, OES has managed to increase the number of County employees who are qualified to work at and manage emergency shelters from 420 to 702 personnel in 2020.
“While the American Red Cross serves as our primary source for providing emergency shelter during an emergency, this increase in qualified personnel to our County Shelter Team program helps to improve our rapid response capabilities,” said Jeff Toney, San Diego County OES director. “This large increase in qualified personnel will allow us to be better prepared to open and operate additional facilities when the demand exceeds the resources provided by the Red Cross.”
Toney said that all County workers are classified as disaster service workers, but the qualification process to become a shelter worker or shelter manager is in place to ensure that County residents are living safely and receive timely crisis response and recovery services. The training and qualification process to become a shelter worker, which now includes a specific pandemic section, is constantly being updated to ensure the highest quality of service for County residents.
Toney also said most of the county’s qualified shelter workers and managers come from departments outside of OES. The training teaches them how to recognize needs, take action, and ensure county residents are living safely with increased preparedness and response capabilities provided by OES.
“I became involved with the shelter team program during the 2003 wildfires in San Diego and have assisted with several County-established local assistance centers since then,” said Luis Ochoa, a supervising child support officer with the county’s Department of Child Support Services. “I don’t like to see anyone suffer, especially those stricken by disaster and I feel a strong desire to assist in any way I can.”
Ochoa said he has previously worked in several roles as part of the program, including as an intake coordinator, interpreter and runner. In 2018 he was trained as an assistant local assistance center manager, and in the recent Valley Fire in September he was asked to take on the lead role as center manager.
OES encourages all families in the county to have an emergency plan and practice it so it is familiar in a high-stress situation. Additionally, all County residents are encouraged to register their cellphones on AlertSanDiego, the County’s emergency notification system and download the SD Emergency App at no cost. An emergency family plan template is available in English, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese, Farsi, French, Korean, Somali and in an audio version.

404,County Receives Its First Shipment of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine,The County of San Diego on Monday received its first deliveries of the second COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-receives-its-first-shipment-of-moderna-covid-19-vaccine/,2020-12-21T17:56:22-08:00,"
The County of San Diego on Monday received its first deliveries of the second COVID-19 vaccine approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
The Moderna vaccine was approved by the FDA for emergency use late last week and by the Advisory Committee to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this weekend.
The County received 20,000 doses in this first shipment of the first allocation of 43,700 Moderna vaccines to the region. Some local health care systems had vaccines shipped directly to them.
These 43,700 doses of Moderna’s vaccine are in addition to the roughly 28,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine that started arriving in San Diego County last week.
Like the Pfizer vaccine, the Moderna vaccine requires two doses for each recipient. Healthcare providers will ensure that recipients receive both doses from the same manufacturer, appropriately spaced apart.
Moderna’s vaccines are administered 28 days apart, while Pfizer’s vaccine is given 21 days apart. The initial doses of both vaccines will be distributed based on Phase 1A – Tier 1 guidelines.
“The arrival of the Moderna vaccine gives us another vital tool in fighting COVID-19 and protecting those who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While the arrival of more COVID-19 vaccines is good news, it will take months until the general public will get vaccinated.”
Until vaccines are more widely available and herd immunity is achieved, Wooten is urging San Diegans to follow the public health guidelines that have been proven to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus. These strategies include:

Washing your hands properly and regularly or using hand sanitizer.
Maintaining social distance from others.
Wearing facial coverings.
Avoiding crowded places to decrease your risk of exposure.
Staying home and isolating yourself from others if you are sick and get tested.

ICU Capacity and Stay Home Order:

In the past seven days (Dec. 14 through Dec. 20), 40 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.

Testing:

28,383 tests were reported to the County on Dec. 20, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 11%.

405,Free COVID-19 Testing Available Over Holidays,"Free COVID-19 testing will continue to be offered seven days a week by the County throughout the holidays, with fewer locations and shorter hours on certain days.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/free-covid-19-testing-available-over-holidays/,2020-12-22T13:27:57-08:00,"
Free COVID-19 testing will continue to be offered seven days a week by the County throughout the holidays, with fewer locations and shorter hours on certain days.
On Dec. 24 and Dec. 31, sites will operate on a regular schedule, with each closing at 4 p.m.
On Dec. 25, three sites – University of San Diego, San Marcos and Southeastern San Diego – will be open from 10:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
On Jan. 1, five sites – Tubman-Chavez Community Center, Lemon Grove, the University of San Diego site in Linda Vista, Imperial Beach and Vista – will be open from 10 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.
Walk-in testing sites do not require appointments. However, as of Dec. 20, nearly all drive-up COVID-19 testing sites have become appointment-only locations. This change is in response to safety concerns caused by traffic backups. Appointments are accepted up to three days in advance with new appointments becoming available each day about noon.
The exception to the appointment-only drive-up testing will be sites operated by the San Diego County Fire Protection District. While appointments are highly recommended, and those with them are given preference, people without appointments will be tested as capacity permits.
“With vaccine distribution in its very earliest stage, COVID-19 testing remains extremely important to protect the public’s health,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People experiencing any symptoms, or who feel they have been exposed, are encouraged to get promptly tested. Those with symptoms should isolate until getting results, while others should adhere to the best practices of wearing a mask, social distance, and good hygiene.”
Holiday testing demand is expected to be high. Wait times at walk-up locations will exceed an hour at times, and the public’s patience is appreciated.

406,County’s Long-awaited Estrella Park Opens in Casa de Oro,"The County’s long-awaited, newly improved Estrella Park in the Casa de Oro neighborhood in Spring Valley is open.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-long-awaited-estrella-park-opens-in-casa-de-oro/,2020-12-22T14:23:50-08:00,"
The County’s long-awaited, newly improved Estrella Park in the Casa de Oro neighborhood in Spring Valley is open.
County Supervisor Dianne Jacob and a handful of socially distanced County officials gathered at Estrella, which Jacob called “incredible,” late last week to celebrate the opening of the park.
The County spent $1.4 million to turn the one-time 6.6-acre vacant lot into a community park that mirrors the local landscape and creates a nature play area. The park features hills, trees and boulders, rope bridges, a river bridge, slides, picnic area, a “sand beach,” a butterfly canyon, log benches, dog path, trail and amphitheater.
Jacob said Estrella was a great example of the success of the “Green Light for Parks” initiative she and Supervisor Greg Cox introduced and the Board of Supervisors approved in 2017. The initiative led the Board to approve the creation of a $13 million commitment in the County general fund to help overcome maintenance hurdles that stymied some park development, including Estrella.
“Before those actions were in place, we didn’t have the resources we needed to build and maintain this park,” Jacob said. “Parks like Estrella benefit everyone — supporting regional health and safety, and a better quality of life.”
Parks officials said it took about a year to build the park improvements. Construction started in late 2019. They said the park’s features, including the amphitheater, were built into the land’s natural landscape and use those natural features to create unique play spaces, such as balance beams made out of eucalyptus trees, steppers made from tree stumps and logs stacked up a hill for children to clamber up. New, native and drought tolerant plants and trees were also added.
Estrella park also features educational signs that explain resource conservation, point out sustainable landscaping and local wildlife so visitors can learn about and appreciate the plants and animals in the park.
County Parks officials said the County was excited to open Estrella quickly so that the people and families of Casa de Oro could immediately begin enjoying the park they’ve been waiting for.
Estrella Park is scheduled to be open daily from sunrise to sunset and will be patrolled by County Park rangers and local volunteers.

408,Mouse Tests Positive for Hantavirus,"A western harvest mouse collected in routine monitoring has tested positive for hantavirus. County environmental health officials are reminding people not to vacuum or sweep up after rodents if they find them in homes, garages, and sheds. Use wet-cleaning methods instead.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/mouse-tests-positive-for-hantavirus-2/,2020-12-23T10:17:18-08:00,"
A western harvest mouse collected in routine monitoring in open space along the border of Santee and San Diego has tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.
County officials are reminding people that if they find rodents in their homes, garages, sheds or cabins they should never sweep up or vacuum up after them, but use “wet-cleaning” methods instead, to keep from breathing in the virus and getting sick.
Hantavirus is not uncommon in San Diego County; it can potentially cause deadly infections in people and there is no vaccine or cure. However, people are rarely exposed to hantavirus because the main carriers are wild rodents that prefer to live in the wild away from people.
People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed it in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries and is stirred into the air where people can breathe it in. So far in 2020, County environmental health has collected 25 rodents that have tested positive for hantavirus.
County officials said wet cleaning methods include using bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

410,Holiday Celebrations Could Crush ICU Capacity,"If you’re planning a gathering during the upcoming holidays, County health officials say you should cancel it.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/holiday-celebrations-could-crush-icu-capacity/,2020-12-23T17:44:35-08:00,"
If you’re planning a gathering during the upcoming holidays, County health officials say you should cancel it.
Gathering with family or friends from outside your household could lead to a COVID-19 surge in cases and hospitalizations, further straining a local critical care health care system already near capacity.
“I know how difficult this time of year is for so many of us. The holidays are supposed to be a time when we get together with family and friends. This year, things must be different,” Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We know what happens when holidays arrive, and people gather. COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths increase dramatically.”
Since the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed availability for the Southern California region went below 15% and the Regional Stay Home Order went into effect, the situation has continued to worsen.
The ICU bed availability is now zero. The region’s hospitals are being overwhelmed, even after adding more ICU beds.
Here’s what the region experienced in the weeks after Thanksgiving:

44% or about 59,400 of the nearly 146,000 cases since the pandemic’s start occurred after Thanksgiving.
Of the more than 5,500 hospitalizations since the pandemic’s start, about 780 or 14% took place after Thanksgiving.
Of the 1,350 deaths reported since the pandemic’s start, about 330 or 25% happened after Thanksgiving. At the pace deaths are growing, the region is on track to record 600 additional deaths by the end of January.


“We don’t want to see what happened after Thanksgiving happen again. We just had 39 deaths reported in a single day. That is a new record,” Wooten said. “We must continue to stay apart to get the spread of the virus under control. If we don’t, cases, hospitalizations and deaths will continue to soar.”
COVID-19 Vaccines Available in the Region:

Total doses: 102,550 are available as of Dec. 23, 2020.
Pfizer: 29,250 doses; two doses administered three weeks apart.
Moderna: 73,300 doses; two doses given four weeks apart.
The number of doses does not include federal, military and multi-county entities such as Kaiser, as well as the Pharmacy Partnership Program.

413,County Fire Starts New Year with New Name,The year 2021 will mean a new name for the San Diego County Fire Authority as the organization has been recently renamed the San Diego County Fire Protection District.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-fire-starts-new-year-with-new-name/,2020-12-29T08:50:27-08:00,"
The year 2021 will mean a new name for the San Diego County Fire Authority as the organization has been recently renamed the San Diego County Fire Protection District.
The name change became official Dec. 7 when the San Diego Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) voted 8-0 in favor of becoming a dependent special district under the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. LAFCO oversees the establishment and organization of special districts.
“The San Diego County Fire Protection District has been a long time coming,” said Herman Reddick, the district’s director. “It is the natural progression of growth and provides the long-term stability of the organization.”
According to Reddick, in the last five years San Diego County Fire has been able to make significant improvements by increasing permanent career staffing and the assignment of paramedics at all San Diego County Fire Protection District stations and increasing the level of services provided to county residents.
CAL FIRE/San Diego Fire Chief Tony Mecham said the actions to create the new district help to correct a decision made in the 1970s when the County of San Diego terminated the contract with California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection for fire services.
“Supervisor Dianne Jacob and LAFCO began working on this issue in 1993 and after 27 years the fire district has become a reality,” said Mecham. “Last year, the voters in San Diego voted in favor of adding fire protection services to the San Diego County Charter. These two actions will ensure that fire protection services will always be provided across our 1.7-million-acre service area.”
The San Diego County Fire Protection District is comprised of elements from both the State of California and the County of San Diego working in unison as a single organization. More than 500 sworn personnel operate 35 fire stations to ensure San Diego County residents are living safely. The designation as a fire protection district is just one step in County Fire’s continuous efforts to achieve operational excellence in all programs and areas of responsibility.

414,Stay Home Order Extended for San Diego County,"Given the low availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, the Regional Stay Home Order for the Southern California region, including San Diego County, has been extended until further notice.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/stay-home-order-extended-for-san-diego-county/,2020-12-29T16:53:01-08:00,"
Given the low availability of intensive care unit (ICU) beds, the Regional Stay Home Order for the Southern California region, including San Diego County, has been extended until further notice.
Today, the state announced the region’s ICU availability is 0.0%. The San Joaquin Valley region’s stay home order has also been extended.
An ICU availability of 0.0% does not necessarily mean there are no ICU beds available. What it indicates is that hospitals in that region are operating at surge capacities and their ability to treat other ill people – patients with heart attacks, strokes, other traumas, etc.—is limited.
Moving forward the state will make four-week projections using the following regional indicators:

Current ICU capacity
Current 7-day average case rate
Current transmission rate
Current rate of ICU admission

If the four-week projection is at or above 15% of ICU availability, the region may be released from the order. If it’s below, it remains under the order.
However, this does not mean that the region will be under the order for four weeks. It could be shorter if the above indicators improve prior to that timeframe and the 15% threshold is met.
The four-week projection will be calculated by the state daily.
Community Setting Outbreaks:

Three new community outbreaks were confirmed on Dec. 28: two in business settings and one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting.
In the past seven days (Dec. 22 through Dec. 28), 57 community outbreaks were confirmed.
The number of community outbreaks remains above the trigger of seven or more in seven days.
A community setting outbreak is defined as three or more COVID-19 cases in a setting and in people of different households over the past 14 days.

Testing:

16,944 tests were reported to the County on Dec. 28, and the percentage of new laboratory-confirmed cases was 15%.
The 14-day rolling average percentage of positive cases is 10.8%. Target is less than 8.0%.

416,San Diego Man Tests Positive for UK Variant of COVID-19,"A San Diego man with no travel outside the county has tested positive for the COVID-19 variant first identified in the United Kingdom, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-man-tests-positive-for-uk-variant-of-covid-19/,2020-12-30T16:54:30-08:00,"
A San Diego man with no travel outside the county has tested positive for the COVID-19 variant first identified in the United Kingdom, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The man was tested on Dec. 29 after two days of symptoms, and results showed a characteristic pattern that indicated it could be the new UK strain. The specimen was immediately sent to Scripps Research and whole genome sequencing determined Dec. 30 that it is the UK variant, also known as B.1.1.7.
The patient is not hospitalized and is currently isolated. The County’s case investigation has identified household contacts who are being quarantined and tested for the novel coronavirus. The man had little interaction with people outside his household while potentially contagious.
“The B.1.1.7 strain is here, and San Diegans can protect themselves against it by doing the same things they have been asked to do since the pandemic began,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., medical director of the County Epidemiology and Immunizations Services branch. “Everyone should stay home and avoid any gatherings over the New Year’s holiday. The best way to celebrate is to be sure that everyone stays healthy in 2021.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the UK strain is one of multiple COVID-19 variants that have been identified around the world.
There is some evidence that the new strains are more easily spread, but these variants are not believed to cause more severe illness or increase the risk of death.
At this time, it is also believed that the vaccines currently available will offer protection against newly emerging variants. Scientists continue to study the new strains of the novel coronavirus to determine their potential impact.
Since the new strain has a higher rate of transmission, it could lead to an increase in cases in the region. With New Year’s Eve tomorrow, County health officials say San Diegans to do the following now more than ever:

Wash your hands
Wear a mask
Keep your distance from others and leave your household only for essential activities
If you’re sick, get tested, and then stay home and isolate yourself

ICU Capacity and Stay Home Order:

The current intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability for the Southern California region is now 0.0% and will be updated by the state daily.

417,State and County Investigate Citrus Disease in Fallbrook,"State agricultural inspectors have detected bacteria on an insect that can cause a plant disease that is not harmful to people or animals, but is deadly to citrus trees and is a dangerous agricultural threat in routine pest trapping in Fallbrook.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/state-and-county-investigate-citrus-disease-in-fallbrook/,2020-12-31T15:30:49-08:00,"
State agricultural inspectors have detected bacteria on an insect that can cause a plant disease that is not harmful to people or animals, but is deadly to citrus trees and is a dangerous agricultural threat in routine pest trapping in Fallbrook.
A routine spot check by the California Department of Food & Agriculture (CDFA) on December 28 collected a group of four adult Asian citrus psyllids (ACP) from a citrus tree on residential property in the Fallbrook area of San Diego County carrying the bacteria Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus. These bacteria can cause a citrus disease called Huanglongbing (HLB). At this time, the disease has not been detected in citrus trees in San Diego County. Samples from trees on that property and the surrounding area are undergoing tests for the disease, which is fatal to citrus trees and has no cure. Results should be available the week of Jan. 4. If the test results are positive on the foliage, then a 5-mile HLB quarantine will be triggered.
The disease is a major threat to San Diego’s $150 million annual citrus crop and can impact residential citrus tree growers with misshapen, bitter fruit and eventually kill the tree.
“Rapidly detecting and controlling the spread of the Asian citrus psyllids that carries Huanglongbing continues to be a priority for the County.  While ACPs are frequently found in our ongoing mitigation efforts, the bacteria have never been found locally before,” said San Diego Agricultural Commissioner Ha Dang. “We are working closely with our residents, growers, and industry partners to limit any potential impact and will keep everyone informed moving forward,” she added.
The detection of the bacteria triggers additional sampling and testing of both citrus trees and ACP on residential properties in a 250-meter area surrounding the detection site. The County Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM), and CDFA will work with residents in the immediate area to arrange for treatment of citrus trees, on a voluntary basis, as a protective measure against ACP and Huanglongbing infestation. AWM officials are also proactively notifying local citrus growers, plant nurseries and other related businesses. If the disease is detected in citrus trees in the area, agricultural officials will follow up with removal of the infected trees, additional treatment of nearby citrus trees, heightened trapping efforts, and a quarantine to restrict the movement of citrus trees, fruit and foliage.
AWM has been working closely with CDFA and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) on this collaborative project. The first ACPs were detected in San Diego County in 2008, and surveys, insect trapping, tree sampling and other regulatory activities have been ongoing throughout the county since then. The Dec. 28 Fallbrook detection is the first time the bacteria has been found on the pests in San Diego County. It has previously been confirmed in portions of Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
ACPs have been frequently found in San Diego, Imperial, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties.
Citrus trees contract the disease when the bacteria are transmitted into the tree by the ACP insects as they feed. HLB is a bacterial disease that affects the vascular system of citrus plants. HLB-infected trees bear small, asymmetrical fruit which are partially green, bitter, and not fit for sale or consumption. The disease destroys the appearance and economic value of the trees and eventually causes their death, typically within a few years. Infected trees may have areas with mottled yellow leaves, generally seen in asymmetrical patterns.
Residents can take a number of steps to help ward off, or contain, huanglongbing disease including:

Not taking or moving cuttings from backyard citrus plants from one property to another.
Buying citrus trees only from reputable local nurseries.
Cooperating if County (or state) inspectors ask to place insect traps on their land (traps are to find and test Asian citrus psyllid, the insect that can carry citrus greening bacteria).
Reporting citrus trees and plants that seem to be sick or dying even though they also appear to be well-watered and well-maintained by contacting the San Diego Department of Agriculture, Weights, and Measures at (760) 752-4700 or visit sdcawm.org. Residents can also call CDFA’s toll-free Pest Hotline at (800) 491-1899, or visit www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/acp.

The cooperative statewide partnership with agricultural officials and the citrus industry is maintaining its strategy of rapidly detecting and controlling the spread of the ACP and HLB while researchers work to find a cure for the disease.

418,County Reports Record-High Deaths as More Local Cases of New COVID-19 Strain Are Confirmed,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a record-high number of new COVID-19 deaths. The 62 deaths reported today well surpass the previous single-day record of 39 deaths reported on Dec. 22.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reports-record-high-deaths-as-more-local-cases-of-new-covid-19-strain-are-confirmed/,2020-12-31T17:15:10-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a record-high number of new COVID-19 deaths. The 62 deaths reported today well surpass the previous single-day record of 39 deaths reported on Dec. 22.
Meanwhile, whole genome sequencing has detected three new cases of the United Kingdom variant of COVID-19, also known as B.1.1.7., beyond yesterday’s report.
The three newly-confirmed variant cases reported today were initially identified by Helix during diagnostic testing, then confirmed by whole genome sequencing by Scripps Research.
The new cases of the UK strain were found in men, two in their 40s and one in his 50s. Contact tracing shows two men did not travel outside of the county while the third case has yet to be fully interviewed. None of the men had any known interaction with each other or the other confirmed case.
A household contact of the first local B.1.1.7. strain case reported yesterday has been hospitalized for COVID-19, with whole genome sequencing pending.
The discovery of the additional cases leads County Health Officials to believe that the new strain of the virus is widespread in the community. The four individuals who have tested positive for the B.1.1.7. strain live in La Mesa, Mission Beach, Otay Mesa and the Carmel Mountain/Rancho Bernardo area.
“We believe that many more cases of the B. 1.1.7. strain will be confirmed in the coming days and weeks,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., medical director of the County Epidemiology and Immunizations Services branch. “This strain of the virus has been reported to be spread more easily in the UK and so it is therefore crucial that now, more than ever before in this pandemic, we follow the public health orders and keep each other safe.”
In light of the high case numbers and new strain being detected in the region, County health officials urge San Diegans to:

Wash your hands
Wear a mask
Keep your distance from others and leave your household only for essential activities
If you’re sick, get tested, and then stay home and isolate yourself

422,32 COVID-19 Variant Cases Identified in San Diego County,"Twenty-four confirmed and four probable cases of the more contagious strain of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been identified, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/32-covid-19-variant-cases-identified-in-san-diego-county/,2021-01-05T12:39:02-08:00,"
Twenty-four confirmed and four probable cases of the more contagious strain of SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes COVID-19, have been identified in San Diego County, the Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The new cases of the variant that emerged in the United Kingdom, known as B.1.1.7, bring the region’s total to 32. Sixteen are men and 16 are women. The new total includes 28 cases confirmed by whole genome sequencing and four probable cases that are directly linked to the confirmed cases and have positive diagnostic nucleic acid tests, but are not yet sequenced.
Two dozen new variant cases were confirmed on Jan. 4 from specimens collected from Dec. 27 through Dec. 31 and tested at the San Diego-based laboratory Helix and its partner Illumina under a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance project.
There have been no COVID-19 deaths connected to the variant, but one woman had to be hospitalized. She is now at home recovering.
The 24 newly confirmed patients are believed to have no travel history and to have come from 19 different households, but the investigation and contact tracing are ongoing.
New cases have been identified in San Diego, Chula Vista, La Mesa, and Lakeside.  The cases are among multiple age groups. While the four youngest cases are under 10 and the oldest is over 70, the average age of the variant cases to date is 36, the same as the overall average for all confirmed cases in the county to date.
“The fact that these cases have been identified in multiple parts of the region shows that this strain of the virus could be rapidly spreading,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. County public health officer. “People should be extra cautions to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19, especially this variant, which research has shown is more contagious.”
The variant was first identified Dec. 30 in a man in his 30s with no travel history. Three additional cases were announced Dec. 31.
The County has asked all testing labs that have the capability to identify suspect cases of the new strain to forward specimens for genome sequencing to determine if they are indeed cases of the variant. Local doctors have also been requested to forward COVID-19 positive tests from patients with a travel history to the United Kingdom or other places overseas where variants have been detected.
“We are doing everything we can to determine how fast this new strain is spreading, especially since the region’s daily case count has dramatically increased in recent weeks,” Wooten said.
At this time, it believed that the vaccines currently available will offer protection against newly emerging variants. Scientists continue to study the new strains of the novel coronavirus to determine their potential impact.
County health officials say San Diegans should do the following now more than ever:

Keep your distance from others and leave your household only for essential activities
Wear a mask
Wash your hands
If you’re sick, get tested, and then stay home and isolate yourself

423,Board Receives Update on County’s COVID-19 Response,The County Board of Supervisors received its first update of the year on the region’s COVID-19 response.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-receives-update-on-countys-covid-19-response/,2021-01-12T17:18:56-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors received its first update of the year on the region’s COVID-19 response. This was also the first public COVID-19 briefing for the three new board members who were sworn in last week.
The Board voted to increase enforcement on businesses and operations that are not in compliance with the safe reopening plans and extended the Great Plates Delivered program providing free meals and income stipend programs. The Board also voted to ensure that enforcement efforts are being applied consistently based on scientific data around how and where COVID-19 spreads.
Board members also directed staff to look into whether it is possible to exclude businesses that have repeatedly violated public health orders from eligibility for COVID-19 financial assistance programs.
To date, the County has received more than 17,000 complaints about health order violations and the County’s Safe Reopening Compliance Team has issued 335 cease and desist orders. Complaints about violations have exponentially increased since the region moved into the Purple Tier in November, with more than half of all complaints made in the past month.
COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout
Right now vaccine supply remains limited and only San Diegans who fall into Phase 1A of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution can get vaccinated. This includes primarily people who work in health care and employees and residents of long-term care facilities. Healthcare personnel who are eligible to be vaccinated at this time are encouraged to contact their medical provider first to request a vaccination.
Phase 1A eligible residents who are unable to get vaccinated through their health care provider, can make an appointment online at www.VaccinationSuperStationSD.com. Appointments are limited and individuals are encouraged to check the website regularly if they cannot secure an appointment right away.
“We understand that demand for the COVID-19 vaccination is high and that our community has many questions about the vaccination process,” said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency. “The County will roll out a website feature soon that will clarify the tier system and allow the general public to sign up for notifications about when and where they can get their COVID-19 vaccine. A dashboard is also being developed that will show how many San Diegans have been vaccinated with their first and second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.”
ICU Capacity and Stay Home Order:

The current intensive care unit (ICU) bed availability for the Southern California region is 0.0% and will be updated by the state daily.

424,County to Seek Additional Funding for No Place Like Home,The County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted Tuesday to apply for $12 million in additional state funding for the No Place Like Home program.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-seek-additional-funding-for-no-place-like-home/,2021-01-13T12:27:55-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors unanimously voted Tuesday to apply for $12 million in additional state funding for the No Place Like Home program.
No Place Like Home provides funding for the creation of affordable housing units for those with serious mental illness who are experiencing or are at-risk of homelessness.
Tuesday’s authorization also provides County behavioral health supportive services for tenants in No Place Like Home units for a period of 20 years.
The state started the NPLH program in 2018 and offers two funding categories, the Noncompetitive Program allocation and the Competitive Alternative Process County allocation.
The County has already received a one-time $12.7 million Noncompetitive Program allocation and an additional $68 million in the first and second rounds of Competitive Alternative Process County allocations.
Tuesday’s Board action allows the County to seek an additional $12 million for the third round. In all, the County could qualify for a total of $117 million through the end of 2024.
The County has put the previous allocations toward six developments that are underway around the region. The 172 funded No Place Like Home units will be integrated among 687 total affordable housing units.
The first 24 apartments will be ready for occupancy in March. By January 2023, 172 NPLH units will become available with a total 687 affordable housing units.
The County anticipates receiving the third round of funds this spring.

425,County Plans to Offer COVID-19 Vaccine to People 65 Years and Older,"Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced that people 65 years of age and older are the next priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, and the County is planning to make the vaccine available to them as soon as possible.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-plans-to-offer-covid-19-vaccine-to-people-65-years-and-older/,2021-01-13T17:40:07-08:00,"
Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced that people 65 years of age and older are the next priority group for COVID-19 vaccination, and the County is planning to make the vaccine available to them as soon as possible.
The region is currently vaccinating the 620,000 health care professionals and other priority groups in Phase 1A. Vaccinations to the more than 600,000 people in Phase 1B will begin to be available later this month, provided there are COVID-19 vaccination doses available.
However, some San Diegans in this age group might be able to get vaccinated if their health care providers have doses available. The County has asked local providers to give priority to people 65 and older with underlying medical conditions.
“It would be ideal if we could vaccinate everyone who wants to be immunized at the moment, but unfortunately we don’t have enough COVID-19 vaccine to do so,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We understand people are anxious to get vaccinated and they will get to do it when more vaccine arrives in the region.”
When County sites begin vaccinating San Diegans 65 years and older, the public will be informed in a number of ways, including on coronavirus-sd.com.
The region is expecting the arrival of more COVID-19 vaccine doses, but a figure and a date have not been released by the California Department of Public Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Starting in February, the County will begin to open three more vaccination super stations in other parts of the region.

To date, about 242,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses have been shipped to the region – an amount that does not include doses shipped to vaccinate people in long-term care facilities, multi-county entities and military and veterans’ hospitals.
Through Jan. 12, a total of 92,305 COVID-19 doses have been administered to San Diegans; 79,607 to people who have received their first dose and 12,698 to people who have received both doses of the vaccine. The totals only include vaccine doses that have been recorded in the San Diego Immunization Registry and it is likely the number of those vaccinated is higher. The California Department of Public Health has asked vaccine providers to enter vaccinations administered into the registry within 24 hours.
COVID-19 Cases Surpass 200,000 as Deaths Near 2,000 
The number of COVID-19 cases reported in the region has surpassed more than 200,000 infections.
An additional 3,261 were reported Jan. 12 and the region’s total is now 201,580.
Furthermore, an additional 54 COVID-19 deaths were reported in San Diego County for a total of 1,952, one of the highest daily totals recorded since the pandemic began.
“The high number of cases and deaths we are seeing shows that the virus is everywhere,” Wooten said. “People should be taking every precaution necessary, including getting vaccinated if they’re in a priority group that is currently being immunized.”
Wooten continues to urge San Diegans to do the following:

Wash your hands
Watch your distance around others
Wear a mask
When sick, stay home and get tested

428,VIDEO: Houdini the Husky’s Final Disappearing Act – A Forever Home!,"Ladies and gentlemen, Houdini the Husky has performed his best trick yet with the help of a professional magician. The dog who needed a home after being adopted and returned seven times has vanished from the San Diego County Animal Shelter and is now in the loving and capable hands of his new best friend, a Las Vegas headlining magician.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/houdini-the-huskys-final-disappearing-act-a-forever-home/,2021-01-14T15:36:21-08:00,"
Ladies and gentlemen, Houdini the Husky has performed his best trick yet with the help of a professional magician. The dog who needed a home after being adopted and returned seven times has vanished from the San Diego County Animal Shelter and is now in the loving and capable hands of his new best friend, a Las Vegas headlining magician.
Animal Services staff sorted through more than a hundred interested applicants for Houdini, a 3-year-old Husky who earned his name for being an escape artist at some of his previous adopter homes, before making a magical decision.
“I am happy that we have found an adopter for Houdini. We talked at length about the seven adoption returns and what Houdini would need to prevent any further such things from happening. He was incredibly understanding, and I feel that he is willing to put in the work required and has researched what will be needed,” said Donald Davis, supervising animal care attendant for the shelter.
New owner, Steve Wyrick, is thrilled to find a new best friend. He said he had been looking at animal shelters to find a dog but had not yet settled on one. Then he came upon an article online about Houdini, and it just clicked with him.
“We sometimes forget that our imperfections are the very things that make us special,” said Wyrick. “In Houdini’s case, the seven different families that returned him to the shelter had various reasons why he wasn’t a perfect fit. Animal Services of San Diego shared with me a list of those reasons. What I discovered were the traits that made him challenging to some, in fact, made him so special to me.”
“Apparently, he likes to escape from things, and I’ve been escaping from handcuffs and hanging boxes for years. Maybe he can teach me a few new tricks!” he said.
While Wyrick is certainly a showman by nature and is up for having some fun with the fact that a magician was selected to adopt Houdini, he knows it will take patience and love. He doesn’t have any plans to put Houdini in his show, he is looking simply for a personal companion. Since there are no shows going on in Las Vegas during the pandemic, he plans to drive Houdini to his lakeside home in the Midwest. He has already hired a dog trainer to help him work out some of Houdini’s behavioral issues and has plans to run along the lake with him to keep him active.

He feels in his heart that he will be Houdini’s eighth and forever home.
“The number eight is associated with infinity and infinite love. Now he’s going to have a magical life,” Wyrick said.
“I hope this inspires everyone to visit their local shelter and consider adopting a best friend. There are some amazing animals that need to be rescued and given a second chance, and a third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and an eighth chance,” Wyrick said with a smile.
While Houdini has disappeared, people interested in adopting dogs or cats— or any of Animal Services other pets on their website — can complete an adoption application, available here, and submit it by email to DASInfo@sdcounty.ca.gov, or call Animal Services to set an appointment at (619) 767-2675.
Due to COVID-19 precautions, DAS is offering touchless adoptions. Animal Services staff will contact people in the order their application was received and conduct the adoption process over the phone.

434,Record-High COVID-19 Deaths Reported in San Diego County,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a record-high number of new COVID-19 deaths. The 65 deaths reported today surpass the previous single-day record of 62 deaths reported on New Year’s Eve.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/record-high-covid-19-deaths-reported-in-san-diego-county/,2021-01-20T18:27:04-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a record-high number of new COVID-19 deaths. The 65 deaths reported today surpass the previous single-day record of 62 deaths reported on New Year’s Eve.
Health officials are attributing the spike in deaths to holiday gatherings.
“The majority of the COVID-19 deaths we are reporting today occurred in the past two weeks, which suggests that illness onset for the individuals who passed away coincided with the winter holidays, said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. County public health officer. “While we anticipated that deaths would go up at the beginning of the year, it is tragic to see the devastating impact of the virus on our community.”
Wooten is pleading with the community to take the record deaths as a reminder that the virus is not over and that we must do all we can to prevent the spread of COVID-19. County health officials urge San Diegans to:

Wash your hands
Wear a mask
Keep your distance from others and leave your household only for essential activities
If you’re sick, get tested, and then stay home and isolate yourself
Consider getting vaccinated once you are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.

A face familiar to many in election and media circles, Registrar of Voters Michael Vu is now taking on the responsibilities of Assistant Chief Administrative Officer for the County of San Diego.
Vu began his new role Jan. 8 after working for the County for nearly 14 years, the last eight as Registrar.
The Chief Administrative Office is responsible for implementing policy decisions from the Board of Supervisors. The office also manages day-to-day operations.
Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer praised Vu for working tirelessly to engage the San Diego community in a way that represents County values.
“Not only has he enjoyed taking on new challenges, but he has been innovative and resourceful in responding to them,” said Robbins-Meyer. “For this, he has gained the respect and trust of many within our community, including community-based organizations, advocacy groups, elected officials and the media.”
“I am eager to contribute in any way to the goals of the County and to work with the Chief Administrative Officer and the Board of Supervisors on the most pressing issues that the County faces.” said Vu. “Having dedicated myself to public service for 24 years in conducting elections, I am looking forward to bringing those experiences with me in this new role.”
As Vu takes on his new responsibilities, he will also continue to lead the Registrar of Voters particularly now that a special vacancy election is expected for the 79th Assembly District. Assistant Registrar Cynthia Paes will serve as the Acting Registrar.
Vu succeeds Tracy Sandoval as Assistant CAO. Sandoval left the County last October to become the Chief Executive Officer for the San Diego County Employees Retirement Association (SDCERA).

437,"Rains on the way, Get Sandbags from County, CAL FIRE","Rains, potentially heavy, are on the way this weekend and the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are offering free sandbags to residents who live in the unincorporated areas.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/204651-2/,2021-01-22T14:19:37-08:00,"
With potentially heavy rains expected around the county this weekend and early next week, the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are offering free sandbags to residents who live in the unincorporated areas.
Weather forecasters say we’re in for a dramatic shift in weather starting this weekend, with cold temperatures and potentially heavy rains expected in two separate storms.
As they have in the past, the County and CAL FIRE are providing free bags and/or sand at numerous fire stations for people who live in the unincorporated areas.
Rain can cause flooding and erosion, particularly in areas that aren’t covered by plants, landscaping, grass and trees. Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.
Sand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.
People should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags. Some stations may have a limited supply.

440,County Expands COVID-19 Vaccinations to 65 and Older,The County of San Diego today expanded the category of those eligible to include those aged 65 and up.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-expands-covid-19-vaccinations-to-65-and-older/,2021-01-23T15:49:02-08:00,"
The County of San Diego today expanded the category of those eligible to include those aged 65 and up.
“As I indicated a few weeks ago, the County anticipated expanding eligibility to individuals 65 years of age and older the week of January 25 as part of the continued focus on those at the greatest risk,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “With a number of health care providers now vaccinating in the age group, and the UC San Diego Health Super Station having a surplus of appointments, the decision was made this afternoon. Appointments are still required and vaccinations are available based on supply.”
More information is at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine and reservations can be made at vaccinationsuperstationsd.com
Only Health Care Workers (Phase 1A, All Tiers) and those 65 and older (Phase 1B, Tier 1) can visit vaccination sites.

Health care workers and those over 65 are encouraged to first contact their doctor or health care provider to request the vaccine, but if none are available, then they should make an appointment for a County site
Appointments are required; walk-ups and drive-ups without appointments will be turned away.
Do not schedule an appointment if you have COVID-19, or are sick. Please follow CDC guidance for those situations

441,"Restrictions Eased for Restaurants, Other Businesses","After seven weeks of closures, restaurants, museums, theaters and other businesses can resume outdoor operations immediately under state guidance.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/restrictions-eased-for-restaurants-other-businesses/,2021-01-25T17:20:22-08:00,"
After seven weeks of closures, restaurants, museums, theaters and other businesses can resume outdoor operations immediately under state guidance.
Hair salons, barbershops, nail salons and tattoo parlors can open indoors. Hotels and other lodging can open.
The changes are a result of California health officials’ announcement today that the Regional Stay Home Order has been lifted for all regions of the state.
The state’s four-week intensive care unit bed availability projection for the Southern California region, which includes San Diego County, is expected to be above 15%, the threshold that allows regions to exit the order.
“We urged San Diegans to stay at home and most heeded our message,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Their actions have helped to slow the spread of COVID-19, kept hospitals and health care workers from being completely overwhelmed and, most importantly, saved lives.”
The lifting of the Regional Stay Home Order means that San Diego County is now back in Tier 1, or the Purple Tier, and can return to the rules and framework of the Blueprint for a Safer Economy, the color-coded tiers that indicate which activities and businesses are open based on local case rates and test positivity percentage.
The County’s adjusted case rate is currently at 49.6 per every 100,000 residents, which is expected to be reflected on the state’s website tomorrow. The rate is well above the 7.0 case rate that is required to move into the less restrictive Tier 2, or Red Tier. Fifty-four of the 58 California counties are in the strictest level, or Purple Tier.
The region’s 7-day case positivity rate is 14.8%, also well above the 7% needed to move to the Red Tier.
Counties must remain in their current tier for three weeks and post case rates and testing positivity percentage in the higher tier for two weeks before moving into the less restrictive level.
Tier updates are provided weekly on Tuesdays; however, counties can choose to impose stricter rules.
Household gatherings are also now allowed, but they should be limited to no more than three households and the interactions must occur outdoors. People must also keep their distance and wear a mask. The 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew remains in effect.
“The pandemic is not over, people should continue taking the recommended precautions,” Wooten said.
County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to do the following:

When it’s your turn, get vaccinated
Wash your hands
Watch your distance around others
Wear a mask
When sick, stay home and get tested

442,Board Expands COVID-19 Rental Assistance Program,The County Board of Supervisors voted today to expand its emergency rental assistance program for San Diegans who have suffered economic hardships due to COVID-19.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-expands-covid-19-rental-assistance-program/,2021-01-26T19:11:34-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted today to expand the emergency rental assistance program for San Diegans who have suffered economic hardships due to COVID-19.
The County’s program allows San Diegans who are facing eviction or are unable to pay their rent to apply for financial assistance. Funds can be used to cover rent, utilities and other household expenses.
The expanded program will award funds for up to six months of expenses at a time and applicants can request additional funding if they still require monetary assistance after that time. The emergency rental assistance program would also give priority to single-parent households, many of which have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic’s impact on the economy.
The program is funded by $48.8 million in federal stimulus funds the County received earlier this month. The federal stimulus dollars will cover rental assistance needs for residents living in 16 cities in the County, as well as the unincorporated areas. The cities of San Diego and Chula Vista received their own funds from the federal government and will oversee their rental assistance programs separately.
The Board also voted to work with the state to develop a plan to allow a safe return to youth sports competitions.
Return to Purple Tier
After the state lifted its seven-week Regional Stay Home Order yesterday, restaurants, museums, theaters and other businesses are now allowed to resume outdoor operations. The state made the decision to end the Stay Home Order based on projections that show the Southern California four-week intensive care unit bed availability to be above the 15% threshold it had previously established.
While the end of the Stay Home Order is welcome news, County Health Officials urge San Diegans to keep their guard up.
“This is still a precarious period, and we urge all San Diegans to continue to follow all of the health precautions we have implemented since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Please wash your hands, watch your distance, and wear your mask, and when it is your turn to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, get vaccinated.”
The County is currently vaccinating people 65 and older, as well as health care workers in Phase 1A at its vaccination sites. Appointments are required, and vaccinations are available based on supply.

The County Health and Human Services Agency’s child health officer has been appointed to a state board that provides advice on issues impacting children whose parents have limited income and resources.
Dr. Kelly Motadel is one of 15 members on the Medi-Cal Children’s Health Advisory Panel, which advises the California Department of Health Care Services on policy and operational issues that affect children on Medi-Cal.
“I’m really looking forward to this experience as a way to contribute on a broader level but also in order to be a more knowledgeable resource for San Diego County,” said Motadel, M.D., M.P.H., who was recently selected to be the Child Health Officer at the County Medical Care Services Division. 
The 15 members on the advisory body are recognized experts and stakeholders in their fields, “practicing and/or certified medical professionals, advocates who represent the interest of children’s health, as well as parent members who provide feedback on topics that impact children in Medi-Cal.”
While the term is usually three years, Motadel’s appointment will last through Dec. 31, 2022 because she is completing the term of a recently departed member.
As the Child Health Officer at the County Medical Care Services Division, Motadel is responsible for assisting in the planning, organizing and directing of all functions related to children’s health in the County of San Diego, including the enforcement of all related laws, ordinances and regulations.
Motadel also provides consultation and medical direction to First 5 San Diego, Child Welfare Services and Public Health programs on children’s health topics and will serve as pediatric liaison to Behavioral Health Services – Children, Youth, and Families System of Care.
The Medical Care Services Division supports access to quality, timely and evidence-based care in San Diego County’s communities, a goal of Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision to improve the health, safety and well-being of area residents.
“The County has been aggressively working to improve the health, safety and well-being of San Diego County children and residents in the region, and Dr. Motadel will advocate on our region’s behalf on this state advisory panel,” said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency.

445,"County Campaign Aims to Save Black Babies, Mothers",Black infants in San Diego County are three times more likely to die at birth and 60% more likely to be premature than white infants.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-campaign-aims-to-save-black-babies-mothers/,2021-01-28T16:35:47-08:00,"
Black infants in San Diego County are three times more likely to die at birth and 60% more likely to be premature than white infants.
To continue to drive these numbers down, the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) today launched Black Legacy Now, an education and outreach campaign to improve health outcomes for Black babies and their mothers in the region.
The new campaign supports the County’s Perinatal Equity Initiative, which is being funded with a $1.45 million grant from the California Department of Public Health to reduce racial bias to improve birth and maternal health outcomes for Black families. The initiative’s goals are to:

Address the causes of persistent inequality and identify best practices
Promote the use of specific interventions designed to fill gaps in current programming
Provide funding to County health departments to promote leadership and coordination for widespread and lasting change in public awareness

Black mothers in California are more than three times more likely to die due to pregnancy and delivery complications than white mothers, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These health outcome disparities persist regardless of factors, such as the mother’s income or education.
“These disparities are unjust, inexcusable and cannot be allowed to persist,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. “Racism is a significant threat to the health and vitality of our community and none of us can stand idly by while babies and mothers continue to die.”
Black Legacy Now aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities. The campaign is bringing together San Diego County’s top health care, government, public policy and maternal and infant health experts to address these disparities and create concrete plans for reducing systemic bias and improving health outcomes for Black families in San Diego County.
“While it is often said, ‘it takes a village to raise a child’, it will take each and every one of us to stand up to long-standing inequities,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The first step is education, followed by community-wide action. This launch is the first step in what will be a long-term campaign focused on driving real, measurable change for Black families in San Diego County.”
Dr. Kelly Elmore, Perinatal Equity Initiative Community Advisory Board member and board-certified OB/GYN, outlined potential changes for local health care systems including:

Standardization of maternal and infant care protocols for physicians and patient education
An increase in remote patient monitoring for new parent support
Incorporating mental health counseling into routine post-partum care
Updates to patient discharge instructions to provide new mothers with simple instructions and tips for knowing when to seek medical help
Increased access to alternative birthing centers and midwifery


HHSA already funds the San Diego County Black Infant Health Program, which offers social support, stress management and empowerment through prenatal/postpartum groups and one-on-one sessions— to help women to understand their risks and try to reduce them. Additionally, PEI supports a Fatherhood Initiative for soon-to-be fathers and fathers with an infant up to 1 year of age and whose partner is Black, as well as implicit bias training for medical providers to improve services for Black pregnant and parenting women.

446,County Launches New Vaccination Appointment Map,"To make it easier for San Diegans to make an appointment to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, the County today launched a new interactive map showing all the vaccination sites.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-launches-new-vaccination-appointment-map/,2021-01-28T17:25:42-08:00,"
To make it easier for San Diegans to make an appointment to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus, the County today launched a new interactive map showing all the vaccination sites.
People in Phase 1A and 65 years and older can now make appointments through the new English and Spanish site, which, when fully developed, will be very similar to the one used to find testing sites.
The new map allows users to pick a location and connects them to the appointment system for that site. You can access the map from a link on  www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.
“We’re trying to make it easier for people to make an appointment and get vaccinated when it’s their turn,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccine is safe and effective and it’s the best tool we have to slow the pandemic.”
County to Open Vaccination Clinic in San Marcos
Starting Jan. 31, a new COVID-19 vaccination super station will be up and running on the California State University San Marcos campus.
The new pedestrian site will be vaccinating people, with appointments, from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday at the Sports Center and Clarke Field House, located at 333 South Twin Oaks Valley Road in San Marcos.  Free parking will be available in Parking Structure 1 on levels 2 and 3 and disabled parking in Lot L next to the Sports Center,
The County-run site is a collaboration between the County and CSU San Marcos, with staff support from Palomar Health, UC San Diego Health and Tri-City Medical Center. It will offer about 1,000 doses daily depending on vaccine availability but can ramp up to vaccinate 5,000 people daily when more vaccine is available. Appointments are required and can be scheduled at www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. Appointments for this site will become available Saturday afternoon.
In Borrego Springs this weekend, a CAL FIRE team as part of “Operation Collaboration” will provide 250 COVID-19 doses both Saturday and Sunday. Appointments are necessary.
Operation Collaboration is a consortium of local fire agencies using County vaccine. CAL FIRE and other groups will also be going to other communities soon, especially to vaccinate people in nursing and long-term care homes.
All County clinics are vaccinating people in Phase 1A and people 65 years and older in Phase 1B and require appointments, which can be made at vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. People 75 and older who don’t have access to a computer or Internet can call 2-1-1 for assistance in scheduling an appointment.
San Diegans without transportation can use the Metropolitan Transit System to travel to a vaccination site for free by showing proof of their appointment.
Vaccination appointments fill up quickly, so County health officials are urging San Diegans to wait their turn and get vaccinated when more doses become available.
“Be patient. Your turn will come,” Wooten said.
An older man gets vaccinated against COVID-19 at the vaccination super station in Chula Vista.
The County plans to open two more vaccination super stations in East and North County in February.
Some doctors, pharmacists and other health care providers may administer vaccinations to those 65 and older, if they have doses available.
Through Jan. 27, about 486,000 doses have been shipped to the region and more than 269,000 have been entered into the immunization data base as having been administered. More information on vaccine distribution can be found on the County vaccination dashboard.

San Diegans who qualify and want to get vaccinated against the novel coronavirus will have one more place to do it after the County opens a vaccination super station Feb. 2 in La Mesa and a smaller clinic in San Ysidro.
The La Mesa site, operated by Sharp HealthCare, will open at the Grossmont Center shopping mall, 5500 Grossmont Center Dr., Suite 212. Appointments are required.
The new walk-up clinic will be vaccinating people from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Friday. Up to 1,000 doses will be administered daily, but the site’s capacity can be expanded to provide up to 5,000 vaccinations every day.

450,"Season’s First Flu Death Reported, Also Had COVID-19","A 65-year-old man from East County is the first influenza death reported in San Diego County this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/seasons-first-flu-death-reported-also-had-covid-19/,2021-02-03T11:45:59-08:00,"
A 65-year-old man from East County is the first influenza death reported in San Diego County this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The man, who was also diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, died Jan. 13, had underlying medical conditions and had been vaccinated against influenza.
“Influenza deaths are very unfortunate, but they do occur every flu season,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While influenza activity has been very low this season, San Diegans should get vaccinated against the flu to prevent getting influenza and COVID-19 at the same time.”
Through Jan. 30, 2021, there have been 39 people diagnosed with influenza and COVID-19 at the same time.
To date, 677 influenza cases have been reported in the region, compared to 11,863 cases that had been registered at the same time last year. A total of 108 people died from influenza last season.
Your Best Shot Against the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Stay away from sick people
Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

The flu vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies. If you don’t have medical insurance, you can go to a County public health center to get vaccinated. For a list of locations, visit the County’s influenza Website or call 211 San Diego.

The number of San Diegans wanting to be vaccinated against the novel coronavirus significantly exceeds the total doses that have been shipped to the region to date.
That’s why County health officials are urging San Diegans to be patient and get vaccinated when it’s their turn.
The County has opened four vaccination super stations and operates 15 smaller community points of dispensing, or PODs. While combined they have the capacity to vaccinate 20,000 people daily, the County doesn’t have access to that many daily doses yet to be able vaccinate everyone who wants one.
“Due to the limited number of COVID-19 vaccine doses in the region, County community clinics are continuing to vaccinate only health care professionals and people 65 and older,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We’re asking San Diegans to be patient and to get vaccinated when more doses are available. Vaccination appointments are only available for the number of doses we have on hand or we know are coming.”
Doctors, pharmacies, community clinics and other health care providers are also working to provide vaccinations to San Diegans in the priority groups.
COVID-19 Vaccines Also Available in Rural Areas
To make the COVID-19 vaccine available to more people who qualify, local paramedics and emergency medical technicians are administering vaccinations in rural communities.
These rotating vaccination clinics are part of Operation Collaboration, an effort involving about two dozen fire and emergency services agencies including CAL FIRE and San Diego County Fire Protection District. Fire agencies are also helping to vaccinate people in long-term care facilities.
The clinics, which started this week, will take place in rural communities such as Ramona, Julian and Jamul.
All County vaccination super stations and PODs require appointments and can be made at vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.
A COVID-19 vaccination is administered at the Grossmont Center Vaccination Super Station.
People 75 and over and who do not have access to a computer or someone to assist them may dial 2-1-1 for appointment assistance.
Also, County-funded community health workers, known as promotoras, will be reaching out to people 75 and older directly to help them make vaccination appointments.
The Metropolitan Transit System is offering free rides to people with proof of a vaccination appointment.
To date, more than 586,000 COVID-19 doses have been delivered to the region. Of those, more than 357,000 have been administered, including more than 58,000 San Diegans who have received two doses and 10.2 percent of the population over age 16 who have received at least one dose. More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County’s vaccination dashboard.

453,"Vaccination Numbers Grow, But Keep Up Mask Wearing, Social Distancing","As an increasing number of San Diegans get vaccinated against COVID-19, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reminding the community that it is too soon to stop the use of face coverings and social distancing.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/vaccination-numbers-grow-but-keep-up-mask-wearing-social-distancing/,2021-02-05T10:50:54-08:00,"
As an increasing number of San Diegans get vaccinated against COVID-19, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reminding the community that it is too soon to stop the use of face coverings and social distancing. These measures will be necessary for the foreseeable future to slow the spread of the virus.
While the two FDA-authorized vaccines have shown promising results in clinical trials, it takes several weeks for the immunizations to become fully effective. In addition, it is yet unknown whether a vaccinated person could potentially catch and spread COVID-19 to someone who has not been vaccinated.
“Even if some of your older relatives and friends have received their vaccination, we urge you to postpone visits with them until later this year when you are fully vaccinated and protected as well,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective, but we can only end this pandemic once herd immunity is achieved.”
Herd immunity refers to the stage in the pandemic when a majority of the population is immune to the virus, either because a person received the vaccine, or because they developed antibodies after a COVID-19 infection. Public health officials say we will need to vaccinate up to 80% of the U.S. population to achieve herd immunity.
So far, a little more than 10% of San Diegans age 16 and over have received at least one of the two shots required to develop antibody protection against the virus.
Until a majority of the region is fully protected, San Diegans should limit their interactions with people outside of their households. While small gatherings are currently allowed, they should be limited to no more than three households and the interactions must occur outdoors. People must also keep their distance and wear a face covering.
“Ending this pandemic will require us to take advantage of all the tools available to us,” Wooten said. “For now, we need to be a little bit more patient and continue masking and social distancing, as well as getting a vaccination, so we can get back to normal as soon as possible.”

457,“Love Your Heart” Aims to Reduce Risk of Severe COVID-19 Illness,"Today, County leaders, regional officials and community partners had a virtual news conference to encourage people to get a blood pressure screening to make sure they are not suffering from hypertension often referred to as the “silent killer.”",https://www.countynewscenter.com/love-your-heart-aims-to-reduce-risk-of-severe-covid-19-illness/,2021-02-08T14:35:21-08:00,"
Ninety-five percent of all San Diegans who have died from the novel coronavirus had underlying medical conditions and hypertension or high blood pressure was the primary condition.
That’s why today, County leaders, regional officials and community partners had a virtual news conference to encourage people to get a blood pressure screening to make sure they are not suffering from hypertension often referred to as the “silent killer.”
“This small step of knowing your numbers and the commitment to it has the potential to be a life-saving exercise,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. “In the last year, we’ve seen that people who contract COVID who have an underlying health condition are most at risk.”
Ten years ago, the County launched the “Love Your Heart” campaign, an annual public health event that offers people an opportunity to get their blood pressure checked at hundreds of locations in San Diego and Mexico.
This year, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the number of sites offering blood pressure screenings will be limited but the campaign will last an entire week, from Feb. 8 through Feb. 14. While some local businesses will have blood pressure screenings on site, San Diegans are encouraged to only get their blood pressure checked if they are out conducting essential activities.
Also, and thanks to The San Diego Foundation, 6,000 low-income families in the region will receive blood pressure cuffs to monitor their blood pressure numbers.
“We are proud to bring funders together to support the ‘Love Your Heart’ campaign, especially at a moment when health disparities have never been more apparent,” said Mark Stuart, president and chief executive officer of The San Diego Foundation. “This announcement is part of a long-term effort to improve the quality of life for all San Diegans and to chip away at the health inequalities that have existed here in San Diego County for generations.”
High blood pressure is known as the “silent killer” because it may show no symptoms. However, hypertension puts people at an increased risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the top causes of death in the region. Fifty-nine percent of San Diegans have hypertension.
“It’s important that you know your numbers and to make your heart health a priority,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Being proactive can save your life and help protect you from the worst COVID-19 outcomes if you do become infected, including an extended hospitalization in the intensive care unit.”
Last year, more than 56,000 people got their blood pressure checked at Love Your Heart sites in the United States and Mexico, which joined the campaign in 2015.
A woman gets her blood pressure checked at the Mexican Consulate in Little Italy.
Love Your Heart aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
San Diegans who participate in Love Your Heart are encouraged to submit their results and participate in online educational workshops throughout February. People can submit their results during the entire month of February to learn what they mean and receive a free face mask and hand sanitizer while supplies last.

458,San Diego County Child Support Services Recognized by DHHS for Outreach Efforts,The San Diego County Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) was recently recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for its outreach efforts in 2020 to be inclusive to all members of the diverse San Diego community.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-county-child-support-services-recognized-by-dhhs-for-outreach-efforts/,2021-02-08T16:20:33-08:00,"
The San Diego County Department of Child Support Services (DCSS) was recently recognized by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for its outreach efforts in 2020 to be inclusive to all members of the diverse San Diego community.
Federal officials recognized the child Support department by highlighting their email flyer outreach program in the December/January edition of Child Support Report, the official publication of the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement.
DCSS is using a new way to communicate directly with parents who receive Child Support services and also identify Spanish as their primary language to improve engagement and access to child support information.
Jennifer Hellerud, Deputy Director of DCSS, said the office created outreach materials in both English and Spanish to highlight events, general information, and specific services and delivered the information using Peachjar, a company that specializes in sending digital flyers to the parents of K-12 students. The department cross-referenced geographic, economic, and populations statistics to identify key areas where the flyers would most likely be able to reach their target audience.
“This was the first time our office used mass communication tools for outreach beyond existing case participants, and we carefully tailored the language and imagery in each flyer to address the needs of that community in the context of the child support program, said Eaton”
During the first three months, DCSS sent flyers to nearly 200 schools resulting in a total of 330,987 emails. And 34% of the emails were opened, which is much higher than the 21% industry standard for government emails.
“This impressive open rate may be because emails from schools are more familiar and trusted by parents,” said Eaton.
Jeff Grissom, Director of San Diego County DCSS, said the flyers and outreach materials that received the most clicks were ones that included a list of services in easily understood terminology on programs and services that matter most to our community.
“Our website, which is available in both Spanish and English, also received a 22% increase in Spanish-speaking visitors over the previous year,” said Grissom. “And we experienced modest but noteworthy growth of Spanish-speaking new case openings and engagement.”
Grissom said the office plans on continuing to use Peachjar to complement its website and Facebook and Twitter presence.

459,Gov. Newsom Tours Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park,Gov. Gavin Newsom was in San Diego today to tour the County’s COVID-19 Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/gov-newsom-tours-vaccination-super-station-at-petco-park/,2021-02-08T18:16:44-08:00,"
Gov. Gavin Newsom was in San Diego today to tour the County’s COVID-19 Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park. The site was the first of its kind in the state and the governor lauded the County and its partners for their efforts in vaccinating more than 100,000 San Diegans at the site since it opened last month.
The governor said the Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park helped inspire jurisdictions across the state to initiate similar large-scale vaccination efforts.
Locally, the County has added three additional Vaccination Super Stations and more than a dozen vaccine PODS since Petco Park became operational as a vaccination site. Together, medical professionals at these sites have administered about a half million COVID-19 vaccines to San Diegans eligible to be vaccinated.
The operation in the Tailgate Lot at Petco Park is the result of a partnership between the County, UC San Diego Health, the San Diego Padres and the City of San Diego which owns the property. Speakers from all entities attended a press conference this morning to join the governor in talking about the region’s vaccination efforts.
Speakers included Gov. Newsom, County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher; San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria; Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.; County public health officer; and Erik Greupner, Chief Executive Officer, San Diego Padres. Highlights from this morning’s remarks are included in the above video.
State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 42.5 cases per 100,000 residents and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.

460,County to Seek Housing Funds for Foster Youth,"The Board of Supervisors today voted to let the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) apply for $480,000 for housing services for foster youth.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-seek-housing-funds-for-foster-youth/,2021-02-09T14:43:12-08:00,"
The Board of Supervisors today voted to let the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) apply for $480,000 for housing services for foster youth.
The funds would be used by HHSA’s Child Welfare Services to provide additional housing assistance to reduce youth homelessness in the region.
HHSA’s Transitional Housing Program provides up to three years of subsidized housing for current and former foster youth between 18 and 24 years of age.
During fiscal year 2019-20, a total of 495 youth received subsidized housing and 93% of them were able to maintain stable housing over the course of that fiscal year.
Given the high rate of stability in the program, more than 300 youth receive assistance in any given month.
The additional funds will expand housing resources to more than 100 youth currently in foster care, as well as youth at higher risk of unstable housing or homelessness, including:

Youth who are pregnant and/or parenting
Youth with mental and behavioral health needs
Youth with substance use disorders

The housing assistance that HHSA provides to youth leaving foster care supports the County’s Live Well San Diego vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents by furthering efforts to improve outcomes for youth entering adulthood to help them maintain a stable home and prevent homelessness.
Today’s action also directs HHSA to look for and to apply for any additional funds to support transitional housing for youth.

461,"Board Votes to Expand Rental Assistance, Small Business Grant Programs",The County Board of Supervisors today decided on how the County will distribute pending emergency rental assistance funds allocated to the region by the state.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-expands-rental-assistance-small-business-grant-programs/,2021-02-09T18:21:11-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today decided on how the County will distribute pending emergency rental assistance funds allocated to the region by the state.
The County will administer a single program, overseeing the distribution of an estimated $52.5 million in state funding and the $49 million in funding from the federal government the County received in January. These funds will assist San Diegans who have been economically impacted by COVID-19 in paying for housing expenses.
The program will serve people who reside in the unincorporated areas of the County, as well as San Diegans living in 16 cities within the region. The cities of San Diego and Chula Vista received funding directly from the federal and state governments and will not be covered under the County’s program.
The emergency rental assistance program is open to both County residents who have applied to previous emergency rental assistance programs, and those who have not received rental assistance through the initiative. The County will soon open the application period for the program and area residents who want to learn more about the initiative and how to apply for COVID-19 rental assistance, can find more information here.
Small Business Grants
The Board also voted to provide additional stimulus funds to small businesses that have suffered economic hardship due to the pandemic. The Board voted to allocate at least $30 million to the Small Business Stimulus Grant Program once the federal and state government appropriate funds to the County in the coming weeks.
Today’s Board action allows County staff to prepare the next round of the program so grants can be distributed to qualified applicants as soon as the funds come in. Depending on the timing of federal government approval, the Board may call a special meeting to finalize the details of the next round of the program once the County receives the funds.
The upcoming round will be open to small businesses and nonprofit entities with 20 or fewer employees. As with prior grants, Board offices will determine final eligibility for businesses in their respective jurisdictions.

463,County Fire Plays Key Role in COVID Vaccine Rollout,"San Diego County Fire Protection District personnel have played a key role in helping to vaccinate more than 9,000 county residents against COVID-19 over the past month as part of “Operation Collaboration.”",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-fire-plays-key-role-in-covid-vaccine-rollout/,2021-02-11T09:32:49-08:00,"
San Diego County Fire Protection District personnel have played a key role in helping to vaccinate more than 10,000 county residents against COVID-19 over the past month as part of “Operation Collaboration.”
Officially launched Dec. 29, Operation Collaboration is a combined effort between dozens of fire, emergency medical service, public health agencies and hundreds of personnel in the San Diego area to meet the COVID vaccination needs of some of the county’s most vulnerable residents.
“Operation Collaboration is an important resource as we ensure vaccines are provided equitably to people throughout our entire County,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Just as they did during COVID-19 testing, the first responder community is again demonstrating its creativity and commitment to public health.”
According to San Diego County Fire Chief Tony Mecham, the operation consists of two phases. The first phase involved getting the first responders who would administer the vaccines vaccinated themselves, and the second phase was to set up point of dispensing (POD) locations to administer the vaccine to those currently eligible.
“We began the operation with the vaccination of EMTs and paramedics in the county, as part of San Diego County’s Phase 1A Tier 1, then had the opportunity to expand that effort into long-term care facilities, and now into our rural communities,” said Mecham. “To play a role in vaccinating some of our most vulnerable populations is incredibly rewarding. Our personnel have been working non-stop and seeing the value of their efforts with every dose makes it all worthwhile.”
Mecham said it’s not uncommon for County Fire to work alongside other partner agencies, but what makes this event different is the overall size of the operation.
“To be side-by-side with over 25 departments and multiple EMS agencies working to support the vaccination process is incredible,” said Mecham. “With these partnerships, we’re able to reach large portions of the community regardless of where they live. In the past week, we’ve had vaccination events in locations across the county from Borrego Springs to El Cajon and Carlsbad.”
According to Kenny Wheaton, a fire captain/paramedic with the Warner Spring Fire Station, the rural communities served by Operation Collaboration have been extremely grateful for the outreach efforts.
“We serve in these areas every day, so there are plenty of familiar faces at these events,” said Wheaton. “To have the opportunity to provide vaccinations in these communities is an honor and has been a positive experience for everyone.”
Wheaton also said the effort has had its fair share of logistical challenges in planning and delivering the vaccine to rural communities and long-term care facilities.
“These vaccines save lives and are the quickest way to get our communities back to some sense of normalcy,” said Wheaton. “The rural vaccination sites have been very successful thus far; lines and wait times are minimal and we work hard to get residents in and out in a timely manner.”
County residents in rural locations who meet the vaccine criteria and are interested in making an appointment to receive the vaccine at either the fixed PODs or temporary sites are encouraged to check the County Fire Facebook page and County Fire Twitter for the most up-to-date locations on where the vaccine will be administered. All County and County partner sites, as well as information on groups eligible to receive vaccines, can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

464,VIDEO: Wastewater Monitoring Piloted as Path to Safe School Reopening,The County of San Diego is working with the University of California San Diego on a pilot program that may provide a roadmap for schools to safely reopen while our community gets vaccinated.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/wastewater-monitoring-piloted-as-path-to-safe-school-reopening/,2021-02-11T10:50:29-08:00,"
The County of San Diego is working with the University of California San Diego on a pilot program that may provide a roadmap for schools to safely reopen while our community gets vaccinated.
The Safer at School Early Alert system, or “Sassy” as it is called by participants, is an evidence-based program to detect SARS-CoV-2 at schools and child care centers. The project began with technology launched as part of UC San Diego’s Return to Learn program which collects daily wastewater samples that are tested for shed coronavirus.
For the last four months, Safer at School Early Alert has been piloted in 10 schools and two child care centers within communities at highest risk for COVID-19 including San Ysidro, Chula Vista, El Cajon, Southeastern San Diego and Vista.
“We know that through the pandemic, the educational gap has grown wider – often in our communities hardest hit by the pandemic,” said County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher. “In my discussions with UCSD researchers and my COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group, it became clear that there were lower-cost alternatives to regular testing that would allow for some of those most impacted students to return to school safely. Through this pilot and funding through the federal CARES Act appropriated by the Board, we have been able to test out new testing options. It is my hope that we could scale up this program.”
Through daily wastewater and surface monitoring, the Safer at School Early Alert tests for the presence of particles of the coronavirus and is combined with a responsive testing strategy. The goal is to quickly identify children or staff members who are infected with COVID-19 before an outbreak occurs.
The three elements of the pilot are using a robot in a sewage outlet to collect daily wastewater samples that are tested at UC San Diego School of Medicine, daily swabbing of floors for virus particles that have settled and a no-cost PCR testing program. Child care sites also send used diapers to test fecal samples in children who are not yet potty-trained.
A second step includes daily surface monitoring. Teachers or staff use a swab to sample a one-square-foot section of the center of the floor in a classroom, which is where aerosols tend to settle. These samples are tested daily at UC San Diego lab.
Testing children and staff at each location is the third part of the detection program. Children and staff who voluntarily consent undergo free PCR COVID-19 testing at their school or child care center in response to a positive result from wastewater or surface monitoring.
“The safe reopening of schools remains a priority for the County of San Diego,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “What UC San Diego has demonstrated with the Safer at School Early Alert pilot program models the types of steps that can help us ease back into classroom education while continuing to fight the virus.”

466,Success Story: County Man Finds Direction with RESPECT,"Five years ago, San Marcos resident Antonio Ramirez says, he was a teenager who was struggling with school, authority, peer pressure, gang influences, and the tragic death of a friend; luckily, he found his direction in life with help from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department and a little RESPECT.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/success-story-county-man-finds-direction-with-respect/,2021-02-12T12:19:44-08:00,"
Five years ago, San Marcos resident Antonio Ramirez says he was a teenager who was struggling with school, authority, peer pressure, gang influences, and the tragic death of a friend; luckily, he found his direction in life with help from the San Diego Sheriff’s Department and a little RESPECT.
Sponsored by the Sheriff’s Department, the RESPECT Project is a 10-week character-building and mentoring program for teenagers in the North County aimed at reducing juvenile delinquency, lowering recidivism, and offering alternatives to street gangs, substance abuse and a life trapped in the criminal justice system.
Today, just four years after his initial involvement in the RESPECT Project, the future is looking very bright for Ramirez, who is a new father and works full time as a traffic control specialist for San Diego Gas & Electric.
“The RESPECT Project is not like a school, they aren’t here to be your boss, they are here to be your mentors,” said Ramirez. “They are here to help out the community and they are going to teach you so many things. They show you other options and mentor you to make better decisions.”
Ramirez said some of the most valuable things he learned from the program were responsibility and communication, and how being able to communicate with others helps to open the door to opportunities you wouldn’t otherwise have. He also said the program changed his entire perspective about law enforcement.
“I learned responsibility, and how to go out and talk to people, and those people had certain connections, and that led to getting more mentors,” said Ramirez. “No matter what you do, the deputies will help guide you to the right place.”
At the time he was an active participant in the RESPECT Project, Ramirez said the program was run out of the San Marcos Boys and Girls Club, which presented some logistical challenges as limited space also limited the types of services provided. He said there was always hope the program would eventually get a new home, and it most certainly did.
The collaborative success of the RESPECT Project in North County led to the program getting its own 7,000-square-foot building in 2020. Located at 151 East Carmel Street in San Marcos, the one-story building features an activity area, recording studio, kitchen, classrooms conference room for guest speakers and an outdoor gym.
“Our ribbon-cutting ceremony was scheduled for December but was postponed indefinitely due to the pandemic,” said Deputy Dustin Nelson, who has been assigned full time to the RESPECT Project since December 2016. “We hope to serve between 10 to 30 students a day at our new campus and graduate an additional 30 to 45 students each year.”
Nelson, along with Deputy Todd Baker, are the founders and coordinators of the RESPECT Project that started back in 2014. Since that time, the program has grown to include additional deputies and volunteers from other county departments who help to mentor youth, serve as guest speakers and oversee field trips for both indoor and outdoor activities.
“When we started this program, we felt compelled to help solve problems in our community; we saw a lot of ‘band-aids’ being placed on juvenile delinquency and crime issues and we seized the opportunity to do more,” said Nelson.  “Todd and I believe in the importance of community service because it forces us to think outside of ourselves and take notice of others and their needs.”
Ramirez said the opening of the new RESPECT Project campus is important so that other struggling teenagers can benefit from the program in the same manner he did.
“They opened up a whole new world for me,” said Ramirez. “I appreciate those guys a lot and this new facility is going to help a lot of people just like me.”
Nelson said a total of 125 students have graduated from the program since it began in 2014, and that he also looks forward to when the new campus can be open for business.
“These students need that relationship, they need activities,” said Nelson. “We want to get back to doing what we do which is giving these students the tools and helping them solve their issues. There is something here for everyone.”
More information on the RESPECT Project is available on the Sheriff Department’s official website.

469,All Aboard: APCD Helps Coaster Train Riders Improve Air Quality,"Thanks to a helping hand from the County’s Air Pollution Control District, train riders on the North County Transit District’s Coaster line are doing more to keep climate-changing, polluting greenhouse gases out of our air.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/all-aboard-apcd-helps-coaster-train-riders-improve-air-quality/,2021-02-17T10:53:35-08:00,"
Thanks in part to a helping hand from the County’s Air Pollution Control District, train riders on the North County Transit District’s Coaster line are doing more to keep climate-changing, polluting greenhouse gases out of our air.
Last week, NCTD, federal and local officials including County Board of Supervisors Chairman Nathan Fletcher introduced five new, cleaner-running, Coaster replacement locomotives paid for by a $10 million grant from the Air Pollution Control District and $46 million in state funding.
NCTD officials who introduced the new locomotives along with several renovated Coaster passenger cars said they would increase service reliability, improve riders’ experience and be more environmentally friendly.
Air Pollution Control District officials estimate the replacement locomotives will improve air quality each year by preventing the emission of 144 collective tons of greenhouse gases and pollution into local skies.
That will include 124.3 tons of nitrogen engine emissions (NOx) that react in the atmosphere to create ozone, 12.58 tons of reactive organic gases (ROG) that also affect ozone production, and 6.92 tons of diesel particulate matter (PM) — small particles of carbon-like soot. The Environmental Protection Agency says that in addition to polluting the air, greenhouse gases trap heat, make the planet warmer and contribute to climate change.
The Air Pollution Control District’s contribution came from Carl Moyer grants, a program the state created in 1998 to help reduce pollution and toxic emissions.
The grants, which have become part of the County’s Clean Air for All campaign, are used to reimburse selected businesses, local governments, schools and utilities for swapping out high-polluting, heavy-duty equipment for low-polluting or zero-polluting vehicles, boats, transportation and machinery.
In August, the Air Pollution Control District selected projects from 49 organizations to be eligible to receive $21.3 in grants funded by California’s Air Resources Board and Department of Motor Vehicles that would eliminate 692 tons of greenhouse gas and pollution out of local skies.
Organizations must sign contracts to start their projects and are reimbursed once their projects are completed.

470,County Reserves COVID-19 Vaccine Appointments for Project SAVE,The County is reserving a portion of available COVID-19 vaccination appointments each day for a pilot project that aims to equitably distribute the novel coronavirus vaccine.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reserves-covid-19-vaccine-appointments-for-project-save/,2021-02-17T17:17:17-08:00,"
The County is reserving a portion of available COVID-19 vaccination appointments each day for a pilot project that aims to equitably distribute the novel coronavirus vaccine.
Project SAVE (Scheduling Assistance for Vaccine Equity) sets aside appointments for people who are in the currently eligible groups and at high risk for complications from COVID-19.
“We need to make sure that communities that have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 have easier access to the vaccine,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This project is making it easier for people who qualify to make appointments and get vaccinated.”
The pilot program is now operating in the southern region of the county and is managed by nine community groups who have access to reserve appointments at four vaccination sites. The sites are:

South Region Live Well Center – Chula Vista
Martin Luther King Community Center – National City
Mar Vista High School – Imperial Beach
Southwestern College – San Ysidro

The reserved appointments will be filled through outreach by community health workers or promotoras who are contacting people 65 and older at locations that include grocery stores, faith centers, food distribution sites and housing complexes in the South Bay.
Rescheduled Appointments
Due to delays in vaccine shipments to San Diego, the County is rescheduling approximately 1,000 first-dose appointments at its sites on Thursday and Friday. Those affected are being notified they will be rescheduled for next week.
Additional Vaccine Information
The Metropolitan Transit System is offering free rides to people with proof of a vaccination appointment and 2-1-1 San Diego and promotoras also have the capacity to arrange for transportation.

Recognizing that the COVID-19 pandemic would prove to challenge the San Diego emergency response community in an unprecedented way, local producer Dave Meyer set about documenting individual experiences.
Along with his co-collaborator and wife, Karen, Meyer began filming in spring 2020, chronicling in highly personal interviews, the toll, responsibilities, and hopes of a wide variety of first responders. 
“These people wanted to help their community, they had become part of small and large teams all focused on that goal,” Meyer says. “They’d say, ‘please tell people what I am doing and what we’re seeing every day.’” 
While the project remains ongoing, to date 19 individual interview vignettes have aired on KPBS, and the full-length documentary is now being shown on County News Center TV. Individual interviews and the full-length Essential Voices documentary can be viewed at davemeyerdesign.com/covid-19/.
County first responders interviewed in the Dave Meyer Design production include Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, Health and Human Services Agency Director Nick Macchione, Integrative Services Director Omar Passons, Chief Nursing Officer Denise Foster and Community Development Liaison Elizabeth Bustos.
Essential Voices is running at 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Friday through April 30 on County News Center TV, which can be found on Cox Communications Channel 24 in the south county, 19 in the north, as well as Spectrum (Time Warner) 24 or 85.

475,Medical Examiner Adds New Tech to 1981 Cold Case Effort,The San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office is putting current technology into a renewed effort to identify a man whose body was found nearly 40 years ago.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/medical-examiner-adds-new-tech-to-1981-cold-case-effort/,2021-02-19T15:06:13-08:00,"
The San Diego County Medical Examiner’s Office is putting current technology into a renewed effort to identify a man whose body was found nearly 40 years ago.
His remains were discovered in a burning Dumpster outside a Big Bear Market in the 9900 block of Mira Mesa Boulevard on Sept. 28, 1981. Despite efforts at the time, homicide investigators did not find any information to identify him.
The San Diego Police Cold Case Unit is now taking another look at this case. Police investigators worked with odontologists from the County Medical Examiner’s Office, who re-examined the man’s dental records taken during the initial autopsy. At the time, his age had been determined to be in his late teens, but with newer technology, dental experts now agree he was more likely in his mid 30s, give or take five years.
In a video produced by the San Diego Police Department, Detective Lori Adams of the Cold Case Unit said this new information expands the possibilities on identifying him and notifying his family. Determining his identity is also key to determining what happened to him and solving his case.
Police are reissuing a sketch of what the man may have looked like prior to his death. He is of undetermined race with a medium skin tone, with wavy auburn color hair and brown eyes. He was about 33 years old, give or take 5 years, stood approximately 5 foot 7 inches to 5 foot 10 inches in height, and weighed between 125 and 135 pounds. He had dental work which is consistent with being done in the United States.
In the video, Adams said that the passage of time can sometimes help in cold cases because it can give people time to build courage to provide information that they were too afraid to offer when the crime occurred, or it provides another opportunity for people who were too apprehensive about getting involved in a police investigation then.
Police ask anyone who may recognize the man or have any information about the crime, to please call Crime Stoppers at (888) 580-8477 or SDPD Homicide at (619) 531-2293.

476,Design and Outreach Underway For New County  Southeastern Live Well Center,The public will soon have opportunities to participate in the next steps of creating the Southeastern Live Well Center that will serve as a hub for community services in the San Diego neighborhood.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/design-and-outreach-underway-for-new-county-southeastern-live-well-center/,2021-02-19T15:43:20-08:00,"
The public will soon have opportunities to participate in the next steps of creating the Southeastern Live Well Center, which will serve as a hub for community services in the San Diego neighborhood.
The County of San Diego, along with the PCL Construction + Steinberg Hart design-build team and Project Management Advisors, Inc. as the acting owner’s representative for the County, are starting the design phase of the project at the corner of Market Street and Euclid Avenue. This phase is when details are refined for the concepts shared earlier and will include engaging groups that will work at the building along with community advisors on design.
In the coming months PCL will host outreach events for local businesses and community residents who are interested in learning more about the project and potential opportunities. For additional information and to be included in the upcoming bidder list please contact SELWCOutreach@pcl.com.
“The people who live and work in Southeastern San Diego are the greatest resource we have in shaping a facility to serve their needs,” said Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher. “It is critical that we not only listen to them, but ensure they have the opportunity to learn and benefit from the project’s construction.”
As the project moves forward, subcontractors will have the option to assist in the design development and the contractor will begin buyout of early trades. The County’s contract specifies local hiring and subcontracting participation, including $6 million of participation, from the project’s four local ZIP codes: 92102, 92113, 92114 and 92139.
“We look forward to a Southeastern Live Well Center that promotes the health and well-being of our residents and makes the community proud,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas. “Engaging residents in the design phase and seeking their feedback is key to fostering connection to the space, and a major first step to building healthier and stronger communities.”
Traffic studies for the Southeastern Live Well Center supported the need for medians on Euclid Avenue from Highway 94 to Imperial Avenue and a traffic signal on Market Street located at the project’s driveway, which will align with the Malcom X Library’s west parking lot entrance. The project also will provide contributions for future traffic improvements on Market Street’s intersections with 47th Street and Euclid Avenue. The County is currently working with the City of San Diego on a complete list of street improvements for Market Street along the project site.
Once constructed, the 65,000-square-foot Southeastern Live Well Center will provide a full array of community services including medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans’ services. The Southeastern Live Well Center also will have space for community meetings in its 4,000-square-foot conference center.
The Southeastern Live Well Center is expected to break ground in fall of 2021 and open in the summer of 2023.
As design work continues, the existing Tubman Chavez Community Center is providing an essential service as a COVID testing and vaccine site. Prior to start of construction there will a new nearby location for COVID testing and vaccination.
Information about the new Southeastern Live Well Center, its design and opportunities for public comment are available on a dedicated Live Well San Diego website page at https://www.livewellsd.org/content/livewell/home/community/live-well-communities/southeastern-live-well-center.html
Live Well Centers are operating in National City, Chula Vista, Escondido and Lemon Grove, a location that was extensively remodeled last year. A new Live Well Center recently opened in Oceanside.

State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 22.2 cases per 100,000 residents (as of Feb. 16) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The testing positivity percentage is 6.4%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for the Red Tier, the state uses the most restrictive metric – in this case the adjusted case rate – and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 9.7% and is in the Purple Tier or Tier 1. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.

480,"Public Defender, Probation Celebrate 10 Years of Veterans Treatment Court","This month the San Diego County Office of the Public Defender and Probation Department have been celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the local Veterans Treatment Court, a program that has helped more than 140 veterans and active-duty service members get specialized treatment instead of time in jail.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/public-defender-probation-celebrate-10-years-of-veterans-treatment-court/,2021-02-24T07:56:55-08:00,"
This month the San Diego County Office of the Public Defender and Probation Department have been celebrating the 10-year anniversary of the local Veterans Treatment Court, a program that has helped more than 140 veterans and active-duty service members get specialized treatment instead of time in jail.
Established in February 2011, Veterans Treatment Court is a specialty court that considers treatment in place of incarceration when sentencing a defendant who has served in the military and shows symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, military sexual trauma, depression, anxiety disorder, or other mental health conditions.
According to information provided by the San Diego Superior Court, Veterans Court participants take part in a three-phase treatment program that lasts between 15 and 60 months. Each phase consists of a set of requirements, including treatment specific to the individual’s needs and a project that gives back to the community. After a participant successfully completes the program, a judge can waive fees, commute felonies, or even expunge the charges entirely.
Angela Bartosik, the Chief Deputy Public Defender for San Diego County, said that since its inception Veterans Court has been a major asset to local veterans, many of whom have service-connected trauma and have found themselves involved in the criminal justice system.
“For the past 10 years, eligible clients have been provided much needed therapeutic treatment in lieu of lengthy incarceration,” said Bartosik, a retired Navy commander who served more than 20 years in the U.S. Navy and Navy Reserve.  “This rigorous recovery milieu includes treatment, mentorship by veterans, and accountability to the court.”
Bartosik said each graduate has been provided support for PTSD, substance abuse, physical trauma, and other health issues through program partnerships with the Veterans Administration and local nonprofits that specialize in care for former service members.
“This program has truly been a miracle in action, returning countless veterans to productive citizenship,” added Bartosik.  “We are grateful for the support of our justice partners – the district attorney, superior court, and probation department – in this amazing and transformative program.”
Denise Huffhines, San Diego County Probation Department Deputy Chief, said she agrees that it is the collaborative effort between all the local partner agencies that makes the program so successful.
“In the past 10 years, Veterans Court has helped quite a few individuals in San Diego County get the help they need while still meeting the requirements of their probation period,” said Huffhines. “The counseling and support these veterans receive as part of Veterans Court helps to lower crime, reduce recidivism, rebuild lives, and ultimately helps them to complete their probation period as part of sentencing.”
According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, San Diego County is home to the largest population of Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans in the country, and second only to Los Angeles County for total overall veteran population.
“Veterans Treatment Court is a great example of a criminal justice reform approach that holds offenders accountable but also addresses the particular challenges faced by our returning veterans, including PTSD, to help get them treatment for the underlying cause that has led them to criminal behavior so we can stop the revolving door to prison,” said San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan.
Part of the month-long observance included a virtual celebration on Feb. 23 that included speakers from many of the participating agencies as well as stories from program graduates and their mentors.
More information on the San Diego Veterans Treatment Court can be found on the District Attorney’s website at Veterans Court.

481,"Vaccinations To Open to Teachers, Law Enforcement, Food Workers on Saturday","The County of San Diego announced Wednesday that COVID-19 vaccinations will open Saturday, Feb. 27, to people who work in emergency services, child care and education, and food and agriculture (including grocery stores).  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/vaccinations-to-open-to-teachers-law-enforcement-food-workers-on-saturday/,2021-02-24T18:26:07-08:00,"
The County of San Diego announced Wednesday that COVID-19 vaccinations will open Saturday, Feb. 27, to people who work in emergency services, child care and education, and food and agriculture (including grocery stores).
Currently, health care personnel, long-term care facility staff and residents, and those who are 65 years and older are eligible for vaccines.
The County decided to open the vaccines to more people in Phase 1B, Tier 1 as vaccine supplies increase and more progress is made in vaccinating those currently eligible.
Three agencies will take the lead in vaccinating some of the newly eligible groups.
The San Diego County Office of Education and the California Schools VEBA will exclusively schedule appointments for transitional kindergarten (TK) through 12th grade teachers and staff through vebavaccinates.com. The priority will be schools open and planning to open, and then those closed, starting with those in the fourth quartile of the California Healthy Places Index (HPI).
“The state called for setting aside 10% of vaccine supply for education but the County of San Diego is going further,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten. “We are setting aside 20% to get teachers back in schools.”
Appointments exclusive to the law enforcement community will be organized by Scripps Health.
For farm workers in fields and rural locations, CAL FIRE and Operation Collaboration will take the lead in scheduling remote vaccination events.
All others eligible in the these groups can sign up for appointments through vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. However, patience is advised as the newly opened tier includes half a million people. Not everyone will be able to get an immediate appointment, but more time slots will open as additional vaccines arrive.
People with underlying conditions can begin signing up for vaccinations on March 15.
To date, over 828,000 COVID-19 doses have been delivered to the region with more than 777,000 administered. The difference between the two numbers represents approximately what is expected to be administered the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system. More than 6,200 doses were administered and pending documentation.
Those vaccinated to date include more than 196,000 San Diegans who are fully vaccinated, while 19.6% of the population over age 16 has received at least one dose.
More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County’s vaccination dashboard.

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 15 cases per 100,000 residents (as of Feb. 23) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The testing positivity percentage is 5%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier.

483,Make Sure Children Are Caught Up on Vaccines,"March 1-6, 2021 is Preteen Vaccine Week and County health officials say this is the ideal time for parents to catch up and make sure their children get all the recommended vaccines they may have missed.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/make-sure-children-are-caught-up-on-vaccines/,2021-02-26T09:34:53-08:00,"
Many childhood vaccines were missed last year because of concerns about COVID-19.
March 1-6, 2021 is Preteen Vaccine Week and County health officials say this is the ideal time for parents to catch up and make sure their children get all the recommended vaccines they may have missed.
“Vaccines help children to stay healthy and to protect themselves and others from contagious diseases, especially if they are doing in-person learning,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Parents should make sure their children have gotten all the recommended vaccines.”
Making sure students have all the required vaccines is part of the countywide Live Well San Diego vision, an effort to improve the health and well-being of residents in the region.  Staying up to date on vaccinations is also key to prevent you from getting diseases which, should you get infected with COVID-19, could result in worse outcomes.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adolescent children get immunized against the following diseases:

HPV
Boys and girls need all shots in the series for full protection. HPV vaccine for girls and young women prevents cervical cancer. The vaccine is also recommended for boys to prevent anal cancer and genital warts.
Meningococcal disease
Meningococcal bacteria are known to cause serious illnesses in children and adolescents. The bacteria can infect the blood and cause inflammation of the tissues covering the brain and the spinal cord. Ten percent of teens who become ill die, and another 15 percent suffer long-term disability such as loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems or brain damage.
Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (grouped in one vaccine called Tdap)
All students entering 7thgrade need proof of a Tdap booster in order to attend school.
Influenza
The flu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months and older. Even though influenza activity has been very mild this season, everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot.
Chickenpox
Chickenpox, or varicella, is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. While chickenpox is a mild disease for most people, it can be life-threatening for some. Two doses are recommended.

The above vaccines are available at physician offices, community clinics, and many retail pharmacies. People without medical insurance can get vaccinated at one of the seven County locations; call 2-1-1 for a location nearest you.

484,County Announces New Chief Medical Examiner,The County of San Diego has announced a new Chief Medical Examiner to lead an office with 57 personnel and a budget of $12.1 million responsible for the county’s medicolegal forensic death investigations.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-announces-new-chief-medical-examiner/,2021-02-26T11:33:45-08:00,"
The County of San Diego has announced a new Chief Medical Examiner to lead an office with 57 personnel and a budget of $12.1 million responsible for the county’s medicolegal forensic death investigations.
Dr. Steven Campman, the former Chief Deputy Medical Examiner who had been filling the director position in an interim capacity for the past four months, has officially accepted the role on a permanent basis.
In his new position as director, Campman said he hopes to continue the reputation of the office as being one of the top forensic pathology facilities in the country, as well as providing education and assistance to families of the deceased in a timely and professional manner.
“I want to make sure that the department is a valuable contributor to the safety and health of the people of the county by determining the cause and manner of death for all sudden and unexpected deaths in the county – making sure that we document what conditions cause unexpected death in our population,” said Campman, who has worked for San Diego County since 2001.
According to Campman, it is important that the medical examiner’s office learn from that information so that the region can guide resources and policies to improve overall health and safety in the future.
“Every single investigation is valuable, whether to the decedent’s family, or to attorneys or an insurance company,” said Campman. “But what we can learn from all deaths together is valuable to understanding what is going on in our community.”
Campman said a lot of people don’t know that San Diego County has the second largest coroner-medical examiner system in the state of California.
“It makes sense when you think about the county’s population being about 1% of the whole nation’s population,” added Campman.
Prior to joining the county, Campman worked for the Armed Forces Medical Examiner and served more than 20 years in the U.S. Air Force and Air Force Reserve, retiring as a colonel in 2016. He has conducted more than 5,000 autopsies, served as an autopsy supervisor for more than 800 cases, testified in hundreds of court proceedings, and he has been published more than a dozen times in medical journals and forensic/pathology publications
Campman said the San Diego Medical Examiner’s Office faced several challenges last year, not just with COVID-19 but also with fentanyl-related deaths and overall case volume.
“We had initial jurisdiction over about 41% of the more than 25,000 deaths registered in San Diego County in 2020 and ended up transporting about 14% of those decedents back to the facility for examination to determine cause of death,” said Campman. “Last year’s case volume was the greatest we’ve ever investigated at 3,853.”
In addition to COVID, Campman said the office helps ensure county residents are living safely by providing important data to government officials on societal issues such as the rise in fentanyl-related cases, the opioid epidemic, methamphetamine abuse, suicides, child fatalities and homeless deaths. Campman said this data can then be used to help San Diego County government agencies implement programs to address current trends and to target the most vulnerable residents.
“The department is here for the residents of the county,” said Campman. “Every member of the Medical Examiner’s staff is here because they’ve chosen to serve in this capacity and values the unique ways that we can help people.”
Campman is a graduate of Loyola Marymount University and Creighton University School of Medicine and completed his residency at UC Davis Medical Center Dept of Pathology and his fellowship through UC Davis at the Sacramento County Coroner’s Office.

Beginning tomorrow, San Diegans who work in emergency services, child care and education, food handling and agriculture can sign up for COVID-19 vaccination appointments. Those making appointments will be required to show a photo ID and proof of eligibility. Please keep in mind that vaccine supplies are still limited, so patience is required over the next several weeks.
Eligibility documents vary for the respective sectors but include a pay stub or timesheet issued within the last 90 days, an employee ID card, or a letter from the employer.
Each of the newly-eligible sectors includes a wide variety of occupations and there are employer-coordinated vaccination plans in place for certain subsets of those groups.
For example, law enforcement officers will have their vaccination appointments coordinated by Scripps Health, regardless of their insurance carrier. Education staff working in TK through 12th grade who are covered by California Schools VEBA, must use vebavaccinates.com and should not show up at any vaccination site prior to an appointment confirmed through VEBA. Education staff working at childcare facilities or institutions of higher education should make appointments at any County Point of Dispensing (POD), Super Station or other vaccination location.
Those not covered by specific vaccination plans for their occupation should contact their primary care doctor or schedule an appointment at vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. Appointments are required at County-operated sites and people will not be able to obtain the vaccination without a confirmed appointment.
“We are asking anyone trying to make a vaccination appointment for patience,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The tier that is opening tomorrow includes half a million people and not everyone will be able to get an immediate appointment this weekend. More time slots will continuously be released as additional vaccine doses arrive in the region.”
Vaccination Site Updates
A new appointment-only vaccination site opens on Sunday at the Copley-Price YMCA located at 4300 El Cajon Boulevard in City Heights. The walk-up clinic is open Tuesday to Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. and on Saturdays from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
Due to a national shortage of Moderna vaccine, the UC San Diego Super Station at Petco Park will be closed from Saturday, Feb. 27 through Tuesday, March 2. People with appointments will be notified via MyChart.
Vaccination Progress
To date, more than 938,000 COVID-19 doses have been delivered to the region with close to 833,000 administered. The difference between the two numbers represents approximately what is expected to be administered the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system. More than 8,500 doses were administered and are pending full documentation.
Those vaccinated to date include nearly 233,000 San Diegans who are fully vaccinated, while more than one in five San Diegans over age of 16 has received at least one dose.
Following a positive advisory committee meeting regarding the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Friday it would rapidly work toward finalization and issuance of an emergency use authorization for this vaccine. The County expects to receive an unknown quantity of the vaccine sometime next week.
More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County’s vaccination dashboard.
State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 15 cases per 100,000 residents (as of Feb. 23) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The testing positivity percentage is 5%, placing the County in Tier 2 or the Red Tier.

489,Emergency Rental Assistance Applications Now Open,Low-income San Diegans who have experienced a financial impact due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can now apply for rental and utility assistance grants from the County.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/emergency-rental-assistance-applications-now-open/,2021-03-02T17:01:26-08:00,"
Low-income San Diegans who have experienced a financial impact due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic can now apply for rental and utility assistance grants from the County.
During the COVID-19 update to the County Board of Supervisors Tuesday, David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services, said San Diegans can apply for financial assistance to help lessen housing cost burdens and maintain housing stability.
The County’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program is funded by over $100 million in state and federal monies.
To be eligible, households must be renting and have experienced a financial hardship related to COVID-19 or have qualified for unemployment during the pandemic.
Both landlords and tenants can apply; however, tenants will have to co-sign applications submitted by the landlord.
For more information or to apply, visit www.sdhcd.org. The application period will be open for three weeks and will be extended if necessary.
“If you’ve received assistance through a past rent or utility assistance program, you may still apply for the outstanding rent or utilities that have not been covered,” Estrella said.
The County’s Emergency Rental Assistance Program will assist San Diego residents countywide, except for those residing in the cities of San Diego and Chula Vista. Residents of San Diego and Chula Vista can visit http://www.ERAPSanDiego.org for information about rental assistance programs in those cities.

490,County Residents Graduate from First Spanish Language Sheriff’s Academy,"A group of 36 residents of San Diego County graduated Feb. 17 from the “Academia de Alguacil,” the first-of-its-kind Spanish language sheriff’s academy sponsored by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-residents-graduate-from-first-spanish-language-sheriffs-academy/,2021-03-03T10:34:44-08:00,"
A group of 36 residents of San Diego County graduated Feb. 17 from the “Academia de Alguacil,” the first-of-its-kind Spanish language sheriff’s academy sponsored by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.
Delivered virtually via Zoom and entirely in Spanish, the five-week program was designed as a relationship-building program to help provide equity in educating one of the county’s most vulnerable populations about law enforcement procedures and available resources in San Diego County.
Nadia Moshirian Binderup, San Diego Sheriff’s Department Community Inclusion Director, said the program started with a coordinated effort involving the San Diego County Office of Education – Migrant Education Program. Participants were parents of children who participate in the migrant education program.
“The migrant community is part of the diverse fabric of our region, and one’s citizenship status or language preference shouldn’t be a barrier or a reason for the community to feel like they can’t be safe or have access to public safety services,” said Binderup. “Knowing our migrant youth oftentimes serve as family spokespersons due to language barriers faced by parents, we wanted to make sure we equipped parents with helpful resources and information.”
Binderup said in the past the Sheriff’s Department has worked with the San Diego District Attorney’s Office to offer the joint Citizens’ Academy, which helps residents understand how law enforcement and the justice system intersect. However, she said this program is different.
“Academia de Alguacil differs in that it was designed with cultural needs at the forefront; we designed the curriculum and presentations entirely in Spanish and approached the curriculum based on reoccurring themes and needs we see and hear based on what our deputies experience in the communities,” said Binderup. “The program hosts were Hispanic deputy sheriffs from various rankings and assignments in the department to bring different expertise to the conversation.”
According to Lt. Ricardo Lopez, the San Diego Sheriff’s Department Media Relations Director who served as lead facilitator for the program, some of the topics covered during the course included immigration laws, what to expect at traffic stops, domestic violence, drug addiction, human trafficking, hate crimes, gangs, and how to become a deputy sheriff.
“There were questions and concerns on immigration enforcement every week,” said Lopez. “I believe we definitely cleared up some questions and concerns they had for what we do and more importantly what we don’t do. In the end, they left with a much better understanding of our role when it comes to immigration enforcement.”
Lopez said one of the greatest benefits of the program was allowing the Sheriff’s Department to develop a relationship that built trust and made it a comfortable environment in which to ask some very important questions. Several of the participants said they had been waiting a long time to ask specific questions and were relieved to finally be able to do so.
“At first they were very quiet and asked a couple of questions, but by the end of our fifth week the questions they asked became the main focus and source of conversation of the presentations,” said Lopez. “They became more comfortable with us and saw us as being just like them; being able to break the barriers of communication adds a lot to having meaningful conversations.”
Lopez said those who attended the program were not only able to receive information in their native language but to also see that local law enforcement share similar family backgrounds, struggles, and values.
“There was a participant who said that before the Spanish Academy she was afraid to call the police, but after meeting us and hearing our presentations, she said she would never be afraid to call again,” said Lopez. “That was great to hear and really what this academy is all about.”
The Sheriff’s Department said it hopes to offer the class at least twice a year, either virtually or in person, as future COVID-19 restrictions dictate.

491,"Board Votes to Restore, Improve El Monte River Valley Land in Lakeside","Calling it a great project for the entire region, San Diego County’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to set aside $6.44 million to restore and improve roughly 98 acres of newly acquired open space, trails and recreational facilities in El Monte River Valley in Lakeside.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-votes-to-restore-improve-el-monte-river-valley-land-in-lakeside/,2021-03-03T14:57:35-08:00,"
Calling it a great project for the entire region, San Diego County’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to set aside $6.44 million to restore and improve roughly 98 acres of newly acquired open space, trails and recreational facilities in El Monte River Valley in Lakeside.
The Board previously voted Feb. 10 to spend $3.2 million to buy the property that includes important coastal sage scrub, riparian scrub and riparian forest habitats, open space and already existing equestrian and youth sports playing fields.
Board members envision the land as the home for future trail connections to other County parks, and recreational facilities for the public to enjoy in addition to the open space. The land is located nearby the County’s existing Cactus County and Louis A. Stelzer parks, and its future $18 million Lakeside Equestrian Park.
Supervisor Joel Anderson, who represents the County’s second district that includes Lakeside, said he was excited about the project and that the $6.44 million will help restore the land to its pristine nature and let people enjoy and hike through it.
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher said the project could also provide an important piece of the planned San Diego River Park Regional Trail.
“This can be a wonderful regional asset,” Fletcher said. “Of particular importance it also helps us with another step toward completing the San Diego River Park — this is the vision of 52 miles of interconnected walkways and bikeways (running) all the way from Ocean Beach to the mountains. This is an incredible opportunity and this is one piece of that puzzle, a section of that that we can complete.”
The $6.44 million the Board of Supervisors agreed to use to restore the property Wednesday would spend:

$2,641,000 to improve and expand the existing Little League ballfield, including rehabilitating the existing field and adding new accessible pathways, restrooms and parking improvements, replacing the existing concession building and restrooms, irrigation and amenities like bleachers and tables.
$800,000 on trails, including design, environmental work and trail construction.
$3 million to restore habitat, including removing invasive species like tamarisk, pepper and eucalyptus trees, and planting and seeding with native vegetation that would include a five-year maintenance and monitoring plan.

492,Second Doses Are Priority at Local Vaccination Sites,"Given the ongoing shortage in supply of COVID-19 vaccine doses in the region, local vaccinations sites are prioritizing people with second appointments.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/second-doses-are-priority-at-local-vaccination-sites/,2021-03-03T17:42:19-08:00,"
Given the ongoing shortage in supply of COVID-19 vaccine doses in the region, local vaccination sites are prioritizing people with second appointments.
Two conflating issues are delaying the release of new appointments for San Diegans who want to get their first dose. One is a shortage of Moderna doses coming into the region to make up for the shipments delayed a few weeks ago by bad weather across the country. The other is that Pfizer doses that have arrived are being used almost exclusively to vaccinate people who are due to receive their second dose of vaccine.
While some first-dose appointments have been released for use by the County and its partners, they are reserved under state guidelines for groups such as law enforcement, teachers and other school personnel.
“Our sites are working diligently to complete the vaccinations of people who are due for their second doses,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “When we get through the Moderna backlog, and more doses arrive, including the new Johnson and Johnson vaccine, first-dose appointments will be released for the many people who are both eligible and eager to get vaccinated.”
Vaccination Progress
Local vaccination sites are currently providing vaccine to San Diegans in Phase 1A and Phase 1B.
To date, nearly 1,070,000 COVID-19 doses have been delivered to the region with close to 946,000 administered. The difference between the two numbers represents approximately what is expected to be administered the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system. Nearly 7,400 doses were administered and are pending full documentation.
Those vaccinated to date include nearly 290,000 San Diegans who are fully vaccinated, while more than 22% of San Diegans over age of 16 have received at least one dose, representing nearly 595,000 people.
State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 10.8 cases per 100,000 residents (as of March 2) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The testing positivity percentage is 4.2%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for Tier 3, the state uses the most restrictive metric – in this case the adjusted case rate – and assigns counties to that tier.

The California Department of Public Health assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, March. 9.

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 10.8 cases per 100,000 residents (as of March 2) and the region is in Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The testing positivity percentage is 4.2%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. While the testing positivity rate for the County qualifies it for Tier 3, the state uses the most restrictive metric – in this case the adjusted case rate – and assigns counties to that tier. Therefore, the County remains in the Purple Tier or Tier 1.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 6% and is in the Red Tier or Tier 2. This metric does not move counties to more restrictive tiers but is required to advance to a less restrictive tier.

495,County Surpasses 1 Million COVID-19 Vaccinations,"More than a million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-surpasses-1-million-covid-19-vaccinations/,2021-03-05T18:12:00-08:00,"
More than a million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.
Of those vaccinated to date, more than 319,000, or nearly 12 percent of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized. A total of 619,924 people, or 23.1 percent, have received at least one dose of the two-dose regimen.
“We are making great progress in vaccinating San Diegans but it is too soon to let our guard down,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Herd immunity does not occur until at least 70 percent of the population 16 and older is fully vaccinated and we have a ways to go before we can get back to many of the things we miss.”
The region’s vaccination efforts are slowed by shortages in vaccine supply, forcing several vaccination sites across the region to pause.
The following sites will be paused through Monday: the Lemon Grove Community Center, the Central Region Immunization Clinic in Logan Heights, the Copley-Price YMCA in City Heights, the Martin Luther King Community Center in National City, the Border View YMCA in Otay Mesa and the Linda Rhoades Recreation Center in Vista. The North Coastal Live Well Center in Oceanside is closed but will open Monday for second doses. Additional information about the temporary closures of the vaccination sites can be accessed here.
Vaccination Progress:

Of the 1.1 million COVID-19 vaccine doses delivered to the region, more than 1,026,000 have been logged as administered. Of those vaccinated to date, more than 319,000, or nearly 12 percent of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.
Overall, more than 619,000 County residents have received at least one shot of two-dose vaccine. That’s 23.1 percent of those eligible.
The difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.

497,County Officials Highlight Early Success of Mobile Crisis Response Team Program,County officials on Monday discussed the debut of a new County program designed to help people experiencing mental health or substance use crises by dispatching behavioral health experts to emergency calls instead of law enforcement when appropriate,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-officials-highlight-early-success-of-mobile-crisis-response-team-program/,2021-03-08T13:59:22-08:00,"
County officials Monday discussed the debut of a new County program designed to help people experiencing mental health or substance use crises by dispatching behavioral health experts to emergency calls instead of law enforcement when appropriate.
Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher, County District Attorney Summer Stephan, County behavioral health officials and representatives from Exodus Recovery, Inc. held a socially distanced event outside the County Administration Center to share information about the Mobile Crisis Response Team program (MCRT) that was launched in January.
During the 2019-2020 fiscal year, local law enforcement agencies received more than 54,000 calls involving a psychiatric crisis.
Now, the County’s pilot program is giving an alternative to San Diegans in North County coastal communities who need assistance with behavioral health crises that do not require law enforcement intervention.
Using the County’s Access and Crisis Line (888-724-7240) as the initial point of contact, a non-law enforcement MCRT is deployed to assess these types of situations and offer help.
“Communities are demanding change,” Fletcher said, “because they understand law enforcement is not the appropriate response to deal with someone who is experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis. This new team is an alternative to dispatching law enforcement when a person is having a psychiatric crisis.”
The North County MCRT pilot is responding to calls in the communities of Del Mar, Carlsbad, Vista, Encinitas, Solana Beach, Oceanside and Camp Pendleton. Teams provide non-law enforcement crisis intervention, triage and assessment services in the field to connect people to additional care, when needed, to prevent acute psychiatric crises from escalating.
“Mental health, homelessness and drug use frequently intersect with the criminal justice system and too often the outcomes fall short of helping people who face these challenges,” District Attorney Summer Stephan said. “That’s why our Blueprint for Mental Health Reform recommended (these) Mobile Crisis Response Teams — so that those suffering mental health crisis get a compassionate and effective response while at the same time keeping our region safe.
“I often hear from mothers whose sons who have stopped taking their medication,” Stephan said, “and begin exhibiting signs of distress and are in need immediate help from professionals, but are only left with the alternative of calling police. The MCRT will give these families another option.”
County Behavioral Health Services Assistant Director Cecily Thornton-Stearns emphasized that the MCRT respond to psychiatric emergencies only when they’re deemed not to involve threats of violence. She said the makeup of the teams, which consist of licensed mental health clinicians, case managers and peer support specialists, was extremely important.
“These clinical teams can triage and link the individual to appropriate services,” Thornton-Stearns said, “and can even provide transportation if needed. If a situation evolves and requires the presence of law enforcement, team members can call for assistance, and PERT (Psychiatric Emergency Response Team), or other uniformed personnel, will be dispatched.”
The program operates during normal business hours through the Access and Crisis Line, with on-call capacity for after hours, and may expand based on utilization. Services are provided through an HHSA contract with Exodus Recovery, Inc., an experienced provider of crisis care.
Additional teams will also be ramping up throughout the county over the next year and may utilize 911 call dispatch. As services expand, the County will continue to work closely with the law enforcement community to ensure the safety of MCRT staff and residents remains a priority.
County officials said providing access to care is essential to the County’s Live Well San Diego vision, which aims to improve the health and safety of all residents.
The County funds prevention and treatment services throughout the region. If you, or someone you care about, needs treatment, please call the Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240.

498,Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 Vaccine Arrives in San Diego,The arrival on the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine will make it easier for San Diegans to be vaccinated against the virus.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-arrives-in-san-diego/,2021-03-08T18:16:58-08:00,"
The arrival of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine will make it easier for San Diegans to be vaccinated against the virus.
The one-shot vaccine has arrived in the region and is being distributed the same way as the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
Some people have shown hesitancy to getting the latest COVID-19 vaccine given that it was 72% effective in research trials in the United States, compared to about 94% for Moderna and 95% for Pfizer after those vaccines’ required two doses.
However, health officials say the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is just as effective as its counterparts at preventing serious illness from COVID-19 and was tested against virus variants. Also, all currently available vaccines were 100% effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths during trials.
“San Diegans should get whichever vaccine is available when it’s their turn to get vaccinated,” Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “All three vaccines are excellent at preventing people from getting seriously ill from COVID-19.”
Local vaccination sites are currently providing vaccine to San Diegans in Phase 1A and Phase 1B. Supplies remain limited.
“Regardless of which shot you get, you’ll be protected from serious complications from COVID-19 and will be able to protect others who are waiting their turn to be vaccinated,” Wooten said.
Vaccination Progress:

More than 1.15 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and over 1.04 million have been logged as administered. Of those vaccinated to date, nearly 342,000 people, or 12.7% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.
Overall, more than 643,000 County residents have received at least one shot of two-dose vaccine. That’s 23.9% of those eligible.
The difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.

503,County to Move to Red Tier March 17,"Given that the state has met a mark of vaccinating 2 million people in the communities hardest hit  by COVID-19, it has revised its tier system, and San Diego County is expected to move to the Red Tier for activities March 17.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-move-to-red-tier-march-17/,2021-03-12T18:23:58-08:00,"
Given that the state has met a mark of vaccinating 2 million people in the communities hardest hit  by COVID-19, it has revised its tier system, and San Diego County is expected to move to the Red Tier for activities March 17.
The change in tiers will allow indoor operations to resume, at limited capacity and with modifications, at restaurants, gyms, movie theaters and other establishments.
San Diego and 11 other counties are moving to the less restrictive Red Tier, which now requires a case rate of four to 10 COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents. San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 8.8 cases per 100,000 residents.
“This is great news for our region. San Diegans have done a good job following the public health guidance and that has driven our case rate down in recent weeks,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Our vaccination efforts have also helped to slow the spread of COVID-19. As more people get vaccinated, the number of cases should continue to decrease.”
The County must remain in the Red Tier and post two consecutive weeks of data in the in the Orange Tier before moving to the less restrictive level which would ease more restrictions.
Currently, the testing positivity percentage is 3.3%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier. The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 4.5% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3. These metrics are also expected to decrease when the state announces tier assignments March 16.
While two of the three metrics qualify the County for the Orange Tier or Tier 3, the state assigns counties to the most restrictive tier.
When the state administers 4 million doses in the vaccine equity quartile, tier assignments will be revised once again.
San Diegans With Chronic Illnesses Eligible for Vaccine Monday
Starting March 15, people between 16 and 64 years of age who have a severe health condition will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The vaccine is being made available to people in this category because they are deemed to be at high risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to their pre-existing medical condition.
“People with chronic health conditions should get vaccinated as soon as possible,” Wooten said. “All the vaccines currently available are 100% effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19.”
San Diegans with a developmental or other severe high-risk disability will also be eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
People in Phase 1 are encouraged to get vaccinated by their health care provider. San Diegans without a doctor should contact 2-1-1 to be connected to a provider or make an appointment at www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com.
San Diegans who have a health care provider don’t have show proof of an existing medical condition because their medical history is already on file and doctors should be inviting their patients to get vaccinated when it’s their turn. People without a health care provider will be asked to sign a self-attestation form indicating they have one of the chronic conditions listed.
An older man gets his COVID-19 vaccine at County Oceanside clinic.
Breweries Without Food Can Open
Beginning March 13, breweries, wineries and distilleries that do not serve meals may open outdoors only with modifications.
Patrons visiting these establishments must have reservations and must observe a 90-minute time limit. Also, service for on-site consumption must end by 8 p.m. The updated guidance does not apply to breweries, wineries and distilleries that provide meals.
Vaccination Progress:

More than 1.27 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and over 1.18 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.
Of those vaccinated to date, nearly 400,000 County residents, or 14.8% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.
Overall, nearly 688,000 County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That’s 25.6% of those eligible.
Those receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.
The difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.
More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County’s vaccination dashboard. For details on groups currently eligible and vaccination opportunities, visit www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.

507,Supervisors Approve Little Libraries Initiative,County supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to create a “little libraries” initiative to boost literacy in low-income and communities of color by giving the people and children living in them more opportunities to have books to read in their homes.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/supervisors-approve-little-libraries-initiative/,2021-03-16T17:33:06-07:00,"
San Diego County’s Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to create a “little libraries” initiative to boost literacy in low-income and communities of color by giving the people and children living in them more opportunities to have books to read in their homes.
Supervisor Nora Vargas, who brought the item to the Board for consideration, said the County library system has “been fantastic” in promoting and increasing literacy through its 33 branch libraries, digital and e-books, services and programs.
But Vargas said low income and communities of color, including some in District 1 that she represents, often face obstacles that prevent them from taking advantage of those services, such as lack of access to transportation and financial constraints that hamper internet access and book-buying. She said studies show having books to read in homes improves learning success and a “little libraries” initiative could help put more books in homes.
Little libraries are mailbox like structures put up in communities to create neighborhood book exchanges where people can freely borrow or leave books for others to read. They can be found all around San Diego County, but Vargas said there are just four in her District 1, serving a population of roughly 650,000.
“Residents can borrow books as they like and return them afterward as an honor-based system,” Vargas said. “The motto being ‘take a book and share a book.’”
With the Board’s vote Tuesday, the County Library will work with the San Diego Council on Literacy, nonprofits like the national Little Free Library Organization, the County’s Friends of Library groups, and volunteer groups to increase the number of little libraries.
“The reality is there are vast disparities,” Vargas said. “And many communities’ children don’t have access to age-appropriate books at home, which causes them to fall behind. This initiative today is going to address disparities seen in disadvantaged communities by promoting and encouraging reading from home and by creating more access to literature.”

The state notified the County today that it will be allowed to lift some COVID-19 restrictions starting Wednesday and move from the most restrictive Purple Tier into the less restrictive Red Tier. The change in tiers will allow restaurants, gyms, movie theaters and other businesses to begin moving operations indoors with capacity limits.
Beginning tomorrow, restaurants and movie theaters will be allowed to resume indoor operations at 25 percent capacity, or 100 people, whichever is fewer. Gyms and fitness centers will be allowed to reopen indoor operations at 10 percent of their indoor capacity. Museums, zoos and aquariums will be able to open indoor operations at 25 percent capacity and retail and shopping centers will be able to increase their indoor operations to 50% capacity.
All establishments will still be required to follow social distancing and face covering guidelines for their employees and patrons.
“It is because of the efforts of our community that the County is able to move back into the Red Tier after four months of Purple Tier restrictions,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “However, the relaxing of restrictions should not encourage San Diegans to let their guard down. We are urging community members to continue to do their part, get vaccinated once they are eligible and take the necessary precautions to avoid getting and spreading COVID-19.”
Vaccination Progress:

More than 1.41 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and over 1.27 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.

509,"Board Votes to Buy, Conserve Historic Star Ranch Land in Campo","County supervisors have voted to buy the 2,151-acre, historic Star Ranch area in Campo, its largest acquisition of sensitive habitat, wetlands, potential passive park land and hiking trails in a decade.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-votes-to-buy-conserve-historic-star-ranch-land-in-campo/,2021-03-17T16:32:23-07:00,"
San Diego County supervisors voted Wednesday to buy the 2,151-acre, historic Star Ranch area in Campo, its largest acquisition of sensitive habitat, wetlands, potential passive park land and hiking trails in a decade.
County officials said the land will provide a permanent home for sensitive species and conserve important habitat including 200 acres of wetlands, and it could eventually provide a large park and connections for hikers to nearby trails such as the Pacific Crest Trail.
The Board voted unanimously to buy the land for roughly $8.7 million, a figure that will be offset by a $1.28 million contribution from the U.S. Navy, which operates a training base nearby and needs to maintain a buffer around it to keep it isolated.
The ranch is located a mile north of the U.S.-Mexico border in Campo near State Route 94 and Buckman Springs Road, just north of the County Park’s Campo Stone Store Museum. The store itself is a historic landmark rebuilt in stone in 1875.
County parks department officials said the land fits into the County’s future East County Multiple Species Conservation Plan area. They said the purchase will permanently protect its chaparral, wetland and riparian habitats that are home to animals including the coastal horned lizard, two-striped garter snake, Cooper’s hawk, white-tailed hawk and the federally protected least Bell’s vireo and arroyo toad. Because the land also connects to hundreds of acres of federal land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, its acquisition will also create important wildlife corridors for animals to travel.
County officials said keeping the land from being developed will also contribute to the County’s drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating nearly 3,000 metric tons of emissions.

517,"More Meals to be Served to Unsheltered through Sheriff, Nonprofit Partnership","The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously March 16 to execute a new three-year agreement between the County, San Diego County Sheriff’s Department, and the local nonprofit Lucky Duck Foundation to help prepare and distribute 1,000 daily meals to unsheltered residents seven days a week.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/more-meals-to-be-served-to-unsheltered-through-sheriff-nonprofit-partnership/,2021-03-23T16:13:37-07:00,"
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously March 16 to execute a new three-year agreement between the County, San Diego County Sheriff’s Department, and the local nonprofit Lucky Duck Foundation to help prepare and distribute more than 2,000 daily meals to unsheltered residents seven days a week.
“The San Diego Sheriff’s Department is honored to work with The Lucky Duck Foundation in providing food for the unsheltered. Meeting our community’s basic needs supports the health and overall wellness of our community members,” Sheriff’s Commander Will Brown said.
The agreement expands a previous pilot program from last year between the County and Lucky Duck Foundation in which the Sheriff’s Department provided food, food preparation, and delivery service to the foundation’s two distribution locations in the county three times a week.
Drew Moser, Executive Director of the Lucky Duck Foundation, said the Sheriff’s Department’s involvement has been key to the program’s success and expansion from feeding 400 people per day to more than 1,000 people per day. Brown said Sheriff Bill Gore agreed to expand the service because he knew his department already has the infrastructure in place to produce and package meals on a large scale and his staff have a passion and commitment to serving people
“The Sheriff’s Department’s commercial kitchen, which already generates more than 15,000 meals a day, is a great resource that enables these meals to be made, packed, and delivered,” said Moser. “And the cost of the meals, given the County’s buying power, makes this program scalable so that philanthropy can cover the costs of all meals.”
Moser said after the meals are prepared by the Sheriff’s Department and transported to Lucky Duck Foundation distribution sites in Miramar and Chula Vista. Volunteers at those sites sort and organize the meals for more than 30 outreach teams from 25 different social service agencies that blanket the county to deliver the meals to people living on the streets.
“The objective is two-fold,” said Moser. “It provides nourishment and equips outreach workers with an important tool for building trust and rapport to help the homeless end their homelessness by connecting them to available resources.”
Moser said the program also employs formerly homeless individuals, one of whom serves as a distribution site coordinator.

518,San Diegan Tests Positive for COVID-19 Variant First Identified in Brazil,"A San Diego woman in her late 40s is the first local case of the COVID-19 variant first identified in Brazil, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-woman-tests-positive-for-brazilian-covid-19-variant/,2021-03-24T17:01:37-07:00,"
A San Diego woman in her late 40s is the first local case of the COVID-19 variant first identified in Brazil, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The woman’s sample was collected on March 5 and went through genome sequencing, which is not available until 2-4 weeks after testing.
The woman had not been vaccinated, was not hospitalized and, since she had no known travel history, is believed to have been exposed to someone in the community. The case investigation identified six close contacts outside the woman’s household.
A second case of the P.1 or Brazilian variant was detected locally, but the person, who also had not been vaccinated, is not a San Diego County resident.  Four cases of the P.1 coronavirus variant have been reported in California through March 19.
There is some evidence that the P.1 and other new variants are more easily spread, but the P.1 variant is not believed to cause more severe illness or increase the risk of death.
“San Diegans should not be alarmed. The COVID-19 vaccines currently available do offer some protection against most of the variants,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People should continue taking the preventive measures that work against all variants of the novel coronavirus.”
San Diegans should do the following now more than ever:

Wear a mask
Watch your distance from others
Wash your hands
When it’s your turn, get vaccinated

Through March 23, a total of 336 cases of the B.1.1.7, known as the UK variant, had been identified in the region. No cases of the variant first identified in South Africa have been reported in the region.
A report on the COVID-19 variants is published every Wednesday at www.coronavirus-sd.com.
Vaccination Progress:

Nearly 1.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and more than 1.5 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.

Those receiving the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.
The difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.

522,10 Years Later – Remembering the Great Japan Tsunami and to Prepare,"Ten years ago this month, the world watched as a 9.1 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the eastern coast of Japan.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/10-years-later-remembering-the-great-japan-tsunami-and-to-prepare/,2021-03-29T14:48:07-07:00,"
Ten years ago this month, the world watched as a 9.1 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami devastated the eastern coast of Japan.
The combined events caused over $360 billion in damage and washed 1.5 million tons of debris, including wrecked cars, buildings and homes, into the ocean. The tsunami also flooded Japan’s Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant, which melted its cores and leaked radiation. More than 18,000 people died, and many others were reported missing.
The California coast experienced over $100 million in damage. Locally, tsunami surges and strong currents caused flooding and minor damage, mainly to the boating community. The County of San Diego Office of Emergency Services and San Diego County’s hazardous materials division also worked with local, state and federal agencies to develop emergency plans to document and handle debris that could potentially wash ashore in the years following.
The events on March 11, 2011 have helped shape local and statewide emergency planning and preparedness efforts and serve as a lasting reminder of the importance of being prepared. While tsunamis are rare along San Diego’s 70 miles of coastline, it is important to know your risks and be prepared. Whether you work, live, or visit the coast, here are some simple and no-cost steps you can take to be this tsunami preparedness week to be ready for tsunamis:

Use the Know Your Hazards map tool to discover your level of risk for local hazards, like tsunamis.
Make a disaster plan for yourself and loved ones.
Register your cell phone and email with AlertSanDiego, the region’s emergency mass notification system.
Review your local tsunami evacuation routes and know important landmarks and potential flood areas.
Know what to do: If you are on the beach or in a low-lying coastal area and feel a strong earthquake – drop, cover, and hold on, and then immediately move inland and to higher ground to a safe location.
If you have school age children or are a teacher – watch and share this video with your classroom. (Spanish)

The California Geological Survey has also put together a summary of the Japan Tsunami along with what happened to our coast, and the Redwood Coast Tsunami Work Group has compiled videos from tsunami observers in California.

524,Distributing COVID-19 Vaccines Equitably ,"The County is continuing to expand its efforts to equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccines to populations who have suffered the worst outcomes from the pandemic. In February, the County began piloting multiple health-equity focused methods to ensure that eligible County residents who live in the hardest-hit communities can get vaccinated outside of the traditional online appointment system. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/distributing-covid-19-vaccines-equitably/,2021-03-30T12:18:35-07:00,"
The County is continuing to expand its efforts to equitably distribute COVID-19 vaccines to populations who have suffered the worst outcomes from the pandemic. In February, the County began piloting multiple health-equity focused methods to ensure that eligible County residents who live in the hardest-hit communities can get vaccinated outside of the traditional online appointment system. 
To reach these populations, the County launched Project SAVE (Scheduling Assistance for Vaccine Equity). As part of Project SAVE, a certain number of appointments are set aside each day for people who are eligible, at vaccination sites in communities most impacted by COVID-19.  
The pilot focused on South County, an area that included National City, Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and San Ysidro, some of the local communities with the highest COVID-19 case rates and deaths.  
County-funded community health workers, sometimes known as promotoras, began reaching out to residents and workers in these areas to assist with scheduling vaccination appointments and providing information and other resources. The County saw a need for this program because many community members in those areas have language barriers or need other assistance from someone who can navigate the vaccination signup process.  
Having a trained member of the community, from a trusted community-based organization, helps to break down barriers to vaccine access. Project Save partners include The Chicano Federation, San Diego Latino Health Coalition, Mental Health America of San Diego, Multicultural Health Foundation, Somali Family Services of San Diego, United Women of East Africa, Union of Pan Asian Communities (UPAC), Southern Indian Health Council, San Diego American Indian Health Center, Indian Health Council Inc., San Diego Refugee Communities Coalition, True Care and Casa Familiar.  
For the hard-hit border community, the County opened the Border View YMCA in Otay Mesa as the region’s first no-appointment vaccination site with a capacity to serve up to 500 people a day.  
The Health and Human Services Agency divides the county into six administrative regions. The vaccine efforts resulted in the South Region having the highest percentage of vaccinated seniors and second-highest per capita vaccination rate of all the regions. 
In recent weeks, Project SAVE has expanded to include the 92058 ZIP code, surrounding the North Coastal Live Well Health Center in Oceanside; two ZIP codes in City Heights and Mid-City (92105 and 92115), for the College Area Viejas Arena site and, this week, three ZIP codes south of downtown and in southeastern San Diego (92113, 92102 and 92114), for the Educational Cultural Complex site in Mountain View. Appointments are also being set aside under Project SAVE for vaccinations at the Mexican Consulate in downtown San Diego.   
Soon to be added to Project SAVE are communities served by the following vaccination sites: Linda Rhoades Recreation Center in Vista, North Inland First United Methodist Church of Escondido, Lemon Grove Community Center, and Tubman Chavez Community Center. 
“We started the Project SAVE pilot with the knowledge that residents of the South Bay experienced some of the worst health outcomes during the course of this pandemic,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The County is committed to health equity and our goal remains to make vaccines available to every San Diegan, as quickly as possible, with a special focus on those residents who are at the highest risk for severe outcomes from COVID-19.” 
In addition to Project SAVE, other ongoing equity initiatives include: serving long-term care facilities; Homeless Outreach Teams for people experiencing homelessness; mobile teams for homebound individuals; 2-1-1 to secure appointments for seniors; and Operation Collaboration first responders visiting farms to vaccinate the workforce. The County also provides vaccine to equity-focused organizations, such as the San Diego Black Nurses Association and Champions For Health.  
While vaccine availability is expanding, the number of doses available daily at each site can vary based on actual vaccine supply. More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County’s COVID-19 vaccination dashboard.

527,"County Library Opens Digital, Audio Bookshelves to Local Students","Thousands of local students in 19 schools and districts have a whole new world of digital and audio books to read and listen to, thanks to the County Library — and they won’t even need a library card.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-library-opens-digital-bookshelves-to-local-students/,2021-04-01T16:04:03-07:00,"
Thousands of local students in 19 schools and districts have a whole new world of digital and audio books to read and listen to, thanks to the County Library — and they won’t even need a library card.
The County Library has signed on to make its thousands of digital and audio books available to “Sora,” an app used by many school districts for its students and libraries. Because of that, students at the schools and districts — using just their students IDs ­— can check out the County Library’s wider collection of age-appropriate digital materials.
County Library Director Migell Acosta said the collaboration will give students a lot more to read, whether it’s to borrow educational materials or books for their own personal reading pleasure.
“This collaboration aims to promote literacy and education,” Acosta said, “by providing a wide range of resources to students who don’t have a library card yet but could greatly benefit from the San Diego County Library’s vast collection. We are excited to open up our digital collection to young residents who couldn’t previously take advantage of it.”
The County Library already has a large digital following, offering e-books, audio books and e-magazines around the clock, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to its patrons who download the Libby app, which like the Sora app, is also made by the company OverDrive. In 2020, the County Library’s digital circulation increased 56% to more than 3.2 million books and materials.
County officials said school districts in the County’s service area that would like to give their students greater access should contact OverDrive to sign up for Sora.
The schools and districts that are part of the Library’s Sora partnership are:

Albert Einstein Academy Charter School K-8
Alpine Union School District K-8
Bonsall Unified School District K-12
Cajon Valley Union School District K-8
Cardiff School District K-6
Carlsbad Unified School District K-12
Epiphany Prep Charter School K-5
Fallbrook Union Elementary School District K-8
Grossmont Union High School District 9-12
Helix Charter High School 9-12
Jamul-Delzura Union School District K-8
King-Chavez Neighborhood of Schools K-12

528,All San Diegans 50 and Older Can Get COVID-19 Vaccine,"More San Diegans will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 now that the state and the County have expanded eligibility to include all people between 50 and 64 years of age, the first group in Phase 2.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/all-san-diegans-50-and-older-can-get-covid-19-vaccine/,2021-04-01T16:29:50-07:00,"
More San Diegans will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19 now that the state and the County have expanded eligibility to include all people between 50 and 64 years of age, the first group in Phase 2.
While more people now qualify for the COVID-19 vaccine, health officials are urging San Diegans to be patient since there is still a shortage of doses.
“We know some San Diegans are anxious to get vaccinated, but we’re asking people to be patient,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “As we get more vaccines, it will be easier to make an appointment and get vaccinated.”
Starting April 15, everyone between 16 and 50 years of age, the second group in Phase 2, will also qualify for the COVID-19 vaccine.
The state’s goal is to vaccinate 75% of people 16 and older to achieve herd immunity. That’s about 2.02 million San Diegans.
San Diegans wishing to get vaccinated can make an appointment by visiting www.vaccinationsuperstationsd.com. Those 65 and older can call 2-1-1 for help.
Free COVID-19 Testing at Black Churches
Free COVID-19 testing is now available at three churches in San Diego County through June 30.
A new partnership between the County, the Tabernacle Community Development Corporation and the African American Community Empowerment Council launched today to offer COVID-19 testing at Bethel AME, Bayview Baptist Church and Total Deliverance Worship Center.
While vaccine distribution is now underway, community-based testing remains a key strategy to reducing coronavirus transmission and mortality. Through this partnership, COVID-19 testing will be more accessible to vulnerable communities.
“The COVID-19 pandemic is still a very dangerous part of our life. That remains especially true for the African American community,” Wooten said at a news conference to announce the partnership. “Testing is one of the most important things we can do to get back faster to the things we love.”
County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten encourages San Diegans to continue getting tested for COVID-19.
Black churches are well-positioned to inform the community about the importance of COVID-19 testing and to provide a known, safe space for accessing testing. The goal is to test 150 people daily at each church testing location through June 30. For more information, visit www.aacec-cal.org.
Free COVID-19 testing is also available at many locations throughout the region. To find a walk-in site or schedule an appointment, visit coronavirus-sd.com/testing.

With Easter weekend ahead of us, the County Health and Human Services Agency wants to remind San Diegans to celebrate the holiday safely. While the COVID-19 case numbers remain well below the December and January highs, it is too soon to let your guard down and attend gatherings without certain precautions.
Unvaccinated San Diegans should continue to adhere to the current guidelines from the California Department of Public Health and keep gatherings small and short. Gatherings should include no more than three total households.
Attendees should wear a face covering when not eating and adhere to social distancing practices. While indoor gatherings are allowed, outdoor gatherings are recommended.
According to new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, those who are fully vaccinated can begin to relax restrictions and attend gatherings with other fully vaccinated people.
“While new CDC guidance states that it is safe for fully vaccinated people to gather indoors or outdoors without a face covering, we know that at this time only about one in five San Diegans age 16 and over are fully immunized,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “I encourage everyone to follow the best practices for their situation to celebrate this holiday safely and keep us on a path to getting back to all the activities we enjoy.”
Easter Testing and Vaccinations
Several County testing and vaccination sites will pause on Sunday for the Easter holiday. The following sites will remain open, with modified hours:

The no-appointment testing sites at Cal State San Marcos and Tubman Chavez Community Center will be open with condensed hours from 10 a.m. – 2 p.m.
The vaccination sites at the North Coastal Live Well Center, Lemon Grove Community Center and South Region Public Health Center will be open from 9:30 a.m. – 3:30 p.m.
The Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center and Borderview YMCA vaccine sites will be closed on Easter.

534,79th Assembly District Election Results – When to Expect Them,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time, even for a special election such as the 79th Assembly District Primary Election.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/79th-assembly-district-election-results-when-to-expect-them/,2021-04-06T09:30:27-07:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time, even for a special election such as the 79th Assembly District Primary Election.
So, what can you expect on election night?
The first set of results comes in shortly after 8 p.m. They include ballots that were mailed in, returned to mail ballot drop-off locations, or cast during early voting at the Registrar’s office prior to Election Day.
The Election Day precinct ballots come in after the polls close at 8 p.m. and must be driven in from 51 polling place locations across the 79th Assembly District.
Upon arrival, the ballots are scanned, and results will be periodically updated throughout the night until all of the precinct ballots have been counted. For the latest results on election night, you can follow the Registrar’s office on Twitter.
The final unofficial election night results may not come in until midnight and will only cover the ballots that could be counted immediately.
Here’s what will remain to be counted.
Mail ballots. The Registrar’s office mailed over 300,000 ballots for this election and a portion of those could be dropped off at the polls or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Plus, mail ballots sent right before or on April 6 have three days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots. People who missed the March 22 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day.
For each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter didn’t already cast a ballot.
However, the results must be certified on April 15, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.

535,County Initiative Selected as National TB Elimination Champion,The County’s Tuberculosis Elimination Initiative has been selected as a 2021 TB Elimination Champion by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-initiative-selected-as-national-tb-elimination-champion/,2021-04-06T10:31:49-07:00,"
The County’s Tuberculosis Elimination Initiative has been selected as a 2021 TB Elimination Champion by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The TB Elimination Initiative was one of 19 organizations or individuals recognized by the CDC throughout the United States.
“This is a great recognition and a great example of what can be accomplished when public and private entities work together to fight diseases such as tuberculosis,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This is a well-deserved recognition for all the staff in the County’s Tuberculosis Control Program.”
The CDC U.S. TB Elimination Champions project recognizes organizations and individuals who have made meaningful contributions to end TB in their communities, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
The County’s Tuberculosis Elimination Initiative is being recognized for the region’s coordinated efforts to establish public-private partnerships to build a TB elimination framework that serves the County’s diverse population. The Initiative involves multiple sectors and communities impacted by TB.
“We are honored to receive this formal CDC recognition and want to thank our 35 local partners. Despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, stakeholders throughout the county collaborated with us to develop key recommendations and plan for implementation.” said Ankita S. Kadakia, M.D., chief medical director for Tuberculosis Control and Refugee Health at the County Health and Human Services Agency.  The county has also expanded access to its TB prevention programs through telehealth and is evaluating opportunities to leverage existing vaccination infrastructure to provide education and testing for people at highest risk for TB and latent TB infection.
More information about TB elimination and local statistics are available on the TB program website.

536,What’s Changing When County Moves to Orange Tier,"The County will move into the Orange Tier of the state’s COVID-19 prevention framework on Wednesday, April 7, further easing restrictions and allowing more indoor activities.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/whats-changing-when-county-moves-to-orange-tier/,2021-04-06T17:04:13-07:00,"
The County will move into the Orange Tier of the state’s COVID-19 prevention framework on Wednesday, April 7, further easing restrictions and allowing more indoor activities.
The region can move into the Orange Tier of the Blueprint for a Safer Economy because its case rate has been under 6 cases per every 100,000 residents for the last two weeks, after moving to the Red Tier on March 17. The move comes after the state raised the case rate threshold for counties to meet after meeting a goal to vaccinate more than 4 million Californians who live in areas with the least healthy community conditions.
Now, to qualify for the Orange Tier, a region must have a case rate between 2 and 5.9 case per every 100,000 residents. The County’s case rate is now 5.8 cases per every 100,000 residents.
“We have made significant progress in lowering our local case rate,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diegans should enjoy the benefits while continuing to take appropriate measures to protect themselves and others, especially washing their hands, wearing a mask, watching their distance and, when it’s their turn, getting vaccinated.”
Here are some of the activities now allowed under the Orange Tier:

Restaurants: Indoor seating increases to 50% capacity or 200 people maximum. The 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew is also ending.
Gyms and Fitness Centers: 25% capacity indoors; indoor pools can open.
Wineries and Breweries: 25% or 100 people indoors maximum
Movie Theaters: 50% or 200 people maximum.
Museums, Zoos and Aquariums: 50% capacity for indoor activities.
Places of Worship: 50% capacity indoor activities.
Bars with no food service: Open outdoors with modifications.
All retail: No capacity limits.

Many other restrictions will end April 15. You can see a complete list here. Also, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced today that if current trends continue, the tier system California has been using will disappear June 15, allowing for the complete reopening of the state’s economy.
Board Expands Rental Assistance, Great Plates Programs
The County Board of Supervisors today acted after receiving its bi-weekly COVID-19 update to help people who have been negatively impacted by the pandemic. The actions include:

Establish appropriations of $107 million for implementation of the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, which helps eligible households in qualifying areas who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Establish appropriations of $80 million for the Great Plates Delivered program, which delivers meals to older adults and people with disabilities who meet eligibility criteria.
Accept $124 million in funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, directed through the state, to expand the County public health laboratory’s capacity.

542,National Volunteer Month: County CERT Members Remain Active during Pandemic,"The month of April is designated as National Volunteer Month, and while COVID-19 has limited many volunteer programs in the county, the San Diego County Fire Protection District’s Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program has remained active throughout the pandemic.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/national-volunteer-month-county-cert-members-remain-active-during-pandemic/,2021-04-12T13:32:14-07:00,"
The month of April is designated as National Volunteer Month, and while COVID-19 has limited many volunteer programs in the county, the San Diego County Fire Protection District’s Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) program has remained active throughout the pandemic.
The CERT program is one of the county’s key community risk reduction initiatives. Volunteers train on a regular basis to be able to assist fellow residents in basic disaster response and recovery efforts.
Members of several CERTs from across the county combined forces through a mutual aid plan to support residents over the past year helping to distribute food, provide administrative assistance at COVID-19 testing and vaccination sites, and supporting fire evacuation efforts.
According to Teresa Greenhalgh, the county’s CERT coordinator, while the local CERT mutual aid plan has been in place since 2012, it had not been utilized until the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Following county guidelines in regard to underlying health conditions and those ages 65 and above, a large portion of each CERT programs’ members could not work these events,” said Greenhalgh. “Without implementing CERT mutual aid, many of the programs would not have been able to deploy their teams due to the few available members who could volunteer.”
Greenhalgh said COVID response was not the only mission of CERT volunteers last year, who also assisted in a more traditional role supporting the Red Cross at temporary evacuation points for the Valley Fire last September.
“CERT members are initially shelter trained to support the American Red Cross in San Diego but did have to complete a virtual training on supporting temporary evacuation points,” said Greenhalgh. “This training was completed by local CERT members just days before the Valley Fire started.”
Members of the CERT program said that while COVID presented some challenges in 2020, the cooperative spirit of the participants made it a worthwhile volunteer effort.
“Working the COVID-19 Operation Collaboration vaccination site has been a great experience,” said Kathy Rupert, a County Fire CERT member. “It is really rewarding as the people come thru and they are so excited to be getting vaccinated. It feels good to be helping the community.”
County residents interested in joining a CERT should contact their local CERT Manager, who can be found on the county’s CERT information website. Additional information and program information is also available by contacting Greenhalgh via telephone at (619) 857-8050, or via email at Teresa.greenhalgh@sdcounty.ca.gov

544,County Pauses Use of Johnson & Johnson Vaccine in San Diego,The County is following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration and pausing the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after a rare type of blood clot was reported in six recently vaccinated women in the United States.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-pauses-use-of-johnson-johnson-vaccine-in-san-diego/,2021-04-13T15:56:42-07:00,"
The County is following the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration and pausing the use of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine after a rare type of blood clot was reported in six recently vaccinated women in the United States.
“The health and safety of San Diego County residents is our number one priority, and, in an abundance of caution, we are pausing use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine while state and national authorities thoroughly investigate these reports,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
The CDC and FDA reported that six women ages 18 to 48 who suffered a rare and severe type of blood clot, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), in combination with low levels of blood platelets (thrombocytopenia) within two weeks after getting the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
CVST is a form of blood clot that typically occurs in younger patients, usually under 50 years old and predominantly women. According to the CDC, CVST occurs 5–16 people per 1 million people per year in the United States.
According to the CDC, about 6.85 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine have been administered in the U.S.
In San Diego County, about 58,000 San Diegans have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and no known severe adverse effects have been reported in the region.
“The cases that prompted the pause appeared in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The fact that the six cases of a rare condition were identified after recent vaccination followed by a pause while further investigations occur is a sign that the system works,” Wooten said.
COVID-19 vaccines were evaluated in tens of thousands of participants in clinical trials. The vaccines met FDA’s rigorous scientific standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality needed to support emergency use authorization.
COVID-19 vaccines have been undergoing the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history.
The CDC and FDA use VAERS to collect reports from health care professionals, vaccine manufacturers and the public of adverse events that happen after vaccination. Reports of adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected or have unusual patterns are followed up with specific studies. The CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday, April 14.
For San Diegans who got the vaccine more than a month ago, the risk to them is very low at this time. For San Diegans who recently got the vaccine—within the last few weeks—they should be aware of any symptoms.
If you have received the vaccine and develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath, you should contact your health care provider and seek immediate medical treatment.
“San Diegans should continue to get vaccinated with a Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, which are now being used at the clinics that offered the Johnson and Johnson vaccine,” Wooten said.
The CDC is asking health care providers to report adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

Here is today’s COVID-19 update from the County Health and Human Services Agency with data through April 12.
Vaccination Progress:

Almost 2.28 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and about 2.12 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.
Of those vaccinated to date, more than 745,000 County residents, or 27.7% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.
Overall, nearly 1.2 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That’s 44.3% of those eligible.
Those who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is currently on hold in the County due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.
The difference between doses delivered and those used in a vaccination represents approximately what is expected to be administered in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.
More information about vaccine distribution can be found on the County’s vaccination dashboard. For details on groups currently eligible and vaccination opportunities, visit www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.

State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.0 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 13) and this data point places the region in the Red Tier or Tier 2. (The County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 following recent guidance from the state.)
The California Department of Public Health recently advised that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region and the County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.
Currently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.5%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.

546,COVID-19 Vaccine to Open to Everyone 16 and Older,"Starting April 15, everyone 16 and older will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-vaccine-to-open-to-everyone-16-and-older/,2021-04-14T16:56:33-07:00,"
Starting April 15, everyone 16 and older will be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19.
“Every San Diegan who qualifies for the vaccine can now get vaccinated,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccine is the best protection we have against COVID-19. Get your shot as soon as you can.”
Currently, only the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are available in the region. Use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been paused while it is reviewed following recent safety concerns.
New Guidance for Gatherings
Also going into effect April 15 is new guidance on gatherings, private and indoor live events, and performances.
In the Orange Tier, which the County is currently in, outdoor activities of up to 50 people are now permitted. Indoor gatherings are strongly discouraged but are allowed with modifications and if they do not exceed 25 people.
Private outdoor events are permitted for up to 100 people; 300 persons if all guests show proof of a recent COVID-19 test or full vaccination. A maximum of 150 are allowed at an indoor event if everyone has been tested or shows proof of complete vaccination.
Only people living in the state are permitted to attend indoor, seated, live event or performances. For venues with a capacity of up to 1,500, a maximum of 15% or 200 people can attend; 35% if all guests have tested negative or have been fully vaccinated for COVID-19.
A complete list of activities that can take place under the different tiers and additional gathering guidance can be found here.
Vaccination Progress:

Almost 2.28 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and about 2.16 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.

551,COVID-19 Treatment Option Added in South Bay,"San Diegans now have an additional option to access a treatment that significantly reduces symptoms for COVID-19 patients, with the opening of a Monoclonal Antibody Treatment Center (MARC) in Chula Vista today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-treatment-option-added-in-south-bay/,2021-04-19T16:21:32-07:00,"
San Diegans now have an additional option to access a treatment that significantly reduces symptoms for COVID-19 patients, with the opening of a Monoclonal Antibody Treatment Center (MARC) in Chula Vista today.
The treatment is available at no cost regardless of health insurance or immigration status, and a doctor’s referral is not required. San Diego County and San Ysidro Health worked with federal, state and community partners to open the new facility inside the former Chula Vista Fire Station #5. This is the second MARC facility in the county.
The FDA has authorized the use of combination monoclonal antibody therapies to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight viruses. The combination therapy has proven to significantly reduce hospital visits and death in COVID-19 positive patients, if administered within 10 days of the onset of symptoms. It can also help people get back to work and back to their lives without the lingering symptoms of COVID-19.
In early February, Palomar Medical Center Downtown’s MARC became the first in the county to be dedicated to this treatment model. The intravenous treatment takes less than an hour and is for people who are at high risk for serious complications from COVID-19. Patients or providers can call (619) 685-2500 to schedule an appointment at either site. The MARC at San Ysidro Health is open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., seven days a week.

The goal is to fully vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 65.3% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 42% are fully vaccinated.
Those who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which is currently on hold in the County due to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Food and Drug Administration, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.
The difference between doses shipped and the number of vaccinations administered represents approximately what is expected to be used in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.

State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.1 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 20).
The County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state’s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health indicates that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.
Currently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.4%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.

557,Infant Immunizations Dropped During COVID-19 Pandemic,The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has yielded a troubling result: a drop in routine childhood vaccinations.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/infant-immunizations-dropped-during-covid-19-pandemic/,2021-04-23T11:15:48-07:00,"
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has yielded another troubling result: a drop in routine childhood vaccinations.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report published nearly a year ago revealed the number of children receiving routine vaccines dropped immediately after the United States declared a national emergency due to the coronavirus. The trend continued during the pandemic because of families staying at home.
April 24-May 1 is National Infant Immunization Week, and the County Health and Human Services Agency is urging parents to make sure their children are vaccinated against all vaccine-preventable diseases.
“Vaccines help to prevent disease outbreaks,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Parents should make sure their children have all the recommended vaccines to protect them.”
Vaccines reduce disease, disability and death from a variety of infectious diseases.
The CDC recommends that children get vaccinated against 16 diseases.
Vaccine-preventable diseases are not that common in the United States thanks to vaccinations. However, these diseases continue to sicken people around the world, and cases of diseases like mumps, measles and pertussis, also called whooping cough, can and do happen in San Diego County.
Seasonal influenza is more common and requires a new vaccine each year and is recommended for all children 6 months and older.
According to the CDC, when children get vaccinated, an estimated 381 million illnesses, 24.5 million hospitalizations, and 855,000 deaths are prevented.
“Vaccinations and doctor visits are essential to keep children healthy,” Wooten said.
In addition to infant immunizations, children need the following:

Children 4 to 6 years of age are due for boosters of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis), chickenpox, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and polio
Preteens and teens need a Tdap booster shot to protect against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough

Parents can obtain the vaccines for their children through their regular medical provider. People with no medical insurance can get vaccinated at a County Public Health Center at no cost. Local retail pharmacies also offer some vaccinations for a fee.
For more information about vaccines, National Infant Immunization Week, or back-to-school vaccine requirements, visit the Health and Human Services Agency Immunization Unit  website at www.sandiegocounty.gov/iz or call (866) 358-2966.

558,VIDEO: Flag Raising Ceremony Honors Abused and Neglected Children,"A special flag is flying over the Polinsky Children’s Center to honor children who have died due to abuse, violence and neglect. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flag-raising-ceremony-honors-abused-and-neglected-children/,2021-04-23T17:08:22-07:00,"
A special flag is flying over the Polinsky Children’s Center to honor children who have died due to abuse, violence and neglect.
Each year, more than three million cases of child abuse are reported in the U.S. and more than 1,700 children die as a result of abuse and neglect. That’s an average of five children per day and the numbers have steadily increased over the last two decades.
To raise awareness about this issue, the County’s Polinsky Children’s Center, which provides temporary emergency shelter to children who must be separated from their families for their own safety, hosted a Children’s Memorial Day ceremony Friday morning. Attendees honored the victims of child abuse and neglect with a moment of silence.
The annual flag raising event is part of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, which provides the community with tools that help recognize the warning signs of abuse and neglect.
“Everyone has a role to play in making sure our community is a safe place for children to thrive,” said Kimberly Giardina, Child Welfare Services director. “Even small gestures can make a big difference, including words of encouragement to a struggling parent or offering empathy and support instead of judgment.”
If you have reason to believe a child you know is experiencing abuse or neglect, contact the County’s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or (800) 344-6000. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego, or check this website for a variety of resources related to child abuse prevention.

The County is resuming vaccinations with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after the California Department of Public Health gave the green light to do so over the weekend.
Vaccinations with Johnson & Johnson were temporarily paused earlier this month while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration studied adverse reactions in a small number of recipients. The FDA concluded April 23 that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh its risks and approved it for emergency use. Following the subsequent findings of the Western States Scientific Safety Review Workgroup, CDPH approved the vaccine’s usage.
Women under the age of 50 should be aware of the rare but increased risk of blood clots after vaccination with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and talk to their medical providers about other options if they have concerns about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
The County of San Diego currently has about 12,000 doses of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine available and will offer them at mobile vaccination sites and walk-up vaccine pods. The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine will also be used to vaccinate homebound individuals and agricultural workers who are often more difficult to reach for a second dose.
Available Vaccine Appointments
Thanks to Johnson & Johnson vaccinations resuming and a steady supply of incoming vaccine shipments, vaccination sites across the County currently have appointments available for the coming days. A new vaccination location, the Linda Vista Vaccine Site at the University of San Diego, opens tomorrow. The site will be open from 9 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.
You can research appointment times and locations at www.vaccinationsuperstation.com.
Vaccine recipients will be informed during sign-up which vaccine they will receive, which is standard practice. Those signing up for appointments on MyTurn can see which of the three available vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna or Pfizer, will be offered to them.
Vaccination Progress:

Over 2.72 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and more than 2.53 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.
Overall, close to 1.39 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That’s 51.7% of those eligible.
Of those vaccinated to date, over 935,000 County residents, or 34.8% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.
The goal is to fully vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 68.9% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 46.4% are fully vaccinated.

562,Earthquake Preparedness Month Reminds Residents: “Don’t Get Caught Off Guard”,"April is Earthquake Preparedness Month in California, and the County of San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) and California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) are reminding residents to “not get caught off guard” and have a plan for how to protect themselves in the event of an earthquake.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/earthquake-preparedness-month-reminds-residents-dont-get-caught-off-guard/,2021-04-28T12:31:57-07:00,"
April is Earthquake Preparedness Month in California, and the County of San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services (OES) and California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) are reminding residents to “not get caught off guard” and have a plan for how to protect themselves in the event of an earthquake.
San Diego County is home to three major active faults: the Rose Canyon Fault (which runs along the coast, through downtown, Old Town and La Jolla), and the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults, which run through the northern and eastern areas of the county. Earthquakes along these faults could produce damaging earthquakes that may disrupt roadways, transportation, and services like water, gas, and phone communication for weeks or months. Coastal areas are also at risk for tsunamis.
As part of the state’s 2021 “Don’t Get Caught Off Guard” campaign, OES and Cal OES officials are encouraging residents to take the time to know their risks, update their emergency plan, register for local emergency alerts, and download an earthquake early warning app.
The County’s Office of Emergency Services will launch earthquake early warning technology, ShakeReadySD, powered by ShakeAlert®, in the SD Emergency app this July. When enabled, ShakeReadySD is designed to alert iPhone and Android users seconds before a magnitude 4.5 or higher earthquake with moderate to strong shaking is expected in your area so you can take the right actions quickly to protect yourself.
In the meantime, Californians can download the state’s no-cost MyShake App to their iPhone and Android. Managed by Cal OES, the MyShake app is part of the Earthquake Warning California system that similarly uses a network of ground motion sensors located across the state to alert users through the app, Android Alerts, and the Wireless Emergency Alert system to “Drop, Cover and Hold On” seconds before significant earthquake with the criteria mentioned above arrives.
If you live in or travel to areas that could be impacted by an earthquake, preparation is vital, as these events can strike suddenly, at any time, with little warning. To discover your level of risk for earthquakes and the specific steps you should take to prepare, visit the Know Your Hazards map tool. For more information about hazards throughout California, visit Cal OES’ My Hazards map.
To register for AlertSanDiego, the county’s regional emergency mass notification system, and to learn about the steps you can take to prepare for earthquakes and other disasters, visit ReadySanDiego.org. More information on earthquake early warning, visit ShakeAlert.org.

563,Two Deer Mice Test Positive for Hantavirus,"Two deer mice collected during routine vector surveillance activities in Boulevard have tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/two-deer-mice-test-positive-for-hantavirus/,2021-04-28T16:05:28-07:00,"
Two deer mice collected during routine vector surveillance activities in Boulevard have tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.
While this is the first detection of hantavirus in the region this year, the virus is not uncommon in San Diego County. In 2020, 25 rodents collected in routine monitoring by County Vector Control tested positive for hantavirus.
There is no cure or vaccine for hantavirus and it can potentially cause deadly infections in people. People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed it in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries and is stirred into the air where people can breathe it in.
However, people are rarely exposed to hantavirus because the main carriers are wild rodents that prefer to live in the wild away from people.
“If you find rodents in or near your home, do not touch the animals and refrain from sweeping up or vacuuming up after them,” said Amy Harbert, director of the Department of Environmental Health and Quality. “Instead, use a wet-cleaning method to keep from breathing in the virus and getting sick.”
Recommended wet cleaning methods include the use of bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags.
Here are additional tips that can help people prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, as well as details about using wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

For more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality  (DEHQ) at (858) 694-2888 or visit the DEHQ hantavirus web page.

The state has adopted the new CDC mask guidelines and the County is also easing the same restrictions in the region.
“Outdoor activities are deemed the safest, especially for people who are fully vaccinated,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “In addition to protecting yourself and others from COVID-19, getting vaccinated allows you to be in public, dine outdoor with friends and attend small gatherings without having to wear a mask.”
Masks are still necessary in crowded outdoor events and indoor activities, whether you’re vaccinated or not.
Vaccination Progress:

Almost 2.96 million COVID-19 vaccine doses have been delivered to the region, and nearly 2.69 million have been logged as administered. This number includes both County residents and those who work in San Diego County.
Overall, close to 1.45 million County residents have received at least one shot of the two-dose vaccine. That’s 53.8% of those eligible.
Of those vaccinated to date, over 1 million County residents, or 37.4% of San Diegans 16 and older, are fully immunized.
The goal is to fully vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 16 and older or 2,017,011 people. To date, 71.8% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 49.9% are fully vaccinated.
Veterans Affairs doses received and administered, as well as people vaccinated and fully vaccinated, are now included in the numbers and percentages above.
Those who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which was approved for emergency use by the FDA April 23, 2021 following a pause to study adverse reactions in a small number of recipients, are being added to the total of fully vaccinated San Diegans.
The difference between doses shipped and the number of vaccinations administered represents approximately what is expected to be used in the next seven days and doses still to be entered in the record system.

State Metrics:

San Diego County’s state-calculated, adjusted case rate is currently 6.2 cases per 100,000 residents (as of April 27).
The County remains in the Orange Tier or Tier 3 under the state’s new guidance. The California Department of Public Health indicates that unless there are extenuating circumstances, such as low rate of vaccine uptake, a county will only move to a more restrictive tier if hospitalizations are increasing significantly among vulnerable individuals, especially among vaccinated individuals, and both testing positivity and adjusted case rates show a concerning increase in transmission. This is currently not the case in the region.
Currently, the testing positivity percentage is 2.3%, placing the County in Tier 3 or the Orange Tier.
The County’s health equity metric, which looks at the testing positivity for areas with the lowest healthy conditions, is 3.0% and is also in the Orange Tier or Tier 3.
CDPH assesses counties on a weekly basis. The next report is scheduled for Tuesday, May 4.

565,County Opens Unique Campground and Newest Bike Park in South Bay,"County and other officials held opening events Wednesday for two eagerly awaited projects: the new Tijuana River Valley Regional Park Campground and the Otay Valley Regional Park’s Bike Park, named for the district’s former County Supervisor Greg Cox.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-opens-unique-campground-and-newest-bike-park-in-south-bay/,2021-04-28T17:52:07-07:00,"
County and other officials held opening events Wednesday for two eagerly awaited projects: the new Tijuana River Valley Regional Park Campground and the Otay Valley Regional Park’s Bike Park, named for the district’s former County Supervisor Greg Cox.
The events were attended by Vice Chair Nora Vargas, who represents the first supervisorial district where the projects are located, Chula Vista Mayor Mary Casillas Salas and Cox, who was the district’s County supervisor for 25 years and Chula Vista’s mayor for nine years.
“We are excited for the new recreation opportunities these two new parks are bringing not only to the South County but to all San Diego County,” said Vargas. “We must work together to continue to open new public spaces, along with more inclusive play spaces like the Bike Park, and to balance that growth with the necessary protections of our land and local resources.”
The projects are about seven miles, or 15 minutes’ drive, apart from one another in South County and will provide all County residents with two new recreational destinations.
The $14.3 million, 79-acre Tijuana River Valley Regional Park Campground offers scenic views of the valley, access to more than 20 miles of trails and 51 primitive campsites, including 16 for tents, five for equestrian campers, 30 multi-use sites that can accommodate trailers, and 10 yurts.
The campground is across from 1942 Monument Road and features County Parks’ only yurts — modern versions of ancient, round, tent-like, covered camping spaces, with doors, windows, bed frames and space for four to 10 people. Each ADA-accessible yurt site has a picnic table, fire ring and a parking spot, with the option to add a second car. Primitive campsites do not offer hookups, power or water at each site.
The campground also has an amphitheater, a nature education center and nature play equipment made of natural objects for children, and restrooms and showers.
The campsite is taking reservations for the regular sites and yurts will be available starting this weekend. Camping can be booked for $24 for tent, equestrian and multi-use sites, plus a $5 reservation fee. Reservation fees for the yurts are $60 for the smaller ones and $90 for the larger ones.
The Greg Cox Bike Park is the second bike skills park the County has built and it will be operated by the city of Chula Vista from 8 a.m. to sunset. The County’s first bike park, the popular Sweetwater Bike Park, opened to rave reviews in January 2020. Like Sweetwater, the Greg Cox Bike Park was built to create exercise and fun for riders of all ages and is free for users. The 3.2-acre, $1.05 million park located just beyond 253 Rancho Drive features beginner and intermediate bike trails, a beginner’s zone, a jump line and what County officials say is California’s largest modular pump track — a bicycle course of rollers, banked turns and other features that let bikers ride without pedaling.
Cox was thanked at the opening ceremony for his efforts and said he was “honored with the recognition and the naming,” but said it’s been a collaborative effort among three jurisdictions.
“It’s going to bring a lot of kids out and give them the skills they need to get outside and get some exercise and become healthier,” said Cox. “So, it’s a real joy to see and it’s even more exciting to see the kids out here – and adults, using this facility.”
The bike park was immediately opened to the public at the end of Wednesday’s ribbon-cutting, which was performed by riders bicycling through a large ceremonial ribbon.
“Both of these projects have been a labor of love for County Parks,” said Brian Albright, director for the County of San Diego Department of Parks and Recreation. “Research shows that spending time outdoors and in nature is good for you. We hope our parks will inspire more people to be active and build social connections – two things that seem especially vital, given the past year, for our physical, emotional and mental well-being.”

570,Southern Fire Reminds Residents to Take Action Before Fire Strikes,The Southern Fire that forced evacuations in the Anza Borrego Desert over the weekend came at the start of “Wildfire Preparedness Week” and underscores the messages of the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services and CAL Fire/San Diego County Fire to take hands-on action to be ready for wildfires.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/southern-fire-reminds-residents-to-take-action-before-fire-strikes/,2021-05-03T15:11:44-07:00,"
The Southern Fire that forced evacuations in the Anza Borrego Desert over the weekend came at the start of “Wildfire Preparedness Week” and underscores the messages of the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services and CAL Fire/San Diego County Fire to take hands-on action to be ready for wildfires.
The 2020 fire season broke numerous records, and California experienced six of the largest and most destructive wildfires in state history. More than 4 million acres burned across the state, which was double the previous record set in 2008.
With continued dry conditions and temperatures above normal for this time of year, the upcoming 2021 wildfire season could be even more catastrophic and devastating than last year. San Diego County residents can play an important role in preparing for and preventing wildfires, and now is the time to ensure there is adequate defensible space around homes and buildings, to make homes more fire-resistant and to have a personal disaster plan.
This is especially important since many county residents live in high-risk fire zones. Fire prevention tools such as protective fuel breaks, fire-resistant landscaping, and home hardening for their safety and survival. These tools work together to build more fire-resilient communities.
To protect their home during a fire, the single most important thing a person can do is to create defensible space around their home; 100 feet is required by state law. It is important to remember that any clearance work involving any type of mower or power equipment should only be done during non-critical fire conditions because it can actually spark a fire.
Residents who are physically and financially unable to create and maintain defensible space around their home may be able to receive assistance through the County’s Defensible Space Assistance Program.
Individuals and families are also urged to have an emergency plan and practice it regularly so it’s not unfamiliar in a high-stress situation like a fast-approaching wildfire. This plan should include identified evacuation routes and designated meeting locations outside of your home and neighborhood, and a list of local and out-of-area emergency contacts.  Owners of large animals such as horses or livestock should also have an evacuation plan and know when to leave in an emergency.
It’s also important to prepare an emergency kit in advance with important supplies, including copies of important documents, photos, non-perishable foods, water, extra clothes, medications and medical equipment, phone chargers, extra batteries, and supplies for pets.
Lastly, residents also encouraged to register their cell phones on AlertSanDiego, the county’s emergency notification system and download the SD Emergency App at no cost. An emergency plan template is available in English, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese, Farsi, French, Korean, Somali, and in English and Spanish an audio versions.
To learn more about how to prepare before a fire and what to do during a fire situation, visit ReadySanDiego.org and ReadyforWildfire.org.

574,Probation Officers Save Life of Local Man with Overdose Antidote,"A group of San Diego County probation officers helped to save a life last week during a routine home visit, administering two doses of the drug naloxone to a 38-year-old local man who was suffering from a suspected opioid overdose.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/probation-officers-save-life-of-local-man-with-overdose-antidote/,2021-05-05T13:08:42-07:00,"
A group of San Diego County probation officers helped to save a life last week during a routine home visit, administering two doses of the drug naloxone to a 38-year-old local man who was suffering from a suspected opioid overdose.
Both opioid abuse and opioid-related drug overdoses have been steadily on the rise in the county for the past few years, including a growing trend of fentanyl-laced methamphetamine, heroin, ecstasy, and other recreational drugs identified by law enforcement.
Denise Huffhines, Deputy Chief of Adult Reintegration and Community Supervision services, said all field service officers have been carrying naloxone since 2019 and receive regular training on its proper use, but this is the first time one of their officers has administered it to save a life.
“Our officers were conducting a home visit on a client who had recently tested positive for methamphetamine,” said Huffhines. “During the contact, the client began to show signs of being under the influence and suddenly became unconscious.”
Huffhines said officers requested medical assistance and tried to wake the client who was not responding.  Suspecting that the client was overdosing, she said officers administered one dose of Narcan (naloxone) and the client briefly responded before becoming unconscious again.  
“Our officers administered a second dose of Narcan, and the client subsequently responded and became alert,” said Huffhines. “The client was then transported to a local hospital by paramedics.”
Huffhines said during a subsequent search of the client’s possessions, a replica handgun, stun-device, pills and drug paraphernalia were found.  While no fentanyl was found at the location, officers said they suspected that the overdose may have been related to pills found in the client’s possession.
Liza Enjambre, a supervising probation officer with the county, was the senior officer on the scene during the incident. She credited the entire team of officers and an additional training unit that just happened to be with them that night for being able to handle the situation.
“They knew exactly what to do in this type of situation to help save a life,” said Enjambre. “This included administering the drug and keeping the man awake and alert until medical assistance arrived on the scene.”
Enjambre said probation officers having access to naloxone and knowing how to administer it is important due to the recent rise in people struggling with opioid addiction and the presence of fentanyl in many street drugs.
“We went through this training initially over two years ago,” said Enjambre. “In my job, I always do mental rehearsals and I knew that one day I would have to use it. The training helped tremendously for both me and my team.”
While this was the first time probation officers have administered naloxone since the policy was implemented in 2018 and grant funding made the drug available to the department in 2019, the San Diego Sheriff’s Department first began carrying the drug in 2014. Deputies in the Law Enforcement Services Bureau used it a total of 47 times in 2020. Detention Bureau deputies also used naloxone an additional 75 times, making the department’s total reported use at 122 incidents for 2020.
Ruben Leyva, Assistant Chief Probation Officer, said he was encouraged to see officers have success with a tool that aids their ability to serve vulnerable populations who may be struggling with addiction.
“Oftentimes unseen, our officers continually do great work in support of our clients and the community,” said Leyva. “As law enforcement personnel who often come into contact with people at risk for opioid overdoses, having naloxone readily available and knowing how to use it can help save lives.”

577,"County Budget Reflects Residents’ Needs, Builds Framework for Future","With a new budget that responds to voices in the community and follows a Framework for the Future that fundamentally changes our operations, the Chief Administrative Officer’s recommended budget was released today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-budget-reflects-residents-needs-builds-framework-for-future/,2021-05-06T13:00:21-07:00,"
With a new budget that responds to voices in the community and follows a Framework for the Future that fundamentally changes our operations, the Chief Administrative Officer’s recommended budget was released today.
It calls for $7.03 billion in fiscal year 2021-22 spending, an increase of 7.3% and a net increase of 660 additional staff years, excluding staff from the Air Pollution Control District which became an independent agency on March 1.
Investments in both funding and staff are designed to make an impact in these key areas:
Justice System Reform
This budget prioritizes justice system reform, focusing on preventive over punitive measures and expanded reentry support for those who are involved in the justice system to reduce recidivism and result in more positive outcomes.
Medical care and access to mental health services will be expanded throughout the jail system with 141 additional staff, and $10 million will expand the Mobile Crisis Response Team program used as an alternative to dispatching law enforcement for individuals in crisis.
The County is also investing $75 million for phase two of the new Youth Transition Campus to move away from a traditional correctional, punitive model that looks, feels, and operates like a jail to one that fosters a framework for positive youth development that is shown to support improved well-being and outcomes.
Racial Justice
The newly formed Office of Equity and Racial Justice and the Human Relations Commission are working hand in hand with the community to create systemic change inside and outside of County government to ensure positive human relations and respect for everyone in the region.
Within the County, the goal is to create a culture of equity, belonging and racial justice. Community voices and employees will look at County operations through an equity and racial justice lens for disparities. Their feedback and the enhanced use of data analysis will help root out systemic racism.
The new budget will also support new projects from the Office of Equity and Racial Justice such as the initiative designed to Uplift Boys and Men of Color.
Behavioral Health
The budget also prioritizes support for behavioral health, dedicating almost $813 million overall, including increases to redesign and enhance programs and services. This also includes mobile outreach for clients reluctant to engage in traditional settings, lowering staff-to-client ratios, enhancing crisis stabilization services, and helping ensure behavioral health clients are placed at the correct level of care possibly reducing emergency room use.
The budget also funds $3.2 million for 23 nurses supporting the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, which provides critical crisis stabilization and inpatient behavioral health services to some of San Diego County’s most vulnerable residents, as well as additional mental health support for adults and youth involved in the justice system.
Health Equity
The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for health equity. The recommended budget invests $226.9 million toward continued response to COVID-19 and includes diversely targeted outreach for hard-hit neighborhoods and other vulnerable populations, continued testing, treatment and tracing efforts, and meals to at-risk seniors. The budget also increases funding to help every person live the healthiest life possible. This includes 166 additional positions to meet increased demand for safety net services including the CalFresh and Medi-Cal programs, and provides extra staffing for Adult Protective Services, In-Home Supportive Services and Child Welfare Services.
Economic Opportunity
The new budget along with an anticipated allocation of $650 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding is focused on economic recovery. The funding will provide senior and youth services, small business stimulus funds, permit fee waivers for the events industry, expanded broadband access, infrastructure, child care subsidies, food assistance and mental health services.
Homelessness
The budget calls for new ways to make progress on this critical issue, including the creation of a Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities to streamline operations that are spread across several County agencies. The budget also includes 19 new positions and a $2.5 million increase for Community Care Coordination programs to support veterans, youth and high-need individuals with housing and other assistance. Separately, the Board of Supervisors has created a framework for the approximately $650 million to be received through the American Rescue Plan Act with $85 million currently earmarked for services to support those who are homeless.
Housing Accessibility and Affordability
The federal allocation of $107 million will continue offering rental assistance through the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. The budget also includes increased funding for the CalWORKs Housing Support program to help families in need find and retain permanent housing and $2.7 million to encourage development of Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs, by waiving permit and impact fees and offering pre-approved plans to save time and cost.
Environmental Protection
The budget calls for $104.5 million for environmental protection and includes reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, planting trees, acquiring at least 500 acres of land for open space, protecting water quality and agriculture, and diverting waste from landfills. Funding will also broaden the Environmental Justice Element in the County’s General Plan to reduce pollution exposure and promote public facilities, food access, safe and sanitary homes, and physical activities in underserved communities.
Government Transparency
The budget provides resources to support a new subcommittee to enhance accessibility and open government within County operations that includes engaging the public in the County budget and Board of Supervisors meetings. The subcommittee will also review and assess a Public Records Act portal, accessing archived public records and the County’s email retention policy.
Community Investments
The budget calls for $279.6 million in capital projects to improve communities throughout the region. This includes a new Otay Mesa Fire Station, new Casa De Oro Library and Julian Library Community Room, and more than $70 million for new parks, trails and recreational areas to enjoy the outdoors and preserve open space.
Budget Timeline and How to Comment
The public can watch budget presentations by several County departments to the Board of Supervisors on Wednesday, May 26 and Thursday, May 27.
Budget hearings will begin at 9 a.m. on Monday, June 14. An evening hearing will take place at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 16.

In recognition of National Nurses Month, the County would like to celebrate its 892 nurses and thank them for their commitment and dedication to delivering exceptional healthcare to the region.
Health and Human Services Agency nurses provide individualized care that is timely, effective, and equitable, treating some of the most vulnerable populations in the community. They promote health and prevent disease in a diverse range of specialty areas.
This year, HHSA nurses have been the public-facing vanguard of the COVID-19 pandemic response, reminding us all how critical they are during an emergency. Public health nurses, staff nurses, licensed vocational nurses, social service aides and nurse practitioners: all have been essential in nearly every part of the pandemic response. They have been instrumental in testing, vaccinations, case investigations, homeless outreach and providing support to COVID positive individuals and families.
Now, more than at any moment in our lifetimes, the integrity, expertise and strengths of County nurses is making a difference and saving lives.

San Diego County officials said Wednesday that they fully expect 12-to-15 year old youths to be able to start getting vaccinated Thursday with Pfizer vaccines, pending the expected approval Wednesday night by the Western States Scientific Safety Review and California Department of Public Health.
County officials also reported just 94 new COVID-19 cases, the first time new cases dipped below 100 in nearly a year. It marked the lowest number of new cases since the County reported 73 cases on May 31, 2020.
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, the advisory committee to the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approved the Pfizer vaccine for 12-to-15 year old youths Wednesday afternoon, clearing the way for the Western States Scientific Safety Review to review and approve it as well.
County officials said the County has access to enough Pfizer vaccine to provide vaccinations for all the 175,864 12-to-15 year olds in San Diego County.
Parents, and youth 12-15 years of age with parental approvals, can begin making appointments or walking into County clinics Thursday morning, or possibly late tonight, to receive shots. The My Turn online appointment system will not be updated until after the Western State’s working group issues its approval.  The County plans to post tonight information about how to schedule appointments and what types of documentation youths will need to get vaccinated on its COVID-19 web site (link).
County officials said people should not walk into the County’s mobile clinics without first confirming the location has the Pfizer vaccine, which is the only one approved so far for 12-to-15 year old youth. Most mobile clinics feature the J&J/Janssen vaccine.
“This is an exciting milestone in our efforts to help people get vaccinated,” said County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “Already, nearly half of our 16 and older population in San Diego County have become fully vaccinated. This is going to allow our 12-to-15 year old population to become protected as well and let them and their families feel safer.”
Vaccination Progress:

Doses delivered: Nearly 3.7 million.
Doses administered: Nearly 3.23 million.
Received at least one shot: Close to 1.75 million or 65.0% of San Diegans 16 and older.

586,Success Story: Sheriff’s Department Reentry Programs Key to Woman’s New Path in Life,"Everyone makes mistakes, and San Diego native Angela Carapia is no exception.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/success-story-sheriffs-department-reentry-programs-key-to-womans-new-path-in-life/,2021-05-13T08:45:43-07:00,"
Everyone makes mistakes, and San Diego native Angela Carapia is no exception.
She said her life began to spiral out of control in 2013 while being a single mother, preparing to send her son off to college, taking care of an ailing mother, attempting to reconnect with an absentee father, dealing with substance use, and trying to manage the day-to-day finances of the family. It was just too much.
She made a series of bad decisions around that time; before she knew it, she was at the Las Colinas Detention and Reentry Facility facing a possible sentence of 18 years. Her story could have stopped there, as it does for many men and women in the county who experience similar issues. Not Carapia.
Almost immediately after arriving at Las Colinas, Carapia said she decided the incarcerated life was not the way she wanted to live. She credits the multiple reentry programs offered by San Diego County Sheriff’s Department for putting her on a new path in life.
“It’s a very humbling experience, and these programs actually do help,” said Carapia. “They aren’t here to make you fall or trip you up like many people might think. They are here to actually help you get your life back on track and have a future for yourself.”
Carapia entered the Incentive-Based Housing program just a few weeks after arriving at Las Colinas. The program allows inmates more access to reentry programs if they agree to take part in psychosocial, education, and wellness classes.
After completing the housing program, Carapia took the opportunity to participate in one of the vocational programs offered at Las Colinas that helps to prepare women for reentry into society once their sentences are complete. Ms. Carapia completed nearly all the programs offered at the facility, ranging from the Beyond Anger and Violence program to working with The Old Globe theater, which she still does.
Bridget Wright, a supervisor with the Sheriff’s Reentry Services Division, said that Carapia’s performance in the Culinary Arts Program and interest in continuing in the field led to additional opportunities in food service.
“She was encouraged to complete the new Kitchens for Good Management Program, and she did,” said Wright. “She was actually awarded the OASIS award from instructors and staff at the Grossmont Adult Education School for being an outstanding student during her Kitchens for Good graduation last month.”
Wright said, “While the support and reentry programs are there, Ms. Carapia is doing all the hard work herself. She will now begin her 20-month apprenticeship working in restaurants, while continuing to prioritize her recovery and meeting the conditions of her mandatory supervision.”
Carapia is currently working as a cashier at Sombrero Mexican Food in the Grantville neighborhood, a local, family-owned restaurant chain. She said the skills she learned in the Culinary Arts Program will help her move up into other kitchen and restaurant management positions in the area.
“There were times when I wanted to throw in the towel, but I saw the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Carapia. “It wasn’t easy, but a lot of people are proud of me, and I’m proud of myself.”
For women leaving the justice system and returning to the community, Carapia highly recommends the reentry programs available. Her advice for others in similar situations in the justice system is simple. She tells them not to give up on themselves, no matter what the current circumstances may be because things get better.
“We all have battle scars from our past,” said Carapia. “These services are there to help you, and they really want you to succeed and not go back to being locked up.”
During the almost five years she spent behind bars at Las Colinas, Ms. Carapia said in addition to the reentry programs she also found comfort in a poem that makes its way around the facility, as well as other detention facilities in the U.S., called “God’s Hotel.”
“That poem is very inspirational to me,” said Ms. Carapia. “It says God put me there, even though it wasn’t my choice or his choice either, but it was a place where I could focus on myself.”
You can watch a video of Carapia participating in the Sheriff’s Theater Arts program. Learn more about the many Sheriff’s Department reentry programs preparing inmates for their return to society.

587,County Now Offering Pfizer’s COVID Vaccine to 12- to 15-Year-Olds,San Diegans ages 12-15 are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-now-offering-pfizers-covid-vaccine-to-12-to-15-year-olds/,2021-05-13T08:49:36-07:00,"
San Diegans ages 12-15 are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
The California Department of Public Health last night approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for use in that age group and the County’s vaccine sites are prepared to start vaccinating children in this new age group today.
Parental consent is required prior to vaccination for anyone under the age of 18. In addition to parental consent, minors will have to show photo ID and proof of age, or have the parent, guardian or caregiver who accompanies the minor to the appointment verify their age and identity.
If a parent, legal guardian or caregiver cannot accompany the minor to the vaccination site, they will need to schedule an appointment on MyTurn.ca.gov to provide their consent in advance. If no parent, guardian or caregiver can be present, the minor will have to bring photo ID and, if under the age of 16, another adult must be present during the vaccination appointment.
Additional information about scheduling appointments and what types of documentation youths will need to get vaccinated is available at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.
“Data from our federal and state partners shows that the Pfizer vaccine is both safe and effective for use in young people,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Getting youths 12 to 15 years old vaccinated will better protect vulnerable San Diegans and younger children who are not eligible to be vaccinated yet.”
The Pfizer vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine currently authorized for use in minors ages 12-15 and the majority of the County-operated COVID-19 vaccination sites carry it.
State figures show San Diego County has 175,864 people ages 12-15 and the County has enough doses on hand or coming in to vaccinate all eligible youths in the coming weeks.

Thursday was the first day that parents and their 12- to 15- year old children could begin receiving Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. Pfizer’s vaccine is the only one that has received FDA emergency approval for 12- to 15- year olds so far. Parental consent is required before anyone under the age of 18 can get vaccinated. Minors must show a photo ID and proof of age, or have the parent, guardian or caregiver accompanying them verify their age and identity when receiving a vaccination.
Parents, legal guardians and caregivers who cannot accompany their children to the vaccination site need to schedule an appointment on MyTurn.ca.gov to provide their consent in advance. If no parent, guardian or caregiver can be present, the minor will have to bring photo ID and, if under the age of 16, another adult must be present during the vaccination appointment.

595,More than Half of County Fully Vaccinated; County Adds More Mobile Events,"More than half of all San Diegans 12 years old and older — 50.3% — have now been fully vaccinated, County officials announced Thursday in an important milestone.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/more-than-half-of-county-fully-vaccinated-county-adds-more-mobile-events/,2021-05-20T17:32:59-07:00,"
More than half of all San Diegans 12 years old and older — 50.3% — have now been fully vaccinated, County officials announced Thursday in an important milestone.
Officials also announced that they’re continuing to expand mobile vaccination sites and that they have created a new video and visual art contest with prizes for youths between the ages of 12- to 24-years-old to show the importance of COVID-19 vaccinations.
In addition to surpassing the 50% fully-vaccinated mark for eligible county residents — representing nearly 1.41 million San Diegans — County officials said nearly two-thirds of those San Diegans 12 and older, 66.2%, have now had at least one shot.
Unlike the early days of the national vaccination effort, the region now has more supply of vaccine than there is demand. To help reach people who may have had difficulty getting to vaccination sites, County officials announced they plan to expand the number of mobile vaccination sites, with a list of new vaccination events stretching into late June at businesses, churches and religious centers, community and senior centers, and other locations.
County officials also announced they have created a “Youth Leadership” video and visual art vaccine challenge/contest, that will start Monday, May 24 and allow submissions through June 14, to engage the county’s youth in the vaccination effort.
Youths in three age groups, from 12- to 24-years-old, can win prizes for submitting videos and personal artwork about COVID-19 vaccinations in a number of categories. Those include short videos about why getting vaccinated was important to them personally or what they’re most excited about getting back to after being fully vaccinated, or art showing positive facts about COVID-19 vaccinations.
The “Our Health is Worth a Shot,” contest will offer prizes to youths in each of the three age categories who create winning videos or paintings, memes, posters, handouts, flyers or infographics. For more information, see the County’s Youth Challenge Contest website.

597,County Will Soon Make Overdose Reversal Medication Available To Anyone,"A COVID-19 related spike in overdose deaths in San Diego County has fueled a behavioral health crisis. In 2020, the County reported 457 fentanyl-related overdose deaths. This is a 202% increase in one year, from 151 recorded deaths in 2019.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-will-soon-make-overdose-reversal-medication-available-to-anyone/,2021-05-21T14:59:17-07:00,"
A COVID-19 related spike in overdose deaths in San Diego County has fueled a behavioral health crisis. In 2020, the County reported 457 fentanyl-related overdose deaths. This is a 202% increase in one year, from 151 recorded deaths in 2019.
To help save lives, the County will begin offering nasal Naloxone to the general public at several community-based locations and clinics throughout the region. Naloxone is a medication designed to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose and quickly restore normal respiration and alertness.
County Public Health Officer, Dr. Wilma Wooten M.D., M.P.H., in partnership with Chair Nathan Fletcher and County Director of Behavior Health, Luke Bergmann, signed a Naloxone Standing Order allowing community organizations to distribute nasal Naloxone. The overdose reversal drug will be available at no cost and without a prescription to any person at risk of an overdose or to a family member or friend willing to administer the drug. The expanded distribution is part of a harm reduction strategy that will be introduced at the Board of Supervisors meeting next month.
The County made Naloxone available to law enforcement many years ago, but like CPR, time is critical as overdose patients need immediate intervention to improve their chances of survival. In some situations the overdose patient needs immediate intervention to survive. An overdose from opioids may take hours to cause death, but other drugs such as fentanyl can cause death in a matter of minutes.
Nasal Naloxone is a prefilled, needle-free device that requires no assembly and is sprayed into one nostril while patients lay on their back. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says to look for these signs if you suspect someone is overdosing from heroin or prescription opioid pain medications:

Small, constricted “pinpoint pupils”
Limp body
Pale, clammy skin
Blue fingernails or lips
Vomiting or gurgling sounds
Unable to speak or be awakened, loss of consciousness
Slow breathing or slow heartbeat

The County offers numerous prevention and treatment programs across the region. People seeking help should call the San Diego County Access and Crisis Line 888-724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego. These resources are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

605,Parents Opening Home to Children in Foster Care Hope to Inspire Others,A couple who have been resource parents for the County of San Diego for 17 years shares why they continue to open their home to youths in foster care.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/parents-opening-home-to-children-in-foster-care-hope-to-inspire-others/,2021-05-27T12:15:51-07:00,"
For Rita and Juan Mejia, opening their home to children in foster care has been a lifelong passion. Over the course of 17 years, the couple have provided care to dozens of children for the County of San Diego.
But for Rita the commitment to caring for children in foster care started long before she and her husband became what is known as resource parents. Rita’s mother was a resource parent for more than 20 years and Rita often helped drive the children to appointments or activities.
Rita enjoyed the experience so much that she and Juan decided to start their own journey as resource parents in 2004. Since then, they have cared for 70 children of all ages and they’re not thinking of quitting anytime soon.
“I stay in touch with almost all of our foster children and it gives me so much joy to see them succeed,” Rita said. “A lot of them regularly visit or call, some of them now have families of their own and have brought over their children for dinner so we could meet them.”
Today, Rita and Juan have five children in their care. The children’s ages range from 4 to 12 years old. While no one day is like the other, especially in the last year of COVID-19 restrictions, they love the variety the children bring into their lives.
“During the week the children are all doing virtual learning and we help them with their classes and homework,” Rita said. “On the weekends we like to take the kids to the beach or to SeaWorld. We really want our foster children to feel like they’re part of the family, so we make sure we give them some of the experiences our own three kids had when they were growing up.”
“Many foster children lack a strong support system and foster families can make such a huge difference for those kids,” Juan said. “To me and my wife, the love these children give is the best gift anyone could ask for.”
The County of San Diego is always looking for new parents willing to open their home to a child or teen. Getting started is easy and the County offers orientation meetings on an ongoing basis to help families who are interested in fostering determine if they are a good fit.

607,County Installs Free Menstrual Product Dispensers in Public Facilities,"The County of San Diego has launched a pilot program to support greater access to free menstrual products, including tampons and pads.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-installs-free-menstrual-product-dispensers-in-public-facilities/,2021-05-28T11:02:20-07:00,"
The County of San Diego has launched a pilot program to support greater access to free menstrual products, including tampons and pads. The Free 4 Menstrual Equity, or Free4ME program, intends to address period poverty, a person’s inability to access or pay for menstrual products.
As part of the pilot program, the County recently partnered with Aunt Flow to install 57 free menstrual product dispensers in 23 County-owned facilities across the region. The facilities include libraries, Family Resource Centers and Community Centers.
“As a longtime healthcare and reproductive justice advocate, I am proud the County of San Diego has not just heard this call but is the first known county government in the nation to take concrete action to support the menstrual equity movement,” said Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Nora Vargas. “Period poverty disproportionately impacts people experiencing homelessness, transgender people, youth and low-income individuals, and has only been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.”
Studies show that nearly two-thirds of low-income people with periods in the U.S. have been unable to afford menstruation products during the previous year, and frequently must decide between purchasing food or other necessities and menstrual hygiene products.
The issue disproportionately affects school-aged individuals, with one recent study showing that one in five youths have missed school because they didn’t have access to menstrual products during their period.
“It is important that people who menstruate have access to menstrual health products,” said Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer. “They should be provided in our restrooms just as we provide toilet paper and paper towels.”
Food stamps and WIC do not cover the purchase of menstrual products, forcing many individuals to ration sanitary products by using them for extended amounts of time, or using unsanitary items to manage their periods.
“Menstrual equity is a public health issue because individuals who do not have access to menstrual products are at a greater risk for infections that can make them more susceptible to infertility,” said Kelly Motadel, M.D., M.P.H., County child health officer. “The fact that these issues primarily affect vulnerable communities, especially along income lines, should move and motivate progress towards achieving menstrual equity.”
The Free4ME initiative was sparked by local community leaders including Youth Will and Planned Parenthood. Both organizations provided critical input into the development and evaluation of the program.
The County’s vendor for the menstrual product dispensers, Aunt Flow, is a leader in the menstrual equity movement. The company stocks its dispensers with 100% organic cotton products, which contributes to the County’s commitment to sustainability.
The long-term goal of Free4ME is to install free menstrual product dispensers in all public-facing County facilities.

As people prepare to celebrate the holiday weekend, County health officials are reminding the public to continue taking precautions to avoid getting and transmitting COVID-19.
While the number of local COVID-19 cases has significantly decreased in recent weeks, not enough San Diegans have been vaccinated for the region to achieve herd immunity.
“The pandemic is not over. We must continue taking precautions to protect San Diegans who can’t or won’t get vaccinated,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People who have not been vaccinated should be wearing a mask, keeping their distance and avoiding large gatherings.”
Prizes for Getting Vaccinated
San Diegans who get vaccinated against COVID-19 will be able to participate in the state’s drawing to distribute $116.5 million in prizes.  The state will be including all the names in the San Diego Immunization Registry in its drawing.
Two million Californians who have not gotten vaccinated will be eligible to get a $50 gift card if they get vaccinated by June 15. The $100 million in gift cards will be distributed when they are fully vaccinated.
The names of people who are fully vaccinated will be entered into a drawing on June 4 and June 11. Fifteen people will each win $50,000 on each date. That’s $1.5 million.
And on June 15, the state will draw 10 winners who will each receive $1.5 million for a total of $15 million.

609,Pet Preparedness Month Reminds Residents to Make Plans for Furry Family Member,"June is National Pet Preparedness Month, and the County of San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services and Department of Animal Services are reminding residents to make sure their family disaster preparedness plan includes provisions for their household pets.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/pet-preparedness-month-reminds-residents-to-make-plans-for-furry-family-member/,2021-06-01T09:48:41-07:00,"
June is National Pet Preparedness Month, and the County of San Diego’s Office of Emergency Services and Department of Animal Services are reminding residents to make sure their family disaster preparedness plan includes provisions for their household pets.
Just like other family members, pets require their own disaster preparedness kit that includes an ample supply of food and water. The kit should also include items such as a crate or travel carrier, required medications, veterinary records, grooming items, and sanitation needs like kitty litter and plastic pet waste bags.
Pets should always have a collar with an ID tag that lists the contact number for the owner. An even better way to help protect your furry family member is to have your pets microchipped. In the event pets are ever separated from their owner, many veterinarians and animal shelters have the capability to scan the microchip to obtain contact information.
County residents should never leave their pets at home during an emergency that requires evacuation. More than likely, it will take several hours or even days before residents can return to their homes. Pets might also be trapped in structures if wildfires approach, or damage to structures could allow pets to escape or to fall victim to predators.
It is also important to have recent photographs of your pet. These are important if the pet is lost, and you need to post a “missing animal” notice, and they even help to prove ownership in some circumstances. Photos should be stored on a mobile device or cloud-type storage system for easy access from remote locations.
During an ordered evacuation, the Department of Animal Services typically provides shelter at a county shelter or other location for displaced pets who cannot stay with their owners. While this is a valuable resource, pet owners are also encouraged to have a list of pet-friendly hotels and local animal boarding facilities in case they are needed.
The Department of Animal Services provides residents with an easy-to-use Pet Preparedness Plan. The Office of Emergency Services also provides information on how to prepare pets for potential emergency situations, including a helpful video on the Ready San Diego website.
Microchipping is available at both Department of Animal Service locations by appointment only. To schedule an appointment, call (619) 767-2675.
County residents who own livestock are also encouraged to have an emergency plan to evacuate animals in a timely manner. The Department of Animal Services has published a Disaster Preparedness for Livestock Guide that is full of valuable information.

622,County Health Advisory Task Force Seeking Public Input On Social Services In June,"A County advisory board task force is inviting people to help the County improve how it connects people to social services that help them get food, housing and health care by sharing their program experiences in four special webinars this month.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-health-advisory-task-force-seeking-public-input-on-social-services-in-june/,2021-06-11T12:42:40-07:00,"
A County advisory board task force is inviting people to help the County improve how it connects people to social services that help them get food, housing and health care by sharing their program experiences in four special webinars this month.
Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer and the “Outreach, Accessibility, and Enrollment Ad-hoc Task Force,” a subcommittee of the County’s Social Services Advisory Board, are holding four listening session webinars in June. The webinars are part of a larger process to find ways to improve social services, increase participation in them, and report recommendations to the County Board of Supervisors this fall.
The services the webinars are focusing on are:

CalFresh: Also called SNAP or food stamps, which provides people with EBT cards with funds to buy groceries
Medi-Cal: Also referred to as Medicaid, which provides free or no-cost health insurance
CalWORKS: Also called TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, which provides temporary cash assistance on EBT cards.
General Relief: The program that offers temporary cash assistance on EBT cards
Cash Assistance Program for Immigrants (CAPI) – The program that offers monthly cash benefits to elderly, blind and disabled non-citizens ineligible for SSI/SSP because of their immigration status.

Who’s Invited
The webinars are inviting people who have ever applied for, considered applying for, or been denied access to those programs to share their stories. Specifically, the task force wants to hear how people feel the programs worked for them, what could be done better, how they feel about their experience applying for and using them, and to identify obstacles that may keep people from enrolling in them.
Webinars 
The times, dates and topics of the webinars, and links to register to take part in them are:

June 15, noon to 2 p.m.: General Relief/CalWORKs
Register by clicking here or at http://bit.ly/GRCalWorks-1
June 15, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.: Calfresh/Medi-Cal
Register here or at http://bit.ly/MediCalFresh-1

Register here or at http://bit.ly/MediCalFresh-2
June 22, 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.: General Relief/CalWORKs
Register here or at http://bit.ly/GRCalWorks-2

Taking part is as easy. Just register online for one or more of the meetings on the webinar links. Then, join in by clicking the meeting link that will be included in the confirmation email that will be sent to you.
Webinar participants can join in on their iPhones, Droid devices, personal computers or Macs, and people can share their experiences in small break-out groups at the webinars rather than in front of large audiences.
Each of the sessions will be introduced by Supervisor Lawson-Remer; members of the task force will provide presentations about the social services and facilitate the public discussion in the smaller break-out groups. The task force will also conduct a survey with the break-out groups to gather their input, and then work with a consultant to create recommendations to improve services to bring to the Board of Supervisors.
The webinars in June are solely for the public. The task force also plans to hold additional webinars with other stakeholder groups: community-based organizations that help people apply for social services, County workers and County Health and Human Services Agency leaders.

624,Stay Cool During Weeklong Heatwave ,"High temperatures over the next week in San Diego, particularly the deserts, are cause for extra precaution.

High temperatures over the next week in San Diego, particularly the deserts, are cause for extra precaution. Residents are advised to stay cool, avoid activities that may cause overheating, and pay extra attention to older adults, people with chronic medical conditions, young children and pets because they are more susceptible to heat illness.
The National Weather Service issued an excessive heat warning for county deserts starting Monday and continuing through Friday. Temperatures are predicted to range from 112 to 120 degrees in those areas including the community of Borrego Springs. Forecasters also issued an excessive heat watch for the mountains and valleys, with the hottest temperatures expected Tuesday through Thursday.
Hot temperatures can be particularly dangerous for seniors, and they are advised to stay home. Borrego residents who do not have access to air conditioning at home can visit the Borrego Springs County Library branch, a County Cool Zone, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 2580 Country Club Road. Additional sites will be posted next week on the Cool Zones website.
Please note that regardless of vaccination status, anyone who enters a cool zone must wear a facial covering inside. This is in adherence to guidance from the California Department of Public Health.
Health officials recommend people do the following to avoid overheating

If available, stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty
Take cool showers
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car
Keep pets cool in hot weather
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun
Avoid using the oven to cook

An extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion, and headache are signs of heatstroke or exhaustion. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature and continue cooling efforts
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

For more information on extreme heat, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For more information on the Cool Zones program as well as tips to stay cool at home, visit www.coolzones.org.

People who attend mega events indoor will be required to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test before they arrive at the venue. Organizers of outdoor mega events will be strongly encouraged to implement the same safety protocols, though they will not be required to do so.
Face covering mandates will remain in effect after tomorrow in nine settings: on public transit, indoors in K-12 schools and in childcare settings, in healthcare settings, long term care facilities, detention centers, homeless shelters, emergency shelters and cooling centers.
The state guidance will remain in place until at least October 1.
“The end of the state’s framework will allow us to go back to many of the activities we have not been able to enjoy since last March, but the pandemic does not end tomorrow,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “COVID-19 is still present in our community and we all need to continue to do our part to protect the most vulnerable and avoid spreading the virus.”

The County has opened additional cool zones in rural areas to help residents beat the heat.
Nine cool zones are now open in County libraries and community centers, some of which include extended and weekend hours.
The high temperatures are expected to last through the end of the week.  Residents, particularly in desert communities, are advised to stay cool, avoid activities that may cause overheating.
Hot temperatures can be particularly dangerous for seniors, and they are advised to stay home
Please note that regardless of vaccination status, anyone who enters a cool zone must wear a facial covering inside. This is in adherence to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Health officials recommend people do the following to avoid overheating:

If available, stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty
Take cool showers
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car
Keep pets cool in hot weather
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun
Avoid using the oven to cook

An extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion, and headache are signs of heatstroke or exhaustion. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature and continue cooling efforts
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

630,Final County Budget Hearing Wednesday Evening,"The second budget hearing for the recommended Fiscal Year 2021-22 budget takes place at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 16.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/final-county-budget-hearing-wednesday-evening/,2021-06-15T19:26:42-07:00,"
The second budget hearing for the recommended Fiscal Year 2021-22 budget takes place at 5:30 p.m. on Wednesday, June 16.
The Chief Administrative Officer’s recommended budget was released to the public on May 6. Budget presentations were held on May 26 and 27 and public hearings began on June 14.
The budget is designed to reflect residents’ needs and build a Framework for the Future that will fundamentally change County operations.
It calls for $7.03 billion in fiscal year 2021-22 spending, an increase of 7.3% and a net increase of 660 additional staff years, excluding staff from the Air Pollution Control District which became an independent agency on March 1.
Investments in both funding and staff are designed to make an impact in these key areas:
Justice System Reform
This budget prioritizes justice system reform, focusing on preventive over punitive measures and expanded reentry support for those who are involved in the justice system to reduce recidivism and result in more positive outcomes.
Medical care and access to mental health services will be expanded throughout the jail system with 141 additional staff, and $10 million will expand the Mobile Crisis Response Team program used as an alternative to dispatching law enforcement for individuals in crisis.
The County is also investing $75 million for phase two of the new Youth Transition Campus to move away from a traditional correctional, punitive model that looks, feels, and operates like a jail to one that fosters a framework for positive youth development that is shown to support improved well-being and outcomes.
Racial Justice
The newly formed Office of Equity and Racial Justice and the Human Relations Commission are working hand in hand with the community to create systemic change inside and outside of County government to ensure positive human relations and respect for everyone in the region.
Within the County, the goal is to create a culture of equity, belonging and racial justice. Community voices and employees will look at County operations through an equity and racial justice lens for disparities. Their feedback and the enhanced use of data analysis will help root out systemic racism.
The new budget will also support new projects from the Office of Equity and Racial Justice such as the initiative designed to Uplift Boys and Men of Color.
Behavioral Health
The budget also prioritizes support for behavioral health, dedicating almost $813 million overall, including increases to redesign and enhance programs and services. This also includes mobile outreach for clients reluctant to engage in traditional settings, lowering staff-to-client ratios, enhancing crisis stabilization services, and helping ensure behavioral health clients are placed at the correct level of care possibly reducing emergency room use.
The budget also funds $3.2 million for 23 nurses supporting the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, which provides critical crisis stabilization and inpatient behavioral health services to some of San Diego County’s most vulnerable residents, as well as additional mental health support for adults and youth involved in the justice system.
Health Equity
The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for health equity. The recommended budget invests $226.9 million toward continued response to COVID-19 and includes diversely targeted outreach for hard-hit neighborhoods and other vulnerable populations, continued testing, treatment and tracing efforts, and meals to at-risk seniors. The budget also increases funding to help every person live the healthiest life possible. This includes 166 additional positions to meet increased demand for safety net services including the CalFresh and Medi-Cal programs, and provides extra staffing for Adult Protective Services, In-Home Supportive Services and Child Welfare Services.
Economic Opportunity
The new budget along with an anticipated allocation of $650 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding is focused on economic recovery. The funding will provide senior and youth services, small business stimulus funds, permit fee waivers for the events industry, expanded broadband access, infrastructure, child care subsidies, food assistance and mental health services.
Homelessness
The budget calls for new ways to make progress on this critical issue, including the creation of a Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities to streamline operations that are spread across several County agencies. The budget also includes 19 new positions and a $2.5 million increase for Community Care Coordination programs to support veterans, youth and high-need individuals with housing and other assistance. Separately, the Board of Supervisors has created a framework for the approximately $650 million to be received through the American Rescue Plan Act with $85 million currently earmarked for services to support those who are homeless.
Housing Accessibility and Affordability
The federal allocation of $107 million will continue offering rental assistance through the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. The budget also includes increased funding for the CalWORKs Housing Support program to help families in need find and retain permanent housing and $2.7 million to encourage development of Accessory Dwelling Units, or ADUs, by waiving permit and impact fees and offering pre-approved plans to save time and cost.
Environmental Protection
The budget calls for $104.5 million for environmental protection and includes reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, planting trees, acquiring at least 500 acres of land for open space, protecting water quality and agriculture, and diverting waste from landfills. Funding will also broaden the Environmental Justice Element in the County’s General Plan to reduce pollution exposure and promote public facilities, food access, safe and sanitary homes, and physical activities in underserved communities.
Government Transparency
The budget provides resources to support a new subcommittee to enhance accessibility and open government within County operations that includes engaging the public in the County budget and Board of Supervisors meetings. The subcommittee will also review and assess a Public Records Act portal, accessing archived public records and the County’s email retention policy.
Community Investments
The budget calls for $279.6 million in capital projects to improve communities throughout the region. This includes a new Otay Mesa Fire Station, new Casa De Oro Library and Julian Library Community Room, and more than $70 million for new parks, trails and recreational areas to enjoy the outdoors and preserve open space.
Budget Timeline and How to Comment
After the Wednesday evening hearing, the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to begin budget deliberations and adoption at 2 p.m., on Tuesday, June 29.
The public can attend and provide comments in person at both the evening hearing and during deliberations. COVID-19 safety precautions on physical distancing and health screenings have been lifted. Room capacity limits are back to normal and both the south and east entrances to the County Administration Center will be open. Face masks will be required for those who have not been vaccinated against COVID-19.
The public can also watch the meetings live online and make a request to speak via teleconference or submit a written eComment. The online comments can be submitted until budget hearings close at 5 p.m. on Wednesday, June 23.

631,San Pasqual Academy Celebrates 20th Anniversary with Graduation Ceremony for Foster Youth,It was all pomp and circumstance at San Pasqual Academy on a recent morning as 12 students celebrated their graduation day.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-pasqual-academy-celebrates-20th-anniversary-with-graduation-ceremony-for-foster-youth/,2021-06-18T10:12:07-07:00,"
It was all pomp and circumstance at San Pasqual Academy (SPA) on a recent morning as 12 students celebrated their graduation day. SPA is the first-in-the-nation residential educational foster academy, and 2021 marks the 20th anniversary of the campus.
Designed specifically for foster youth, SPA serves as a placement option for dependents of the Juvenile Court between the ages of 12 and 17. The campus also provides a home to non-minor dependents up to 19 years old.
The campus has been home to Eman Mansour-Ponce since the fall of 2018. When she arrived at SPA, she says she had a 1.19 GPA and was ready to drop out of high school.
Fast forward two and a half years and the 18-year-old is now a high school graduate with a 3.0 GPA. She is headed to San Francisco State University in the fall.
“When I got to SPA, I received the support and tools I needed and that motivated me to set better goals and apply myself academically,” said Mansour-Ponce.
SPA offers a comprehensive support system for its students, including an individualized academic plan, work readiness training, therapeutic services, and extracurricular activities, like clubs and sports.
Mansour-Ponce got involved in a wide variety of extracurricular activities, including basketball and softball. She credits these activities for allowing her to discover herself.
“Before I came to SPA I was never able to just be a kid and do the things I enjoy,” Mansour-Ponce said. “My time at the academy really opened my eyes to what’s out there and made me realize that I can do whatever I set my mind to.”
Mansour-Ponce is excited to head to college in the fall but is leaving the academy with mixed feelings.
“My SPA community has become my family and I am sad to leave it all behind,” Mansour-Ponce said. “But this is my opportunity to head out into the world on my own and prove myself and I’m grateful SPA helped me get to where I am today.”
SPA is a public-private partnership between the County of San Diego, New Alternatives, Inc., San Diego County Office of Education, and Access, Inc. Since SPA was founded, more than 425 students have graduated from the on-site high school and over 120 of them have enrolled in four-year universities.

“The Vital Aging conference has long been the region’s premier go-to event for older San Diegans and caregivers, but this year it is especially important as we begin to emerge from the pandemic,” said Kim Gallo, director, San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency Aging & Independence Services. “This virtual event is a great opportunity for participants to reconnect with the community and move toward a healthy, engaged, and hopeful future.”
This year’s keynote speaker is Henry Winkler. Winkler is a best-selling author and Emmy Award-winning actor, director, and producer. He is best known for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli, aka “The Fonz,” on the TV show Happy Days.

The County Health and Human Services Agency has been recognized by the National Association of County and City Health Officials for five initiatives related to the region’s COVID-19 response. The County received one gold award, one silver award, two bronze awards and an honorable mention.
Gold Award
HHSA received the gold award for its efforts in proactively reaching out to over 400 health care providers, providing personalized consultations in areas with the highest case rates of COVID-19. Over a span of nine months, a County health care sector team communicated with all types of health care practices, including primary care, specialists, home health, alternative care and community clinics, through email and phone, sending over 600 emails and placing over 1,000 phone calls.
The goal of the initiative was to supply health care providers with the information they needed to connect patients to COVID-19 vaccinations, testing, health education resources and COVID-19 treatment. This effort contributed to reducing COVID-19 disparities, especially in minority communities which were some of the hardest-hit by the virus.
Silver Award
The County was recognized with a silver award for its population health approach to the pandemic. The County developed teams of subject-matter experts who communicated information about COVID-19 to various sectors of the economy based on the specific needs of a group. Sectors included businesses, faith organizations, schools, the military, service providers for people experiencing homelessness, and others.
Sector teams strengthened existing connections between the County and the community and allowed members of the respective groups to have a regular dialogue with each other.
Bronze Awards
The County received two bronze awards, one for its hygiene kit distribution program and another for its cross-border communication and collaboration efforts.
Since March 2020, the County distributed over 32,000 COVID-19 prevention hygiene kits to people experiencing homelessness. The kits included hand sanitizer, antiseptic wipes, bottled water, facial coverings and brochures with information about COVID-19 testing and vaccination opportunities.
The second bronze award recognizes the County’s efforts in communicating and collaborating with health officials in Baja California, Mexico. Recognizing the interconnectivity of the San Diego-Tijuana border region, the County initiated binational telebriefings at the onset of the pandemic to better address COVID-19 on both sides of the border.
Over the last 14 months, officials on both sides of the border have shared data, facilitated cross-border medical care, coordinated large binational personal protective equipment donations, and implemented testing and vaccine strategies. The County’s binational sector is the only formal cross-border structure that was formed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic along the entire US-Mexico border.
Honorable mention
The County’s Community Health Worker Communication and Outreach Services team received an honorable mention for its efforts in communicating pertinent COVID-19 information to the region’s communities of color. Throughout the pandemic, African Americans, Asian Pacific Islanders, Latinos, and refugee communities were disproportionately affected by COVID-19.
The County brought on a number of contracted partners to ensure vital information was shared in a culturally appropriate manner and in multiple languages to reach the diverse communities. The contractors also engaged each community of focus through traditional advertising and promotion, home visits, phone calls, and social media.

Best-selling author and Emmy Award-winning actor, director, and producer Henry Winkler delivered the keynote address at the County’s “Vital Aging 2021: Resilient and Ready!” conference Thursday. Winkler is best known for his role as Arthur Fonzarelli, aka “The Fonz,” on the TV show Happy Days.
Winkler shared his thoughts and experiences about resiliency during difficult times, serving the community and enjoying the aging process.
“You’ve got a choice, your glass is either half full or half empty and it is how you look at it, not how anybody else looks at it,” Winkler said.
The Vital Aging conference made its return virtually after a one-year hiatus due to COVID-19. Winkler and the other speakers addressed a variety of subjects, aiming to inspire attendees to re-energize their lives so they can thrive again after spending much of the last year at home.
Among his tips for living longer and healthier lives, Winkler recommended to stay connected and to “not allow your brain to go idle.” He also encouraged people to focus on what they can do, instead of what they are unable to do.
“Don’t take the fact that something is not working and say everything is not working,” Winkler said. “You take something that is not working, you acknowledge it, and you take all the things that are working, and you keep them working. You are in control!”

640,County COVID-19 Vaccination Transitioning to Public Health Sites,"Due to a significant drop in demand for COVID-19 vaccines, the County is phasing out some of its vaccination sites, but the push to vaccinate San Diegans continues.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-covid-19-vaccination-transitioning-to-public-health-sites/,2021-06-25T13:55:45-07:00,"
Due to a significant drop in demand for COVID-19 vaccines, the County is phasing out some of its vaccination sites, but the push to vaccinate San Diegans continues.
Some County vaccination sites have closed or will be closing at the end of this month; however, people who have not been vaccinated still have plenty of options to do so.
“As expected, demand for COVID-19 vaccines has waned significantly,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While we have to phase out some vaccination clinics, San Diegans still have plenty of places to get vaccinated to protect themselves and others. Throughout the pandemic, the County has focused on equity and has been reaching out to communities and populations that have vaccine hesitancy.”
The County has reached the federal goal to vaccinate 70% of San Diego County residents 12 and older, or 1,961807 people, with at least one dose.
Overall, more than 2.16 million San Diegans have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine and more than 1.83 million are fully vaccinated.
San Diegans are encouraged to continue getting vaccinated to prevent getting and passing the COVID-19 virus to others.
Vaccinations continue to be available at more than 400 locations, including doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies and County clinics throughout the region. Some vaccination sites will continue to offer extended hours to make it easier for San Diegans to get immunized.
“The more people who get vaccinated, the better chance we have at ending this pandemic locally,” Wooten added.
In addition to existing COVID-19 vaccination clinics, County partners like local municipalities, Champions for Health, UC San Diego Health, San Diego American Indian Health Center and the San Diego Black Nurses Association will be handling requests for mobile vaccination events. Organizations wishing to host a vaccination event can submit a request.
No-cost COVID-19 testing sites remain operational around the County. For a complete list of County testing and vaccination locations and more vaccine information, visit coronavirus-sd.com.

641,Health Officials Seeking Persons Who May Have Touched Rabid Bat at Safari Park,"The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is looking for anybody that may have come into contact with a live bat that tested positive for rabies and was found at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park on June 25, 2021.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/health-officials-seeking-persons-who-may-have-touched-rabid-bat-at-safari-park/,2021-06-27T11:58:23-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is looking for anybody that may have come into contact with a live bat that tested positive for rabies and was found at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park on June 25, 2021.
The bat was found alive on Friday in the Mombasa Island Pavilion and was collected by a trained park employee. No human contact with the bat has been reported at this time.
If you or someone in your family or group had contact with the bat, you are urged to contact the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency as soon as possible at (619) 692-8499. If you did not have direct contact with the bat, such as touching or holding the animal, you are not at risk for rabies.
The bat was not one of the park’s collection animals. It was delivered to the County on June 25 and testing confirmed the animal to be positive for rabies. There has been one other rabid bat found in San Diego County so far this year.
“Human rabies is usually fatal without prompt post-exposure vaccine and treatment,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “There has been no reported human or animal contact with this bat, but it was found in an area where many park visitors pass by, and we want to make sure that no one had contact with it.”
Rabies transmission can occur from a bat bite or if a bat’s saliva comes in contact with a cut or abrasion, or with mucous membranes, such as the eyes, nose or mouth.
“People should always stay away from bats and other wild animals to prevent possible exposure to rabies,” said Wooten. “If you see a bat, dead or alive, don’t touch it.”
Rabies in humans can be prevented by avoiding contact with wild, stray, and unknown domestic animals, ensuring pets are up-to-date on rabies vaccinations, and receiving prompt medical advice following animal bites and other significant exposures to potentially rabid animals. Rabies is not uncommon in wild bats in San Diego County.
If direct contact with a bat does occur, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and get medical advice immediately.

643,County Adopts $7.23 Billion Budget,The County Board of Supervisors adopted a $7.23 billion revised budget for fiscal year 2021-22 after public deliberations on Tuesday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-adopts-7-23-billion-budget/,2021-06-29T17:32:27-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors adopted a $7.23 billion revised budget for fiscal year 2021-22 after public deliberations on Tuesday.
The adopted budget responds to voices in the community and follows a Framework for the Future that will fundamentally change County operations, with significant funding to address justice system reform, racial justice, health and environmental equity, homelessness and economic opportunity.
“This is a budget that meets the needs of all our residents,” County Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer said, “… stretching, but maintaining a prudent and responsible fiscal position.”
A $7.03 billion recommended budget was presented to the Board on May 6 and called for a 7.3% increase. The Board approved additional spending on Tuesday, adding $200.9 million to the budget.
As a result, the revised $7.23 billion budget represents an increase of $681.1 million, or 10.4%, over last year’s. The revised budget also adds nearly 1,000 employees for a total of 18,782.5 staff years.
Justice System Reform
The revised budget prioritizes justice system reform, focusing on preventive over punitive measures and expanded reentry support for those who are involved in the justice system to reduce recidivism and result in more positive outcomes.
Medical care and access to mental health services will be expanded throughout the jail system with 141 additional staff, and $10 million will expand the Mobile Crisis Response Team program used as an alternative to dispatching law enforcement for individuals in crisis. The revised budget added another $2.5 million bringing the total to $12.5 million.
The revised budget also provides the Sheriff’s Department with 58 extra employees and increased funding to expand Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) services in County jails.
The County is also investing $75 million for phase two of the new Youth Transition Campus to move away from a traditional correctional, punitive model that looks, feels, and operates like a jail to one that fosters a framework for positive youth development that is shown to support improved well-being and outcomes.
The Public Defender’s Office will see funding in the revised budget for a one-year pilot for an Immigrant Rights Legal Defense Program. The pilot will also offer translation services to detained immigrants.
The revised budget will also allow San Diego County Fire to create three member teams at three remote fire stations.
Racial Justice
The revised budget provides a net increase of $0.6 million for the newly formed Office of Equity and Racial Justice. The funding will support equity in County programs, support training, organizational development, and change management.
The  budget will also support new projects from the Office of Equity and Racial Justice such as the initiative designed to Uplift Boys and Men of Color.
Behavioral Health
The budget also prioritizes support for behavioral health, dedicating almost $813 million overall, including increases to redesign and enhance programs and services. This also includes mobile outreach for clients reluctant to engage in traditional settings, lowering staff-to-client ratios, enhancing crisis stabilization services, and helping ensure behavioral health clients are placed at the correct level of care possibly reducing emergency room use.
The budget also funds $3.2 million for 23 nurses supporting the San Diego County Psychiatric Hospital, which provides critical crisis stabilization and inpatient behavioral health services to some of San Diego County’s most vulnerable residents, as well as additional mental health support for adults and youth involved in the justice system.
Health Equity
The COVID-19 pandemic underscores the need for health equity. The recommended budget invests $226.9 million toward continued response to COVID-19 and includes diversely targeted outreach for hard-hit neighborhoods and other vulnerable populations, continued testing, treatment and tracing efforts, and meals for at-risk seniors. The budget also increases funding to help every person live the healthiest life possible. This includes 166 additional positions to meet increased demand for safety net services including the CalFresh and Medi-Cal programs, and provides extra staffing for Adult Protective Services, In-Home Supportive Services and Child Welfare Services.
An extra $89.4 million in the revised budget will support infectious disease testing, case investigation and contact tracing, surveillance, containment and mitigation. Funding will also advance health equity in racial and ethnic minority groups and rural populations.
Economic Opportunity
The new budget, along with an anticipated allocation of $650 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding, is focused on economic recovery. The funding will provide senior and youth services, small business stimulus funds, permit fee waivers for the events industry, expanded broadband access, infrastructure, child-care subsidies, food assistance and mental health services.
A revised budget increase of $1.1 million and 5.00 staff years will support the newly established Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement.
Homelessness
The budget calls for new ways to make progress on this critical issue, including the creation of a Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities department, to streamline operations that are spread across several County agencies. The budget also includes 19 new positions and a $2.5 million increase for Community Care Coordination programs to support veterans, youth and high-need individuals with housing and other assistance. Separately, the Board of Supervisors has created a framework for the approximately $650 million to be received through the American Rescue Plan Act with $85 million currently earmarked for services to support those who are homeless.
Housing Accessibility and Affordability
A combined $107 million state and federal allocation will continue offering rental assistance through the Emergency Rental Assistance Program. The budget also includes increased funding for the CalWORKs Housing Support program to help families in need find and retain permanent housing and $2.7 million to encourage development of accessory dwelling units, or ADUs, by waiving permit and impact fees and offering pre-approved plans to save time and cost.
An increase of $25.0 million will expand funding for the Innovative Housing Trust Fund (IHTF) and other housing initiatives to increase production and preservation of affordable housing.
Environmental Protection
The budget calls for $104.5 million for environmental protection and includes reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, planting trees, acquiring at least 500 acres of land for open space, protecting water quality and agriculture, and diverting waste from landfills.
The newly established Office of Environmental and Climate Justice will see a revised budget increase of $1.3 million and three additional staff.
Funding will also broaden the Environmental Justice Element in the County’s General Plan to reduce pollution exposure and promote public facilities, food access, safe and sanitary homes, and physical activities in underserved communities.
Government Transparency
The budget provides resources to support a new subcommittee to enhance accessibility and open government within County operations that includes engaging the public in the County budget and Board of Supervisors meetings. The subcommittee will also review and assess a Public Records Act portal, accessing archived public records and the County’s email retention policy.
The revised budget includes an additional $4.5 million and 20.00 staff years for the newly established Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics.
Community Investments
The budget calls for $282.7 million in capital projects to improve communities throughout the region. This includes a new Otay Mesa Fire Station, new Casa De Oro Library and Julian Library Community Room, and more than $70 million for new parks, trails and recreational areas to enjoy the outdoors and preserve open space.
The budget plan is part of a two-year operational plan that will help determine how the County spends its resources. The first year of the plan for Fiscal Year 2021-22 was adopted Tuesday; the second year was approved in principle.
The new fiscal year budget takes effect on Thursday, July 1.

644,County Residents Asked to Take Public Safety Power Shutoff Survey,The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services is asking all County residents to fill out a survey about the Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-residents-asked-to-take-public-safety-power-shutoff-survey/,2021-06-30T09:04:46-07:00,"
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services is asking all County residents to fill out a survey about the Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) program.
PSPS is a prevention program sponsored by San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&E) to reduce the potential for utility-related wildfires. SDG&E will temporarily shut off power to customers in specific areas when wind speed, vegetative moisture, temperature and humidity create a high risk for wildfires.
Stakeholder and community feedback on PSPS is critical to advancing public safety throughout the County.
Over the past few years, surveys and public workshops have yielded new ideas on how to keep communities and customers safe from wildfires and other disasters, and how to mitigate the impacts of PSPS events.
Those who choose to include their email address in the survey will be invited to attend a virtual PSPS workshop later this year. The workshop will include a review of the survey results, and an opportunity to provide additional feedback on current efforts.
The PSPS survey will be available until July 13, 2021, and all County residents are encouraged to provide feedback and ideas on how to mitigate the impacts of PSPS events.
Additional information on how to prepare for and deal with a power outage is available at Ready San Diego.

There is no mistaking the positive impact vaccines have had in the battle against COVID-19. As the region continues to break out of the pandemic bubble, the County is focused on providing easy vaccine access, especially in hard-hit and hesitant communities. Veterans and military families in East County don’t have many vaccination options in their community, so the VA, STEP Program, SD Veterans Coalition and the VFW teamed-up to host a vaccination clinic in Lakeside.

648,Keep Your Dogs Safe Over Fourth of July,"For most dogs, Fourth of July fireworks are an assault to their sensitive ears, and the explosive booms and shrill sounds are extremely frightening. Frequently, dogs who are kept outdoors or are unleashed escape yards or run away in panic putting themselves in danger.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/keep-your-dogs-safe-over-fourth-of-july/,2021-07-02T09:17:43-07:00,"
For most dogs, Fourth of July fireworks are an assault to their sensitive ears, and the explosive booms and shrill sounds are extremely frightening. Frequently, dogs who are kept outdoors or are unleashed escape yards or run away in panic putting themselves in danger.
Once your dog is on the run, they can get lost and not be able to return home on their own, they can be hit by a vehicle, or they can even be attacked by other animals.
If they’re lucky, a neighbor may be able to grab them before they get too far or run out in traffic and get hurt. But if the owner is not around, they often end up in the animal shelters.
“With many people becoming new dog owners over the past year, it is important to be alert to their dog’s reaction to fireworks. And if the noise is a problem for their dog, there are things they can do to help dogs feel safe and secure,” said County Animal Services Director Kelly Campbell. “We recommend keeping dogs inside and in a secure room as some dogs can have extreme panicky reactions that may include digging under, climbing over or even breaking through gates, screens, fences, windows and doors. The backup plan is microchipping your pet, in case they still manage to run away.”
Every year, dozens of dogs end up at shelters after fireworks shows.
Some dogs are quickly reunited with their owners because they are licensed and microchipped. If your dog is not microchipped, residents in the unincorporated areas can get their dogs microchipped for a $20 fee at the County’s two shelters in Carlsbad and Bonita by calling (619) 767-2675 for an appointment.
Here are some additional tips on how to protect your pet this Fourth of July:

Stay home with your dogs.
Avoid taking your pet to fireworks displays. Keep your pets indoors in a sheltered, quiet area.
Some dogs become destructive when frightened so remove dangerous objects your pet may chew. Leave a television or radio playing at normal volume to keep your pet company while you’re away.
Never leave pets outside unattended, even in a fenced yard. In their fear, pets that normally wouldn’t leave the yard may escape and get lost.
If you know your pet is seriously distressed by loud noises like thunder, consult your veterinarian to see if anxiety-relieving medication is appropriate.
Do not leave your pet in the car. With only hot air to breathe inside a car, your pet can suffer serious health effects, even death, within minutes.
If you are walking your dog near fireworks displays, be sure your pet is secured on a leash in case it tries to bolt.

If you find a lost pet in the unincorporated area of the County after the fireworks, call County Animal Services’ 24-hour emergency dispatch number at (619) 236-2341 so the animal can be cared for at the shelter. If you lose your pet, check the department’s lost and found page online.
If you see your dog is at County Animal Services, you can pick up your pet starting at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 6.

650,County Launches Electric Vehicle Consumer Guide,"Looking to help County residents who are thinking about buying an electric vehicle, the County of San Diego has created a new Electric Vehicle Consumer Guide website with information about benefits, costs, incentives — even a link to start shopping for vehicles.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-launches-electric-vehicle-consumer-guide/,2021-07-06T14:07:19-07:00,"
Looking to help County residents who are thinking about buying an electric vehicle, the County of San Diego has created a new consumer guide website with information about benefits, costs, incentives — even a link to start shopping for vehicles.
The County’s Electric Vehicle (EV) Consumer Guide is the latest product of the EV Roadmap that the County’s Board of Supervisors approved in 2019 to build charging stations, encourage people to buy electric vehicles, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The County Board of Supervisors also voted in January to work with UC San Diego to create a strategy to move the region to zero-carbon emissions by 2035.
“Electric vehicles could help our region move toward that zero-emission goal,” County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher said. “And electric vehicles are not science fiction, they’re a viable option for people. This EV Consumer Guide website has all the information people need to help them decide if driving an electric car is the right option for them.”
The website gives people a single spot where they can get a wealth of information about a wide range of topics, including:

The environmental and financial benefits of owning a “zero-emission” vehicle, specific to the San Diego region.
The different types of zero-emission vehicles, which include all-electric vehicles powered by on-board batteries; plug-in hybrid-electric vehicles like Ford’s Escape PHEV that run primarily on electricity but have backup gas-powered systems; and hydrogen-cell vehicles.
Information about pre-owned electric vehicles.
A fuel-cost comparison calculator.
Locations of EV charging stations.
Permit requirements and information for installing charging stations for homes, apartments, condominiums, and businesses.
Links to financial incentives for buying a zero-emission vehicle.
Resources to understand vehicle models and different types of charging systems
A link to an interactive tool through Plugstar, a website created by the nonprofit Plug In America, to help consumers identify the zero-emission vehicle options that fit their needs — to match their budget, the number of miles they need to drive between charges, number of seats, etc.
Answers to frequently asked questions about electric vehicles.
A link to a vehicle search and comparison tool, also from Plugstar, where people can find the cars they want and the local dealers who carry them.

The County’s Department of Planning & Development Services developed the website to support the County’s commitment to increasing the numbers of electric cars on the road, to protect the public’s health and safety, sustain the environment in its climate action work and improve residents’ and visitors’ quality of life.
The EV Consumer Guide gives people one spot where they can find everything they need to know about buying an electric vehicle — without ever having to leave their garage.

652,"140,000 San Diegans Past Due for Second COVID-19 Shot","More than 140,000 San Diegans who have received their first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are overdue for their second dose, the County Health and Human Services Agency reports.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/140000-san-diegans-past-due-for-second-covid-19-shot/,2021-07-08T09:00:03-07:00,"
More than 140,000 San Diegans who have received their first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine are overdue for their second dose, the County Health and Human Services Agency reports. The recommended spacing of doses is three weeks for the Pfizer vaccine and four weeks for the Moderna vaccine.
A single dose of either vaccine is significantly less effective at protecting people from getting sick, especially against the new variants of the virus, and County health officials encourage those overdue to get vaccinated as soon as possible. Completing the full two-dose series of the vaccine is recommended, regardless of how long ago a person received their first shot.
“A single dose of those vaccines is only 33 percent effective against the more contagious delta variant of COVID-19, which has become the most prevalent strain of the virus in the United States and is likely to become more prevalent locally,” said Denise Foster, R.N., the County’s Chief Nursing Officer and COVID-19 Clinical Director. “San Diegans who are overdue for their second shot should take action as soon as possible to lower their risk of getting or spreading the virus.”
Everyone 12 years and older is eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine at no cost. Visit coronavirus-SD.com/vaccine for a full list of hours and locations of vaccine sites in the County.

653,All Registered Voters to Receive Mail Ballot for Gubernatorial Recall Election,The Registrar of Voters is alerting all active registered voters in San Diego County that they will receive a ballot in the mail for the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/all-registered-voters-to-receive-mail-ballot-for-gubernatorial-recall-election/,2021-07-08T13:57:53-07:00,"
The Registrar of Voters is alerting all active registered voters in San Diego County that they will receive a ballot in the mail for the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election.
Ballots will be mailed the week of Aug. 16, giving voters nearly a month to mark their ballot and return it before Election Day. Voters can return their ballot in the mail, no postage necessary, or at one of many mail ballot drop-off locations around the county.
Will there be in-person voting locations?
Yes. In-person voting locations will be open across the county for four days. From Saturday, Sept. 11 through Monday, Sept. 13 they will be open 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. On Election Day, the hours will change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. at both the in-person voting locations and the Registrar’s office.
Voters can also take advantage of early voting starting Aug. 16 at the Registrar’s office. Hours will run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday.
What do you need to do?
Be vote ready!

Check your voter registration information. Make sure your residence and, if different, your mailing address is up to date.
Have you moved or changed your name? Whether you are new to San Diego County or just moved down the street you need to re-register to vote.
Are you a first-time voter? If you want to participate in the upcoming election, you must be registered to vote – it takes less than 2 minutes.

What is a recall?
The recall process allows voters to decide whether to remove elected public officials from office before their term is over.
A recall ballot will ask voters two questions.
In this recall election, the first question will ask voters “yes” or “no” to remove the governor from office.
In the second part, voters will be asked to select a replacement candidate. If more than 50% of voters vote “yes” to recall the governor, the replacement candidate who gets the most votes is elected for the remainder of the term of office.
If a majority of voters vote “no” on the first question, then the recall has failed, and the governor will remain in office.

655,County Urges Unvaccinated to Ask Questions of Their Doctor,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is urging unvaccinated San Diegans who are hesitant or have questions about the vaccine to talk with their doctor and get vaccinated as soon as possible.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-urges-unvaccinated-to-ask-questions-of-their-doctor/,2021-07-09T16:57:44-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is urging San Diegans unvaccinated for COVID-19 and who are hesitant or have questions about the vaccine to talk with their doctor and get vaccinated as soon as possible.
The more contagious delta variant of the virus is on the rise in San Diego County and is expected to become the dominant strain by next month. To date, 54 cases of the delta variant have been identified in the county and 49 of them were in unvaccinated or not yet fully vaccinated San Diegans.
Along with the unvaccinated, people who have not completed two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine are not adequately protected against more contagious variants. Approximately 140,000 San Diegans are overdue for their second shot.
“One shot of the vaccine is not enough to protect people against this very contagious strain of the virus,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., County Chief Medical Officer. “Shot number two makes the difference when it comes to the delta variant, and I urge San Diegans who are overdue for their second dose to complete the series as soon as possible.”
Since COVID-19 vaccines became widely available in the county, the vast majority of cases, hospitalizations and deaths have been in unvaccinated San Diegans. From March 1 through July 6, 95 percent of COVID-19 cases, 98 percent of hospitalizations and 96 percent of deaths were in San Diegans who had not been fully vaccinated.
County health officials re-emphasized Friday that vaccines are safe, effective and free.
Dr. Hans Crumpler is a medical doctor with SharpCare in eastern San Diego County, where vaccine uptake is lower compared to the other parts of the region. Crumpler, who was infected with the virus himself and has seen the negative impact of the virus on his patients, regularly counsels those who are vaccine hesitant.
“The devastation this virus causes is preventable and everyone who is able to get the vaccine should get it as promptly as they can,” Crumpler said. “I beg you, please get your vaccine, come to your provider, ask questions if you have doubts, fear or hesitations. We’re here to help educate you.”

It’s a party! An all-day party, a 100-plus-one party — and everyone is invited.
Live Oak County Park in Fallbrook is turning 101 years old, and the County and Fallbrook are holding a free day-long celebration from 9 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Saturday, July 17.
The celebration will feature events — live reptile and birds of prey demonstrations, a “peeps and pooches” dog walk, the planting of two large live oak trees and a sunset showing of “Toy Story 4” — and fun activities including bounce houses, face-painting, a photo booth and climbing wall.
There will also be two food trucks with Mexican food fare and a giveaway of 100 1-gallon live oak trees grown from acorns gathered from the park.
And of course, visitors will also have the chance to enjoy Live Oak County Park itself. Dedicated in 1920, nestled among beautiful oak trees, the park has grown from 10 to 27 acres and into the heart of Fallbrook’s community, becoming a favorite spot for recreation, weddings, picnics and relaxation.
Visitors can still see grinding holes in the park’s bedrock where Native Americans ground acorns long before the park was dedicated. In recent years the park has added an amphitheater, native plant garden, play area, softball and soccer fields, volleyball and basketball courts, and exercise stations. In 2015, Live Oak County Park became the first in the County’s parks system to add an off-leash dog park, a 3,000 square-foot area with fencing, gates, tables, benches and pet waste stations where pets can frolic with their owners and other dogs.
County Parks and Recreation staff have been preparing the park for its “Centennial+1” celebration for the past year, adding new benches, replacing walkways, installing exercise equipment, improving the park’s restrooms, restoring two concrete tables that date back to the park’s opening and planting more than 100 additional native trees and shrubs.
The party’s schedule of events includes:

10 a.m. “Peeps and Pooches” walk
11:30 a.m. “Jumbo Tree Planting,” the planting of two 36” box live oak trees (visitors can pitch in to help, or just watch)
11:45 a.m. Live reptile demonstrations and animal touch tables
1 p.m. Face-painting, photo booth and balloon artists will run from 1 p.m. until the movie starts.
3:30 p.m. Raptors (birds of prey) demonstration
5 p.m. Bounce houses, climbing wall and an inflatable obstacle course will open as pre-movie events
7:30 p.m. Movie in the Park, “Toy Story 4”.

So come and celebrate. It’s not every year you get to celebrate a 100-plus-one party!

The Registrar of Voters is seeking temporary site managers to operate an assigned in-person voting location for the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election. Site managers earn $20 per hour and work approximately 125 hours over a five-week period.
For the upcoming election, in-person voting locations will be open for four days instead of one. The Registrar’s office will hire election workers rather than use volunteer poll workers because training is more extensive for the expanded time period.
Site managers will be required to train and lead election workers while representing the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner. The Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership skills and display flexibility, patience and the highest level of integrity at all times.
Site managers work up to three days a week during the pre-election weeks, attend training to learn procedures, tasks, and responsibilities, and train their election workers.

Site managers must be available to work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on assigned workdays but may be required to work more than eight hours a day and will work some weekends.
On Election Day, Sept. 14, site managers must work from 5:30 a.m. to 10 p.m.

The Registrar’s office is working with Public Health Services to ensure the health and safety of election workers and voters. Recommended personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies will be provided to workers so they can conduct the election process safely.
English speakers who are bilingual in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese or Chinese are also needed. If you are fluent in one of these languages, be sure to indicate it on your application.
Site manager applications are available online. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.

658,"County Board Accepts $24 Million for COVID-19 Response in High-Risk Populations, Receives Vaccine Survey Results",The County Board of Supervisors today received the results of a new local survey with details about why some are still hesitant to get vaccinated and approved an investment of $24 million in federal funds to support COVID-19 response in high-risk communities.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-board-accepts-24-million-for-covid-19-response-in-high-risk-populations-receives-vaccine-survey-results/,2021-07-13T16:27:35-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today received the results of a new local survey with details about why some are still hesitant to get vaccinated and approved an investment of $24 million in federal funds to support COVID-19 response in high-risk communities.
First, the Board received an update on COVID-19 rates in San Diego County.
The number of local COVID-19 cases has been rising the past few weeks, increasing the case rate from 1.9 cases per 100,000 residents on June 15 to 3.7 cases per 100,000 residents now. The daily case count increased to 355 on July 12 and has been at or above 200 for the last seven days.
“We are now seeing about double the number of cases that were being reported a month ago,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This has led to a 46% increase in hospitalizations and 10% uptake in intensive care unit admissions in the past few weeks. We expect further increases in ICU admissions since they lag behind the trend in cases and hospitalizations.”
COVID-19 variant cases also are increasing. Ten variants have been identified in the region, four of them having been designated as variants of concern, including the Delta variant. To date, 107 cases of the Delta variant have been reported in the region.
Vaccine Survey Findings 
The Board also received an update on the second countywide vaccine confidence survey. The survey was conducted between June 13 and 24 to determine the most common concerns among residents who are reluctant to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
The survey identified three focus areas:

County residents who received their first shot of the COVID-19 vaccine and are overdue for their second dose
Residents who are hesitant about getting the vaccine because they feel they do not have enough trusted information
San Diegans who are vaccine resistant

Residents who stated they were unlikely to get vaccinated were most concerned about potential side effects of the vaccines. Another common concern was that vaccine development was rushed.
The survey also showed a divide among race/ethnicity and gender lines. Close to half of the men who responded to the survey said they were likely to eventually get vaccinated, while only one-third of women planned to get vaccinated. About half of all respondents of color said they were likely to get the vaccine, while nearly two-thirds of white respondents said they were unlikely to do so.
The findings of the survey were shared with the medical community last week to better help physicians and providers address patient concerns surrounding vaccinations. The County is in the process of tailoring messaging, creating tools, and working with its partners to increase access to information in areas with low vaccination rates.
More Funding to Fight COVID-19
The Board also voted to accept more than $24 million in federal funds to address COVID-19 in high-risk populations and communities.
The funds from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be used to develop and implement strategies to improve the local COVID-19 response and prevention capacity through testing, tracing and vaccination in populations that are underserved and at high risk for COVID-19, including racial and ethnic minority groups and people living in rural communities.
The County COVID-19 Health Disparities Project, a collaboration with community partners and contracted service providers, will also help to improve public health data systems and access to health and social services, reduce health disparities and expand health equity in vulnerable populations and communities.
Additionally, the Board authorized the acceptance of $4.5 million in funding from the State to expand the Community Health Worker model to work with local community groups to provide COVID-19 vaccination assistance, communications and outreach.
The Board also took another step on a spending plan to provide housing, direct payments and legal assistance to people experiencing homelessness or are at risk of losing their home.
Another goal is to expand the Safe Haven transitional housing program in the City of San Diego, which is designed around the Board’s harm reduction strategies to reduce the negative consequences associated with drug use. The expansion of the program will cost about $4.6 million and calls for having three separate sites with up to 25 beds.
The County will also evaluate options to develop a plan to provide direct stimulus payments to children and youth living with foster care families.
Additionally, today’s action allows the County to expand by $10 million legal services for those facing eviction, and $5 million for coordinated eviction prevention services.
These actions align with the County’s Live Well San Diego vision by expanding critical behavioral health services to vulnerable populations and taking further action to continue to ensure people and families throughout the region have housing and other services to support their health and well-being.

660,County Board Adopts First Environmental Justice Element for General Plan,County Supervisors voted this week to adopt a first-ever Environmental Justice Element for the County’s general plan and heard updates on the County’s new Climate Action Plan and the regional zero-carbon plan they approved pursuing in January.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-board-adopts-first-environmental-justice-element-for-general-plan/,2021-07-15T13:21:37-07:00,"
County Supervisors voted Wednesday to adopt a first-ever Environmental Justice Element for the County’s general plan and heard updates on the County’s new Climate Action Plan and the regional zero-carbon plan they approved pursuing in January.
The County general plan guides community development in San Diego County’s unincorporated communities, setting the long-term vision for housing, jobs, infrastructure and public services.
The Board’s unanimous vote to adopt the new Environmental Justice Element will help ensure the County’s general plan promotes fair treatment for people of all races, cultures and incomes when it comes to having access to safe and livable communities, and opportunities for civic engagement.
The Environmental Justice Element will also help to improve underserved communities that are more prone than others to have environmental disadvantages, like more exposure to air and chemical pollution because of traffic or industry, fewer public facilities, infrastructure and services, and less access to healthy food and recreation.
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher applauded the addition and said a lot of positive passion and energy went into developing the Environmental Justice element.
“I think the EJ element is absolutely essential, and I think it’s important,” Fletcher said. “I think it’s a wonderful addition to (the general plan).”
Using County Live Well and state Environmental Protection Agency criteria, the new element currently identifies 17 census tracts in four unincorporated communities as environmental justice communities: north El Cajon, north Lemon Grove, Spring Valley and Sweetwater.
With the Board’s vote to adopt the Environmental Justice Element, County staff plan to continue stakeholder and public meetings to develop additional criteria to identify additional environmental justice communities.
Supervisors also voted Wednesday to update two of the general plan’s other seven elements, the housing and safety elements.
Climate Action Plan Update and Regional Zero-carbon Plan 
The Board of Supervisors also received updates on two related, but different climate-related plans Wednesday. The first was the County’s Climate Action Plan Update. The second was the regionwide decarbonization plan, called a Regional Decarbonization Framework, the Board voted to pursue in January to move the San Diego region toward zero carbon by 2035.
County staff said both plans would seek to reduce greenhouse gas and carbon emissions, focusing on both equity and zero-carbon goals, but they differ in scope and approval process.
The County’s Climate Action Plan Update will be designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions generated by anticipated future development in unincorporated San Diego County communities — the 772,000 acres over which the County has land-use authority — and from County operations. That plan can be approved by the County Board of Supervisors alone.
In contrast, the Regional Decarbonization Framework will affect the entire region, not just the unincorporated areas. That plan would require the County to work with, and have the participation of, other public agencies including cities, transportation agencies and school districts.
The County is working with the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy and the Energy Policy Initiatives Center at the University of San Diego School of Law to create a framework for its proposed regional zero-carbon plan. County staff said they’re also studying the best emissions reduction plans from across the nation. Staff members said Wednesday they expect to complete a draft framework for the regional effort in November and bring it to the Board for consideration in February.
Creating the Climate Action Plan  Update
To prepare the Climate Action Plan Update, County staff is collecting emissions data from five sectors throughout 2019 to establish a baseline from which reduction goals can be set and progress measured. The goal is to reach net-zero emissions by 2035-2045.
County Planning & Development Services staff have already started working on several aspects of the Climate Action Plan Update, processing emissions data to create the inventory, reviewing emissions-reduction measures and preparing an environmental study.
The department is also preparing to hold several more public workshops to gather community feedback, starting July 28. County staff estimate they will complete a draft plan next year. They expect to bring a completed Climate Action Plan and Supplemental Environmental Impact Report to the Board for consideration in winter 2022.
The County is currently continuing to implement many of the 26 greenhouse gas reduction measures that were in the County’s 2018 Climate Action Plan. The Board of Supervisors rescinded that plan in September 2020 after deciding not to further appeal a court ruling. That ruling and legal challenge, however, took no issue with the measures, which decreased carbon dioxide emissions by 160,743 metric tons, exceeding the County’s 2020 goal by 22%.

The California Gubernatorial Recall Election is fast approaching, and the Registrar of Voters is preparing election ballots for mailing. Voters are urged to check their voter registration now to get a mail ballot at their address later.
Mail ballots start going out the week of Aug. 16. If your information is up to date, you can expect your ballot in your mailbox that same week.
Have you moved since you last voted? Whether you are new to San Diego County or just moved down the street, you need to re-register to vote with your new information. You can do this by completing a new voter registration application online at sdvote.com. Registration forms are also available if you call (858) 565-5800 or email rovmail@sdcounty.ca.gov.
Mail ballots give voters the option to vote from the comfort of their homes. Voters can return their ballot in the mail, no postage necessary, or at one of many mail ballot drop-off locations around the county.
In-person voting locations will be open across the county for four days, Saturday, Sept. 11 – Tuesday, Sept. 14. Take advantage of early voting:

At the Registrar’s office beginning Aug. 16, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday

Voters will see two parts on their recall ballot. In the first part, voters have the option to vote “yes” or “no” to the question of whether to remove the Governor from office.
In the second part, voters have an opportunity to select a replacement candidate. If more than 50% of voters vote to recall the Governor, then the replacement candidate with the most votes would be elected.
First-time voter? You can register to vote in less than two minutes.

665,COVID-19 Cases in County Rise 82% in One Week,"The number of COVID-19 cases in San Diego has significantly increased in the past week, prompting County health officials to urge residents to continue getting vaccinated.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-cases-in-county-rise-82-in-one-week/,2021-07-21T16:59:14-07:00,"
The number of COVID-19 cases in San Diego has significantly increased in the past week, prompting County health officials to urge residents to continue getting vaccinated.
In the past seven days, 3,465 COVID-19 cases were reported in San Diego County. That’s 1,566 or 82% more cases than the previous seven-day period.
Hospitalizations due to COVID-19 are also trending up. The daily total rose above 100 on July 6 and has remained above that threshold since. Hospitalizations are likely to rise higher since they typically do after increases in cases.
The rise in cases and hospitalizations is occurring primarily in San Diegans who are not vaccinated. These individuals are also being disproportionately impacted by the Alpha, Gamma and Delta COVID-19 variants of concern.
“The best protection we have against COVID-19 is getting vaccinated,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccines are extremely effective at preventing serious illness from COVID-19. If you have not gotten immunized, do it now.”
There has also been a very slight increase in post-vaccination infections, meaning people got infected with COVID-19 even though they were fully vaccinated.
Wooten said that was expected and that breakthrough cases typically have mild symptoms.
“This does not mean the vaccine is not working. Quite the opposite, the vaccine is doing what it’s supposed to do: keep most people from being hospitalized, or worse, dying,” Wooten said.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: More than to 4.19 million.
Received at least one shot: Almost 2.25 million or 80.2% of San Diegans 12 and older are partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 1.94 million or 69.2%.
The goal: vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 12 and older or 2,101,936 people, with at least one dose.
To date, 106.9% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 92.3% are fully vaccinated.
More vaccination information can be found coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

One new death was reported between July 14 and July 20. The region’s total is 3,787.
A man in his 60s and with underlying medical conditions died June 12.

Cases, Case Rate and Testing:

521 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on July 21. The region’s total is now 288,681.
San Diego County’s case rate is 7.6 cases per 100,000 residents as of July 20.
7,895 tests were reported to the County on July 20, and the percentage of new positive cases was 6.6%.
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases among tests is 5.1%.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

22 new community outbreaks were confirmed in the past seven days (July 14 through July 20): 10 in restaurant/bar settings, four in business settings, two in day camp settings, one in a campground setting, one in a restaurant setting, one in a construction setting, one in a government setting, one in a retail setting and one in a faith-based setting.
The community outbreaks trigger is more than seven in a 7-day period.

667,"Significant Spike in COVID-19 Cases, San Diegans Need to Get Vaccinated Now",The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is seeing a significant spike in new COVID-19 cases.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/significant-spike-in-covid-19-cases-san-diegans-need-to-get-vaccinated-now/,2021-07-23T13:00:10-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is seeing a significant spike in new COVID-19 cases. The County will report 1,264 new cases this afternoon, the highest number since February 5, 2021.
The increase in cases is not a single-day phenomenon, but part of a larger trend in recent weeks. In the 30 days between June 21 and July 20, 6,572 San Diegans tested positive for COVID-19. Of that group, 11 percent were fully vaccinated, while 89 percent were not.
Community outbreaks, hospitalizations and ICU admissions are also up dramatically. The County will post an additional two community outbreaks today, bringing the total number of outbreaks in the last seven days to 25. One month ago, on June 23, only five community outbreaks were reported.
Higher Risk for Unvaccinated
A total of 98 percent of hospitalizations in the last 30 days are in individuals who are not vaccinated or have not completed the full series of the two-dose vaccine.
“The vaccines are effective in preventing severe illness or death from COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If you have not gotten vaccinated, the time to get vaccinated is now. If you are late for your second dose, the time to get that second shot is now.”
“In the last few weeks, individuals who were not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 were seven times more likely to contract the virus,” said Seema Shah, M.D., medical director of HHSA’s Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch. “The more infectious Delta variant is on its way to becoming the dominant strain among San Diego County residents and a single dose of the vaccine is only about 30 percent effective in protecting people from getting sick.”
Close to 150,000 San Diegans are only partially vaccinated and overdue for their second shot. The County is working with medical providers to help them remind patients and is also using the San Diego Immunization Registry to develop follow-up reminders for those who are behind schedule.
To facilitate access to COVID-19 vaccines, the County is now operating the Great Eight, a collection of geographically distributed no-cost vaccination sites that allow people to choose any one of the three vaccines available in the United States, Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.

668,Masks Not Required Indoors for Vaccinated; COVID-19 Vaccinations Encouraged,The County of San Diego continues to follow California Department of Public Health guidelines which require indoor masking of unvaccinated individuals and masking of everyone in certain settings,https://www.countynewscenter.com/masks-not-required-indoors-for-vaccinated-covid-19-vaccinations-encouraged/,2021-07-26T17:11:16-07:00,"
While some counties in the state are requiring masks indoors regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status, the County of San Diego continues to follow California Department of Public Health guidelines which require indoor masking of unvaccinated individuals and masking of everyone in certain settings.
County health officials say getting vaccinated is the most important step to prevent the spread of COVID-19, move the economy forward, reduce risk to the vulnerable and get back to our pre-pandemic way of life.
“COVID-19 is now the pandemic of the unvaccinated,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Get vaccinated now especially since cases and hospitalizations have been going up.”
State guidelines permit business to require masks for anyone indoors whether people are vaccinated or not. County health officials say San Diegans who feel uncomfortable around others should wear a mask if they want to.
“Even though I am fully vaccinated, I still wear a mask in public,” said Eric McDonald, M.D., M.P.H., County chief medical officer. “People should take whatever precautions they want to prevent getting and spreading COVID-19, especially if they live with someone who is not able to get vaccinated or is immunocompromised.”
Ninety-eight percent of hospitalizations in the last 30 days are in people who are not vaccinated or have not completed the full series of the two-dose vaccine.
Additionally, about 150,000 San Diegans are only partially vaccinated and overdue for their second shot.
“One dose of the vaccine does not give you enough immunity to prevent getting COVID-19, especially the Delta variant,” Wooten said. “Getting both doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine gives you the best protection against all COVID-19 variants that are currently circulating.”
Another 2,044 COVID-19 cases and 55 hospitalizations were reported from Friday to Sunday (July 23-25). The number of community outbreaks is now at 27 after 12 more were confirmed over the past three days.
The County is working with medical providers to help them remind patients and is also using the San Diego Immunization Registry to develop follow-up reminders for those who are behind schedule with their second dose.
To facilitate access to COVID-19 vaccines, the County is now operating the Great Eight, a collection of geographically distributed no-cost vaccination sites that allow people to choose any one of the three vaccines available in the United States, Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.

The Registrar of Voters still needs temporary election workers for the California Gubernatorial Recall Election on Tuesday, Sept. 14. Election workers can earn up to $20 an hour.
There is a particular need for election workers to manage the operations of mail ballot drop-off locations and site managers for in-person voting locations around the county.
The mail ballot drop-off locations will be open for nearly a month and in-person voting locations will be open for four days instead of one. The Registrar’s office will hire election workers rather than use volunteer poll workers because training is more extensive for the expanded time period.
The Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership skills and display flexibility, patience, and the highest level of integrity at all times. Election workers must represent the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner.
English speakers who are bilingual in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese or Chinese are also needed. If you are fluent in one of these languages, be sure to indicate it on your application.
The Registrar’s office is working with Public Health Services to ensure the health and safety of election workers and voters. Recommended personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies will be provided to workers so they can conduct the election process safely.
Applications are available online. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.

670,"VIDEO: Cool Zones, Free Fans Can Help San Diegans Beat the Heat","The County of San Diego is reminding San Diegans that Cool Zones are available throughout the region to help them beat the heat this summer. The County operates 16 Cool Zones at various locations, including libraries, recreation centers and senior centers across the region.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/cool-zones-free-fans-can-help-san-diegans-beat-the-heat/,2021-07-28T15:50:19-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is reminding San Diegans that Cool Zones are available throughout the region to help them beat the heat this summer. The County operates 16 Cool Zones at various locations, including libraries, recreation centers and senior centers across the region.
Cool Zones are free, air-conditioned locations where people can go to cool down. Some of the locations are operating with extended or weekend hours.
Hot temperatures can be particularly dangerous for seniors and children, and they are advised to seek shelter in cool locations when temperatures rise. Working or exercising outside on a hot day, or staying too long in an overheated place can cause heat-related illnesses, including cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke.
An extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion, and headache are signs of heatstroke or exhaustion. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the person immediately.
People who are homebound, lack transportation, or decide to stay home due to the risk of COVID-19, may not be able to take advantage of traditional Cool Zone sites.
To help these community members beat the heat, the County of San Diego, in partnership with SDG&E, provides free electric fans to those who are living on limited incomes.
To be eligible for the fan program, a County resident must not have access to an air-conditioned space at their home or apartment building. To learn more about the Cool Zones Fan Program or to request a fan, call Aging & Independence Services at 800-339-4661.

671,"70% of San Diegans Vaccinated, COVID Continues Spread in Unvaccinated","San Diego is continuing to make progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported Wednesday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/70-of-san-diegans-vaccinated-covid-continues-spread-in-unvaccinated/,2021-07-28T17:05:48-07:00,"
San Diego is continuing to make progress on COVID-19 vaccinations, with 70% of residents 12 and older now fully vaccinated, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported Wednesday. More than 81% of County residents have received at least one shot.
“This is turning into the pandemic of the unvaccinated, so I want to thank San Diegans for responding to our call to get vaccinated,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The more contagious Delta variant is on the rise and being fully vaccinated affords the best protections against the disease.”
While the vaccination percentage is on the rise, new COVID-19 infections continue to increase as well, mostly in unvaccinated San Diegans. In the last 30 days – June 28 to July 27 – 11,391 people tested positive for COVID-19. Of those, close to 90%, or 10,234, were not vaccinated and 10%, or 1,157 people, were vaccinated.
New Masking Recommendation
The County of San Diego will follow the latest guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in recommending the universal wearing of masks by both vaccinated and unvaccinated people in indoor public settings.
Indoor masking of unvaccinated people has been required since the end of the state’s Blueprint for a Safer Economy, and they have been required for everyone in certain settings including health care locations. The recommendation to wear a facial covering indoors, regardless of vaccination status, comes in light of new data that shows that the Delta variant is much more transmissible than previous strains of COVID-19. The new variant is expected to primarily strike the unvaccinated and also lead to an increase in cases in vaccinated individuals.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: More than 4.24 million.
Received at least one shot: Over 2.27 million or 81.1% of San Diegans 12 and older are partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 1.96 million or 70%.
The goal: vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 12 and older or 2,101,936 people, with at least one dose.
To date, 108.1% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 93.3% are fully vaccinated.
More vaccination information can be found coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Eleven new deaths were reported since the last report on July 21. The region’s total is 3,798.
Two women and nine men died between December 24, 2020 and July 22, 2021.
Four of the deceased were in their 80s, two in their 70s, two in their 60s, two in their 50s and one was in their 40s.
Ten of the deceased had underlying medical conditions and one person did not have any underlying conditions.

Cases, Case Rate and Testing:

765 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on July 27. The region’s total is now 294,176.
San Diego County’s case rate is 13.4 cases per 100,000 residents as of July 27.
10,090 tests were reported to the County on July 27, and the percentage of new positive cases was 7.6%.
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases among tests is 7.1%.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

30 new community outbreaks were confirmed in the past seven days (July 21 through July 27): eight in restaurant/bar settings, six in business settings, three in TK-12 school settings, two in a hotel/resort/spa setting, two in retail settings, one in a daycare/preschool/childcare setting, one in a distribution warehouse setting, one in an emergency services setting, one in a faith-based setting, one in a fitness/gym setting, one in a government setting, one in a grocery setting, one in a health care setting and one in a restaurant setting.

County and local health leaders today highlighted the work being done by the Eliminate Hepatitis C San Diego County Initiative as part of World Hepatitis Day.
Established in Nov. 2018, the Eliminate Hepatitis C San Diego County Initiative is an effort to reduce new infections of hepatitis C by 80% and deaths by 65% by 2030.
In San Diego County, about 3,400 hepatitis C cases are reported each year. Also, there are about 54,000 San Diegans who have the viral infection but do not know it.
Hepatitis C, for which there is no vaccine, is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus, different from the viruses that cause hepatitis A and B.
The virus typically goes unnoticed since most people who contract it will not show symptoms until they develop long-term complications. Acute hepatitis C typically occurs within six months of exposure and symptoms include fever, fatigue, dark urine, nausea, vomiting and jaundice.

Three San Diego County parks will be closed for the month of August starting Sunday, a measure taken each year because of the month’s typically high temperatures.
Parks officials announced that El Capitan Preserve near Lakeside, Hellhole Canyon Preserve in Valley Center and Mt. Gower Preserve in Ramona will be closed.
The County previously closed Agua Caliente Regional Park and Vallecito County Park in the Anza Borrego desert for the summer, to reopen Labor Day weekend.
In addition to protecting the public from extreme temperatures, the closures give Department of Parks and Recreation staff the opportunity to conduct maintenance such as trail restoration.
There are more than 100 other County parks and preserves to explore during the month of August. Take in the views from the County’s newest trail in the South Bay, stay the night in one of the new cabins at Dos Picos County Park in Ramona, visit a butterfly garden at Lindo Lake County Park in Lakeside, or enjoy a free Summer Movies in the Park screening at dusk after it cools off. If it is really hot, plan your next hike by take one of these virtual tours of a County park.
Parks staff urged people to always take precautions when they’re outside in high temperatures.
If you do go out for a hike, be smart. Below are some safety tips hikers should consider before hitting the trails:

Let someone know where you will be and when you plan to return.
Hike with others, never alone.
Leave your dog at home for difficult hikes. Even “easy” hikes may be too much for your dog when the air or ground are too hot.
Take plenty of water to stay hydrated. Rangers recommends one liter (about a quart) for every 2 to 3 miles.
Wear sunscreen, a hat and sunglasses.
Take breaks in shade, if possible.
Take a fully charged mobile phone, map and/or GPS.
Wear lightweight, light-colored, ventilated clothing.
Bring along a warm jacket if you plan to stay out after dusk.
Wear sturdy shoes with traction for slippery rocks.
Follow all posted safety rules.
Bring ample food, sunscreen to reapply, a flashlight, first aid kit, multi-purpose tool and a whistle.
Know your limitations; choose trails that match your level of physical fitness and areas where you are not going to get lost.

676,"San Diegans Now Primarily Vaccinated at Pharmacies, Community Clinics",San Diegans have largely turned to traditional vaccination clinics to get immunized against COVID-19.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-now-primarily-vaccinated-at-pharmacies-community-clinics/,2021-07-30T15:59:17-07:00,"
San Diegans have largely turned to traditional vaccination clinics to get immunized against COVID-19.
Retail pharmacies are now the primary provider of vaccines, administering over 100,000 doses from July 1 through July 28. They were followed, in order, by community clinics (nearly 20,000 doses), private medical providers (almost 17,000 doses), County sites (about 13,000 doses) and hospitals (just under 9,000 doses) during the same time frame.
“I want to thank every San Diegan who has been vaccinated and the many partners working daily with the County to ensure vaccines are readily available in every part of our region,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Masking and other public health guidance are additional measures to help us safely navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccinations are our key for getting out of it.”
The County has been working with its vaccination partners to get the word out to San Diegans who are hesitant about getting immunized.
To date, about 2.28 million or 81.4% of the 2.8 million San Diegans eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine have received a first dose and about 1.97 million or 70.3% are fully vaccinated.
“I want to thank all of our community and health care partners who have been doing a great job getting the word out about how important it is to get vaccinated,” Wooten said.
COVID-19 Cases, Hospitalizations Up
In the past month, the local COVID-19 case rate has jumped from 2.1 to 19.3 cases per 100,000 residents. Hospitalizations have also increased more than 300% and intensive care unit admissions rose by over 120% during that same period.
On July 29, a total of 1,273 cases were reported, the highest daily total since Feb. 5, 2021.
The spike in cases drove the County to recommend mask-wearing indoors for all San Diegans regardless of vaccination status.
“Unvaccinated people are overwhelmingly the ones getting infected and being hospitalized,” Wooten said. “If you have not gotten your COVID-19 vaccine, do it now.”
The County is helping medical providers contact all San Diegans who are partially vaccinated to get their second shot, especially now that COVID-19 cases have been going up, a spike driven primarily by the Delta variant.

677,Monthly Mosquito Larvicide Application Done by Hand Crews This Week,"County Vector Control crews will conduct their regular mosquito-fighting larvicide applications this week on dozens of local waterways — but by hand, rather than from the air, because the helicopter used is down for unscheduled maintenance.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/monthly-mosquito-larvicide-application-done-by-hand-crews-this-week/,2021-08-02T11:40:48-07:00,"
County Vector Control crews will conduct their regular mosquito-fighting larvicide applications this week on dozens of local waterways — but by hand, rather than from the air, because the helicopter used is down for unscheduled maintenance.
The County has used helicopters to drop batches of solid, granular larvicide on nearly 50 rivers, streams, ponds and other waterways in summer months since the early 2000s. The program keeps mosquito populations down and protects people from mosquito-borne illnesses like West Nile virus.
This week they’ll be doing the same thing, but without the helicopter.
Residents in the areas covered may see County crews wearing Vector Control uniforms that clearly identify them applying larvicide by hand, or using equipment such as backpack leaf-blower-like applicators and some vehicle mounted applicators to disperse the larvicide. Some of the waterways will be accessed by crews in boats. The larvicide doesn’t hurt people, pets, or other animals but is deadly for mosquito larvae and keeps them from growing into biting adult mosquitoes.
The application is typically done over the course of two days by helicopter, roughly once a month from April through September or October. Because crews will be working from the ground this month’s application is expected to take approximately six days, starting Monday.
West Nile virus’s effect has been mild in San Diego County in recent years, with just one person testing positive for it in 2020 and three in 2019 — all of whom contracted the virus outside the county — with no fatalities. To date for 2021, there have been no local detections of the virus through routine surveillance activities.
However, West Nile virus remains a potentially dangerous disease; 22 county residents tested positive for it in 2016 and two people died. Last year across California, 258 people tested positive and 11 people died.
West Nile virus is mainly a bird disease, but it can be transmitted to people and some animals like horses by mosquitoes that first feed on infected birds and then a person or animal.
Public has important role to play
Protecting against mosquitoes has required more help from the public in recent years because of the appearance of a number of types of invasive Aedes mosquitoes that can potentially transmit diseases not naturally found here, including Zika, dengue and chikungunya. While native culex mosquitoes that can transmit West Nile virus breed in larger water bodies reached by the County’s larvicide drops, invasive Aedes mosquitoes prefer to live and breed around people’s homes and yards.
County Vector Control officials said the best way people can protect themselves from mosquitoes is to follow their “Prevent, Protect, Report” guidelines.
Prevent mosquito breeding
San Diego County residents may be more vulnerable to being bitten by mosquitoes around their homes now because many have been spending more time at home during the coronavirus pandemic. So, remember to dump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as stagnant swimming pools, ponds, fountains and horse troughs.
Protect yourself from mosquito bites
Protect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use insect repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.
Report possible mosquito activity and dead birds
Report increased mosquito activity, or stagnant, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds within 24 hours — dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls — to the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality’s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov. Also report if you are being bitten by mosquitoes during daylight hours, or if you find mosquitoes that look like invasive Aedes mosquitoes — small, black with white stripes on legs and backs — by contacting the Vector Control Program at (858) 694-2888.

680,Over 2 Million San Diegans Now Fully Vaccinated,"More than 2 million San Diegans are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, placing the County closer to achieving its vaccination goal.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/over-2-million-san-diegans-now-fully-vaccinated/,2021-08-04T16:55:05-07:00,"
More than 2 million San Diegans are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19, placing the County closer to achieving its vaccination goal.
The County reached the milestone over the weekend and by Aug. 3, a total of 2,015,700, or 71.9%, of residents 12 and older had received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson shot.
“Great job, San Diegans!” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The more people who get vaccinated the closer we will be to achieving our vaccination goal.”
The County had set a goal of vaccinating 75% of the 2.8 million residents who are eligible to get the vaccine, which comes out to 2,101,936 people. About 86,000 more San Diegans are needed to reach that target, which is five percentage points higher than the state and national goal.
“We’re confident we’ll achieve that goal,” Wooten said, adding that there are more than 284,000 San Diegans who are partially vaccinated. “However, we must keep going if we want to prevent the spread of COVID-19, move the economy forward and get back to our pre-pandemic way of life.”
There’s plenty of COVID-19 vaccine in the region. You can find it at doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County sites for people with no medical provider. For a list of locations and more information, visit  www.coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

681,Citrus Disease Detection in San Diego County Prompts Quarantine,"The California Department of Food and Agriculture declared a quarantine in parts of north San Diego County Thursday, after detecting a potentially devastating citrus disease in the county for the first time.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/citrus-disease-detection-in-san-diego-county-prompts-quarantine/,2021-08-06T08:10:26-07:00,"
The California Department of Food and Agriculture declared a quarantine in parts of north San Diego County Thursday, after detecting a potentially devastating citrus disease in the county for the first time.
The bacterial disease, known as Huanglongbing or “citrus greening,” was detected in two citrus trees on a residential property in Oceanside. The disease is not harmful to people but is deadly to citrus and could be devastating to the county’s citrus industry. Huanglongbing  is spread by tiny insects, the Asian citrus psyllid, if they are carrying the bacterium when they feed on citrus plants and trees.
California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) officials said the 60-square-mile quarantine area will prohibit people and businesses from moving citrus nursery stock, plant parts and fruit outside the quarantine boundaries, with the exception of commercially cleaned and packed fruit that adhere to specific requirements. The quarantine also prohibits people from moving residential citrus plants and plant parts off the properties on which they are grown.
The quarantine area is bordered on the north by Vandergrift Boulevard; on the south by Carlsbad Village Drive; on the west by the Pacific Ocean; and on the east by Melrose Drive.
“Unfortunately, Huanglongbing is fatal to citrus,” said San Diego Agricultural Commissioner Ha Dang, “so our goal is to stop this from spreading any farther. By working together, we can all protect San Diego County’s $150 million citrus industry from this deadly disease.”
The California Department of Food and Agriculture  (CDFA), the United States Department of Agriculture and San Diego County’s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM) are working together on the quarantine. Work includes treating the residential location where the disease was found, establishing the quarantine boundaries and notifying businesses and residents within the quarantine area.
CDFA and AWM will coordinate informational meetings for commercial growers, nurseries and residents in the quarantine area. AWM will have information available on its website with links to Google translator that can translate the information into multiple languages.
Dang said this was a critical time for homeowners to protect their backyard citrus trees by searching for evidence of the Asian citrus psyllid and the disease.
Huanglongbing affects the vascular system of citrus trees and plants. Once a tree is infected, it cannot be saved and will die within a few years.

Huanglongbing symptoms include blotchy yellowing of leaves, yellow shoots, lopsided, small and rancid-tasting fruit, and premature, excessive fruit drop. If people are not sure if their plants are infected, they can contact the CDFA “Report-a-Pest” hotline at 1-800-491-1899.
Inside the quarantine area, CDFA urged residents to take the following steps:

Do not move citrus plants, leaves or foliage into or out of the quarantine area.
Cooperate with agricultural officials who are placing traps, inspecting trees and treating for the pest.
If you no longer wish to care for your citrus tree, consider removing it so it does not become a host to the pest and disease.

Inspectors first found the Asian citrus psyllid in San Diego County in 2008. But this is the first time they have found Huanglongbing disease. There are existing Huanglongbing quarantine areas in parts of Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where more than 2,400 trees have tested positive for the disease and been removed.
Commercial growers in the quarantine area can contact Sandra Zwaal at szwaal2@gmail.com for more information. Zwaal is the Asian Citrus Psyillid Huanglongbing Grower liaison for the California Citrus Pest & Disease Prevention Program, which is primarily funded by California growers and CDFA. Zwaal will also be working with the San Diego County Farm Bureau and San Diego County Pest Control District.
Nurseries and retail businesses that sell citrus should contact CDFA Environmental Scientist Jemellee Urbino at Jemellee.Urbino@cdfa.ca.gov for more information.
Maps of the quarantine area and updated information can be found on CDFA’s website Please check this link for future quarantine expansions, should they occur.

Televisions, radios and some cellphones will receive a test message as part of a nationwide emergency alert systems test on Wednesday, Aug. 11.
As in previous emergency alert systems tests, there is no need for concern for cellphone users or anyone viewing the alerts on television or hearing the tone on the radio, and there is no action that needs to be taken.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission will test its Emergency Alert System with television and radio channels between 11:20 and 11:50 a.m. Some consumer cellphones whose subscribers opted into the Wireless Emergency Alerts tests will also receive the special tone and test message.
In a real situation, the emergency alert systems would be used to warn the public about dangerous weather, missing children, or another critical situation that may require you to evacuate or remain in place.
Wireless Emergency Alerts can be sent by the National Weather Service, local first responder agencies, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and the president through a system devised by FEMA and the Federal Communications Commission.

688,Agriculture Tops $1.8 Billion in New Crop Report,"Agriculture values topped $1.8 billion for the first time since 2014 in the County of San Diego’s annual Crop Report that covers the 2020 growing season, overcoming decreases in many crop values and reported mixed effects of the coronavirus pandemic.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/agriculture-tops-1-8-billion-in-new-crop-report/,2021-08-12T09:36:11-07:00,"
Agriculture values topped $1.8 billion for the first time since 2014 and just the third time in 30 years in the County of San Diego’s annual Crop Report that covers the 2020 growing season, overcoming decreases in many crop values and reported mixed effects of the coronavirus pandemic.
The total value of all agriculture crops and commodities rose just 0.8% in the new Crop Report. But that was enough to push total values from $1,795,528,573 in 2019 to $1,810,326,411.
It was the fourth time in the past five Crop Reports that overall agriculture values increased, and the third time since 1990 that total values topped $1.8 billion in San Diego County. Values exceeded $1.8 billion in both 2013 and 2014.
The overall increase in 2020 was boosted by gains from the two largest groups of crops grown in the county — Nursery & Cut Flower Products, which account for 70% of all crop values; and Fruit & Nut Crops, which account for 19% of all crop values.
Nursery & Cut Flower Products increased 2%, from $1.25 billion to $1.27 billion. Fruit & Nut Crops increased 0.7%, from roughly $342 million to $344 million.
A smaller agriculture group, Forest Products, which includes timber and firewood, increased 1.5% from $855,154 in 2019 to $868,398.
But the other four crop groups decreased ­— Vegetable & Vine Crops, Field Crops, Apiary Products and Livestock and Poultry.
The largest of those groups, Vegetable & Vine crops, which account for 7% of total agriculture values, decreased 6.3%, from roughly $131 million to $122 million. It marked the fourth decline for Vegetable & Vine crops in the past five reports.
The report stated that the effects of the coronavirus pandemic appeared to be mixed. Some growers reported labor shortages and business closures; others suggested the people staying home because of the pandemic may have increased demand for items such as bedding plants, perennials, and indoor flowering and foliage plants.
Among the individual crops, the county’s king of the annual Top 10 list continued to be Ornamental Trees & Shrubs despite a 3% decrease in total value.
Ornamental Trees & Shrubs decreased from $445 million in 2019 to $432 million, but still edged out the number two crop, Bedding Plants, Color & Herbaceous Perennials, Cacti & Succulents, at $431.8 million.
San Diego County’s most well-known crop, Avocados, remained in fourth place on the Top 10 list, increasing in value in 2020 by 9.2%, from nearly $140 million to nearly $153 million, after increasing nearly 16% in 2019.
The rest of the Top 10 crops remained relatively similar to past years. Oranges and Livestock and Poultry exchanged places, with Oranges falling from the seventh spot to eight, and Livestock and Poultry rising from eight to seven.
The annual Crop Report is compiled by the County’s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures and can be seen online. The report provides a yearly snapshot of an industry that remains a staple of the region’s economy despite challenges like drought, rising water costs, fires, freezes, pests and the pandemic.
San Diego County’s Board of Supervisors has taken several actions over the years to boost agriculture, including creating a boutique winery ordinance to promote the creation of small wineries; approving a beekeeping ordinance that allows more beekeeping while protecting the public; adopting an agricultural easement program that preserves agricultural space; and streamlining regulations for things like cheese-making, agritourism and onsite horticultural sales.
Last year, the Board unanimously voted to help growers by deferring fees for export certification, direct marketing, and hazardous materials inventory, allowing growers use those funds for operation needs during the pandemic.
Supervisor Jim Desmond represents the County’s Fifth supervisorial district, which is home to a lot of the county’s agricultural land.
“During the pandemic, we have seen how essential farming is in San Diego County,” Desmond said. “Despite a difficult past 16 months for everyone, it’s great to see farming thriving. It is an honor to be the supervisor of District Five, which has a diverse variety of agricultural crops ranging from flowers to strawberries and avocados!”
Other highlights from the report include:

Wine grapes decreased in total value by nearly 7%, from roughly 5.6% million to $5.2 million, after posting 21.5%, 19% and 28% gains the previous three years.
At $431 million, Bedding Plants, Color & Herbaceous Perennials, Cacti & Succulents accounted for 24% of the region’s total agriculture production.
The 9.2% increase in avocado’s value was fueled in part by a 46% increase in yield.
Although total citrus values decreased by 3%, grapefruit crop values increased by 14%.

689,County Permit Refunds Provide More Pandemic Assistance to Restaurants,"The County will begin notifying restaurants today of $4.5 million in permit fee refunds for the period of March 16, 2020 through June 15, 2021.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-permit-refunds-provide-more-pandemic-assistance-to-restaurants/,2021-08-12T15:11:47-07:00,"
The County will begin notifying restaurants today of $4.5 million in permit fee refunds for the period of March 16, 2020 through June 15, 2021. The amount, which is the result of a recent settlement in a lawsuit brought by a local restaurant group, is in addition to $118.9 million already provided to restaurants by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors to help offset the impact of California’s stay-at-home and local public health orders.
More information on the 640 Tenth LP v. County of San Diego, et al. case and settlement can be found here.
“Restaurant owners and their employees suffered significant losses because of COVID-19. As the industry rebuilds, this refund will aid restaurants in their economic recovery and is in addition to the tens of millions of dollars provided to them during the height of the pandemic,” said Nathan Fletcher, Chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “To help restaurants recover and ensure we can continue to move San Diego County forward, everyone who has not received the vaccine should get it. The economic recovery of restaurants and other businesses depend on it.”
Sarah Aghassi of the County’s Land Use & Environment Group added, “The restaurant industry is a valued and important part of our local economy, and it has been seriously impacted by the pandemic closures. We look forward to maintaining our partnership as we move forward with our economic recovery.”
To date, the County has provided $123.4 million to specifically help restaurants. This includes:
$12 million from County fee-related actions supporting restaurants: 

March 24, 2020 – Deferred health permit fees through Sept. 1, 2020 for food facilities negatively impacted by the March 16, 2020 Local Health Officer and Emergency COVID-19 Regulations and the California Stay-at-Home Order.
October 27, 2020 – Extended the deferral of annual health permit fees, plan check fees, and late fees for restaurants and food facilities through March 31, 2021.
April 7, 2021 – No increases for Department of Environmental Health & Quality fees for fiscal year 2021-22 and funding to offset the needed increases proposed.
May 5, 2021 – Waived health permit fees for all restaurants and limited food preparation facilities for fiscal year 2021-22.

$90.2 million to fund the Great Plates program that partnered with restaurants during the pandemic to deliver meals to participating seniors from May 2020 through July 30, 2021.
$4.5 million from the lawsuit settlement: 
June 8, 2021 – Agreed to a class action lawsuit settlement (640 Tenth LP v. County of San Diego, et al.) for all restaurants and limited food preparation facilities in the County of San Diego that paid or were required to pay annual permit fees to the County of San Diego Department of Environmental Health and Quality from March 16, 2020 through June 15, 2021.

This provides a 50% refund of annual permit fees to restaurants that paid, and 50% credit to those that owe annual permit fees.  It also waives late fees for untimely payment of permit fees that were due from March 16, 2020 through June 15, 2021, as long as the fees are paid within 12 months of the original due date or by December 31, 2021, whichever is sooner.

$16.72 million in support was provided to restaurants and limited food preparation facilities through Small Business Stimulus Grant program.
The County of San Diego is committed to supporting the region’s ongoing economic recovery and is working with stakeholders to find different ways to support the business community.

More than 1.9 million ballots are on their way to San Diego County registered voters for the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election. You may find yours in your mailbox as early as Monday, Aug. 16. You will also find your “I Voted” sticker inside your official mail ballot packet.
Early voting is also underway at the Registrar of Voters office in Kearny Mesa. Hours run from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. However, the Registrar urges voters to take advantage of the convenience of voting by mail.
“We encourage voters to act early and vote from the comfort of their home,” said Interim Registrar of Voters Cynthia Paes. “Sign, seal, and return your mail ballot to a trusted source. The sooner we receive your ballot, the sooner we can start processing it so it will be counted right when the polls close at 8 p.m. on election night.”
You can return your marked ballot in the pre-paid postage envelope to any U.S. Postal Service office or collection box. Voters who return their mail ballot through the U.S. Postal Service can track it by signing up for “Where’s My Ballot?”.
Starting Tuesday, Aug. 17, you’ll also have the option of dropping off your ballot at one of 131 mail ballot drop-off locations around the county.
In-person voting locations
In addition to mail ballots, 221 in-person voting locations will be open across the county for four days, Saturday, Sept. 11 – Tuesday, Sept. 14. Take advantage of early voting:

Now, at the Registrar’s office 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday
At a voting location near you or the Registrar’s office Saturday, Sept. 11 through Monday, Sept. 13, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.

All again will be open on Election Day, Sept. 14, when hours change to 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
This election, all in-person voters will mark their ballot on a ballot marking device. This device does not store, tabulate or count any votes. After the voter confirms their selection on the device, the voter will print their ballot, review it, and place it in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar’s office election night.
Why are we having a recall election?  The recall process allows voters to decide whether to remove elected public officials from office before their term is over. California is one of 19 states that allows any elected official to be recalled from office.
The ballot will ask voters two questions:
1) Do you want to recall the governor?
2) If recalled, who do you want to replace him?
You can vote on either one or both parts of the recall ballot. If more than 50% of voters vote to recall the governor, then the replacement candidate with the most votes would be elected.

693,"Score Padre Tickets, T-shirts for Getting COVID-19 Vaccine","For the third time, the Padres and County are teaming up for a vaccination event at Petco Park, this one set for Tuesday, Aug. 24.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/score-padre-tickets-t-shirts-for-getting-covid-19-vaccine/,2021-08-17T09:37:23-07:00,"
Want to get a free pair of Padres tickets and a Padres Hero T-shirt?
For the third time, the Padres and County are teaming up for a vaccination event at Petco Park, this one set for Tuesday, Aug. 24.
The first 150 people who get vaccinated at Gallagher Square in Petco Park will receive a free pair of tickets to the Sept. 8 game against the Los Angeles Angels along with a commemorative T-shirt.
The vaccination clinic will take place as the Padres host a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. The clinic runs from 1 to 5 p.m. for everyone, and from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. for those with tickets to that evening’s game. The entrance is at the 9th & J gate with no-cost parking available between 1-3 p.m. at the Padres Parkade, 440 11th Avenue (vouchers are provided after the vaccination).
First and second shots will be administered, and an unlimited supply of all three vaccines will be available. The tickets and T-shirts are available to everyone vaccinated, regardless of whether it is a first or second shot.
“While San Diegans have done a great job getting vaccinated, we need even more people to be immunized so that we can slow the spread of COVID-19, especially now that the Delta variant is taking hold in our communities,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. “Get vaccinated so that we can knock COVID-19 out of the county.”
This is the third time the County has teamed up with the Padres to vaccinate San Diegans at the Park. Two other vaccination events took place in June. The Aug. 24 clinic will coincide with a three-game series where the Padres are celebrating Mexican Heritage and African American Heritage.
“COVID-19 is now primarily impacting people who are not fully vaccinated,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccine is the best way out of this pandemic and we value the Padres, and all of our community partners, for leaning in on this critical public health need. Do it for yourself. Do it for your friends and family.”
Along with hosting the third clinic, the Padres and Major League Baseball provided hundreds of game tickets that were distributed to San Diegans at community vaccination events and clinics throughout July.
“The health and safety of our employees and guests at Petco Park is our highest priority. When vaccines were first available we helped launch California’s first super vaccination station at the ballpark and began encouraging all of our employees to get vaccinated once the vaccine was available to them,” said Padres CEO Erik Greupner. “With the latest increase in cases due to the Delta variant, we felt that it was important to once again partner with the County to help encourage San Diegans to get vaccinated.”
Vaccine availability is plentiful and widespread throughout San Diego County. You can find it at doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County sites for people with no medical provider. For a list of locations and more information, visit  www.coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

695,COVID-19 Booster Shots Available for Immunocompromised,San Diegans with moderately to severely compromised immune systems can get a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine to fight waning immunity.  ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-booster-shots-available-for-immunocompromised/,2021-08-18T16:24:16-07:00,"
San Diegans with moderately to severely compromised immune systems can get a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine to fight waning immunity.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced the recommendation late last week because these people are more susceptible to severe disease from the virus. When making the recommendation, the CDC provided a very specific list of conditions for people who should receive the additional dose.
“San Diegans who are immunocompromised should speak with their doctor to determine the best course of action,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The best protection against COVID-19 is the vaccine and a third dose will help most people with compromised immune systems from developing severe illness from the virus.”
The estimated immunocompromised population in San Diego County is about 26,000. The County has begun working on vaccine plans to meet the guidance being drafted by the CDC for an expansion of additional doses in late September. No details are available currently.
In the meantime, Wooten continued to urge unvaccinated San Diegans to get their first dose and for those due a second dose to not delay. The Delta variant, which is more contagious, continues to drive up the number of cases being reported in the region.
“The COVID-19 vaccine is the best way to get us out of this pandemic,” Wooten said. “Get vaccinated now to avoid getting sick and passing the virus to others, especially people who are more vulnerable to the disease.”
The COVID-19 vaccine is available at medical providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers for people who do not have a medical provider. For a list of locations and more information, visit  www.coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: More than 4.45 million.
Received at least one shot: About 2.36 million or 84.2% of San Diegans 12 and older are partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.06 million or 73.6%.
The goal: vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 12 and older or 2,101,936 people, with at least one dose.
To date, 112.2% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 98.1% are fully vaccinated.
More vaccination information can be found coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Summertime means road trips — not just for those of us heading out for fun or vacation, but also for crews working to maintain and improve San Diego County’s unincorporated roads to protect drivers and keep the public safe.
Crews have already started working on this year’s $40 million worth of resealing and resurfacing on 98 miles of unincorporated roadways, with plans to spend an additional $56 million on additional roads in 2022.
Slurries and overlays are designed to make roads live longer, be quieter for drivers and improve traction and safety.
The work covers roads around the county, in 24 unincorporated communities and planning areas. The complete list of roads for the fiscal 2020/21 year runs through Alpine, Bonsall, Crest, Fallbrook, Jamul, Julian, Lakeside, Pine Valley, Ramona, Spring Valley and many others.  You’ll know the County is coming to your neighborhood when you receive a letter in the mail, a door hanger notification and see signs posted on streets being resurfaced.
The County’s Department of Public Works regularly maintains more than 1,900 miles of unincorporated roads — long enough to stretch from San Diego to Atlanta, Georgia. The department uses visual and mechanical inspection, as well as input from people and communities, to determine which roads need resurfacing every year.
The County’s annual road work received a big financial boost when California’s Senate Bill 1, the Road Repair and Accountability Act, was signed into law in 2017.
That led to County supervisors approving an expanded County road improvement plan; the County is currently in the fourth year of that plan. The County resurfaced 154 miles of roads the first year, 131 miles the second year, and is just finishing up 141 miles from the third year.
Recent advances now allow the County to use up to 25% recycled materials in new pavement, which means resurfacing is more sustainable than ever. In the first three years of the expanded road resurfacing program nearly 200,000 tons of recycled material was reused.
The County expects to receive $538 million from SB 1 through 2027.
So, when you see a crew out there working, give them a wave. Road trip!

700,SD Emergency App Users Now Can Have Earthquake Early Warning,"The County of San Diego’s SD Emergency app is now equipped with ShakeReadySD, an earthquake early warning system. This will let users know if an earthquake has occurred nearby that is likely to cause shaking within seconds and it will urge them to take protective action such as drop, cover and hold on or another appropriate safety measure.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/sd-emergency-app-users-now-can-have-earthquake-early-warning/,2021-08-25T14:11:47-07:00,"
The County of San Diego’s SD Emergency app is now equipped with ShakeReadySD, an earthquake early warning system. This will let users know if an earthquake has occurred nearby that is likely to cause shaking within seconds and it will urge them to take protective action such as drop, cover and hold on or another appropriate safety measure.
County officials were joined by a United States Geological Survey scientist Wednesday to roll out the improved mobile app at the County’s Emergency Operations Center in Kearny Mesa.
“ShakeReadySD is a new feature of our SD Emergency app,” said County Board of Supervisors Chairman Nathan Fletcher. “This is an early warning system that has the potential to give users a few seconds warning or a heads up that an earthquake is coming. And that advance warning could make all the difference. It could give you a number of seconds to be able to move your family, your friends into a safe place and help avoid serious injury.
“We really want to encourage people to download the application today, allow the notifications and put yourself in the best possible situation to be able to respond in the event of an earthquake.”
The County Office of Emergency Services has been working with the U.S. Geological Survey on the alert for more than a year. USGS has a network of more than 770 underground sensors and other technologies built to protect residents and visitors throughout California as part of its ShakeAlert® Earthquake Early Warning system, which is what powers the ShakeReadySD component of the SD Emergency App. This is the first time the ShakeAlert® system has been integrated into an existing emergency app.
“When it comes to disasters, we plan for all hazards – earthquakes, fires, floods, terrorism, extreme weather,” said Jeff Toney, director of the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services. “And our SD Emergency app is a one-of-a-kind tool designed to provide all San Diegans valuable information before, during, and after disasters – all in the palm of your hand.”
The ShakeReadySD technology is designed to trigger an alert to your cellphone if you are in a location close enough to an earthquake with a magnitude 4.5 or greater with a shaking intensity of 3 or greater. Following the alert, the app could provide emergency notifications such as road closures, shelters or other relevant critical information as needed.
Since it is tied to the statewide system of sensors, it will work anywhere in the state to alert people about imminent shaking.
“ShakeReadySD can save lives and reduce injuries by giving people time to take a protective action like drop, cover, and hold on, or move away from hazardous areas,” said Robert-Michael de Groot of the USGS. “We look forward to working with San Diego County to provide real-time earthquake early warning alerts powered by ShakeAlert.”
In order for the new feature to work, users who already have the app will need to update it and then configure the settings including selecting English or Spanish and allowing the app to always track the phone’s location so it can accurately alert the user if an earthquake with moderate to strong shaking is expected in the area. If you have not yet downloaded SD Emergency, you only need to install the latest version on their mobile devices and configure the settings.
The app is now available for iOs and Android phones and is free. Visit ReadySanDiego to learn more.

701,How the Recall Election Works,Get answers to some of the common questions voters have about casting ballots in the Sept. 14 election.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/how-the-recall-election-works/,2021-08-25T14:59:39-07:00,"
California is holding a gubernatorial recall election on Sept. 14, 2021. Anyone registered to vote in California can vote in the election. The recall is the only thing on the San Diego County ballot.
The recall ballot will ask voters two questions:

Do you want to recall the governor? A “yes” vote means remove the governor. A “no” vote means keep the current governor.
If recalled, who do you want to replace him?

You can vote on either one or both parts of the recall ballot. You can choose to vote for a replacement candidate, even if you voted “no” on the recall in the first question. The questions are counted separately and your response to one question does not affect the other.
The current governor is not listed among the replacement candidates. Under state law, a person whose recall is being sought cannot be a candidate to succeed themselves at a recall election. This also applies to write-in candidates. Only certified write-in candidates are counted. A certified list of write-in candidates will be available on Sept. 3.
If more than 50% of voters vote “yes” to recall the governor, then the replacement candidate with the most votes is elected.

702,"County Encourages Indoor Mask Wearing, Regardless of Vaccination Status","Amid a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the more contagious Delta variant of the virus, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is recommending all San Diegans wear facial coverings in indoor public settings.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-encourages-indoor-mask-wearing-regardless-of-vaccination-status/,2021-08-25T17:51:29-07:00,"
Amid a sharp increase in COVID-19 cases due to the spread of the more contagious Delta variant of the virus, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is recommending all San Diegans wear facial coverings in indoor public settings.
While vaccinated people are no longer required to wear a face covering in most settings, the California Department of Public Health updated its guidance for those who are fully vaccinated to strongly encourage the continued use of face coverings indoors.
The guidance recommends that all Californians, regardless of vaccination status, wear a mask in indoor public settings. People who are immunocompromised or at increased risk for severe disease from COVID-19 should be particularly cautious, as well as people who share a household with someone who is immunocompromised, at increased risk of severe disease, not fully vaccinated, or not yet eligible for vaccination.
Indoor masking for vaccinated people is also supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which notes that individual and community-level prevention measures, in addition to vaccination, have been shown to help reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The new guidance is in addition to CDPH mandates requiring masks on public transit, in transportation hubs like airports, indoors in K-12 schools and childcare centers, emergency shelters, cooling centers, healthcare settings, state and local correctional facilities and detention centers, homeless shelters, long term care settings and adult and senior care facilities.
Additionally, masks are required for unvaccinated individuals in indoor public settings and businesses, retail, restaurants, theaters, family entertainment centers and state and local government offices serving the public.
“Indoor masking, regardless of vaccination status, adds an additional layer of protection and reduces the risk of transmission of COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If you are not fully vaccinated yet, I urge you to get your shot now, so we can slow the spread of this more contagious strain of COVID-19.”
No-cost COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the region. They can be found at medical providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers for people who do not have a medical provider. For a list of locations and more information, visit  www.coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: More than 4.5 million.
Received at least one shot: About 2.38 million or 85% of San Diegans 12 and older are partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Close to 2.09 million or 74.4%.
The goal: vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 12 and older or 2,101,936 people, with at least one dose.
To date, 113.4% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 99.2% are fully vaccinated.
More vaccination information can be found coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

25 new deaths were reported since the last report on Aug. 18. The region’s total is 3,859.

703,Mice Collected in Mount Laguna Test Positive for Hantavirus,"Five deer mice and one brush mouse collected in routine monitoring in the Mount Laguna area have tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/mice-collected-in-mount-laguna-test-positive-for-hantavirus/,2021-08-26T09:43:44-07:00,"
Five deer mice and one brush mouse collected in routine monitoring in the Mount Laguna area have tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.
County officials are reminding people that if they find rodents in their homes, garages, sheds or cabins they should never sweep up or vacuum up after them, but use “wet-cleaning” methods instead, to keep from breathing in the virus and getting sick.
It is not uncommon to find hantavirus in wild rodents in San Diego County — there were 25 detections in 2020 and 42 in 2019 — but people are rarely exposed to it. The virus can cause deadly infections in people and there is no vaccine or cure.
People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed it in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries and is stirred into the air where people can breathe it in.
Because of that, County officials said people should never sweep or vacuum up if they find rodent nests or signs in their homes. If people must clean they should use “wet cleaning” methods — using bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

704,"County Expands Assistance for Struggling Tenants, Landlords",The County’s Housing and Community Development Services is rolling out two new initiatives aimed at assisting landlords and tenants who have struggled financially amid the COVID-19 pandemic.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-expands-assistance-for-struggling-tenants-landlords/,2021-08-26T11:34:11-07:00,"
The County’s Housing and Community Development Services is rolling out two new initiatives aimed at assisting landlords and tenants who have struggled financially amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Both efforts are part of the County’s existing Emergency Rent and Utilities Assistance Program, which supports low-income renters impacted by the pandemic.
Rental Assistance for Small Landlords
The first program will provide payments to landlords with rental properties whose tenants are late on their rent. The Rental Assistance for Small Landlord Program will compensate landlords or property owners for overdue rent payments accumulated since April 2020.
Recipients must meet several criteria, including the following:

The property must be located in San Diego County and the owner must be a county resident
The landlord must own no more than five rental units
Tenants in eligible units must be at least three months past due on their rent

The County will pay benefits directly to the landlord and applications will be accepted until funding runs out. The application period opens Sept. 1.
Security Deposit Assistance Program
The second initiative is aimed at making it easier for San Diego renters to come up with security deposits when moving to a new rental unit. Through the Security Deposit Assistance Program, eligible applicants can receive security deposit assistance, limited to two months’ rent, up to $7,000.
To qualify, the applicant must meet certain income limits and must sign a six-months or longer lease for the unit they plan to rent. Landlord participation is a requirement and payments will be made directly to the property owner.
The application period for security deposit assistance opens Sept. 3.
The programs lessen housing cost burdens and maintain housing stability for low-income renters and landlords who have faced financial hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
About Emergency Rent and Utilities Assistance 
The ERAP initiative provides assistance with rent, utilities and other costs such as internet service and application fees. The program is funded by federal and state grants and the County has successfully awarded $107 million to more than 12,000 households. The County recently received additional funding from both the federal and state government, allowing previous recipients to request additional assistance and expanding the pool of eligible applicants.

705,"County Animal Shelters Near Capacity, Need Adopters, Fosters","Can you help? After a recent influx of cats and dogs, the County Department of Animal Services’ two shelters are nearly full, and they are asking the public to consider adopting or fostering an animal or two.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-animal-shelters-near-capacity-need-adopters-fosters/,2021-08-26T13:52:41-07:00,"
Can you help? After a recent influx of cats and dogs, the County Department of Animal Services’ two shelters are nearly full, and they are asking the public to consider adopting or fostering an animal or two.
Animal Services is offering several discounts currently: Adoption fees are waived for adult cats (six months and older), $25 adoption fees for kittens; and $25 adoption fees for pit bulls/pit mixes and huskies/husky mixes. Additionally, all animals who have been in the shelter for 30 days or more will have their adoption fees waived. All the adopted animals will be spayed or neutered and microchipped before they go home. Vaccinations will also be up to date on dogs and cats.
“The department is committed to finding a home for every healthy and treatable animal that comes through our doors and that is why we are seeking the public’s help to adopt. We also have an urgent need for foster care,” said Kelly Campbell, Department of Animal Services director. “We will never euthanize for time or space, but our longer-stay animals would be so much happier in a home environment than in the shelters.”
Recently, the department took in more than 50 cats from a single owner, Campbell said. This contributed to the shelter capacity issue, she said.
“We were happy to step in and help,” Campbell said. “There are plenty of really lovely cats and some teenage kittens that would make great companions and some that just need a little time and a little love to come out of their shells.”
Of those cats, two large male cats have vision impairment, one tabby is completely blind (but very friendly), and the other, a beautiful snowshoe Siamese, may still retain some vision. Campbell said blind cats can thrive really well in their home once they get acclimated in their environment to the point that most people wouldn’t even know they were blind.
As for dogs, Campbell said there are also plenty, and it is never an ideal situation for a dog to be sitting in a kennel for any length of time, since it can contribute to kennel stress or longer-term behavioral challenges.
She said if people are willing to adopt, a forever home is always the ideal situation, but if people are unable to do that but can provide temporary care and shelter for a dog or cat, that help is very welcome since animals do significantly better in a home environment compared to a shelter one. Learn more about the foster program here and you can change the quality of life for that one animal for the short-term.
As a third option, Animal Services is also seeking volunteers that can come into the shelters and help socialize animals or help with laundry or other tasks that allow animal care attendants to focus on the pets, or to train to become specialized disaster response volunteers, saving animals affected by disasters. Here is information on volunteering.
So, if you’re able to add a furry friend to your life, all the animals pictured here are available. Or you can visit the department’s adoptions page for more pets.
Animal Services continues to offer “touchless adoptions” for the safety of customers and staff. Contact the animal shelter and they will let you know if the animal is available and will set up an appointment for you to come to one of the two shelters. People still need to go through the normal adoption process of filling out an application and doing a matchmaking consultation with staff. Staff just want to make sure new owners are prepared to welcome an animal into their lives and set up for success.
The shelters are located at  animal care facilities in Bonita and Carlsbad, but please remember to make an appointment first so you’ll receive dedicated one on one attention from our team. The adoptions are on a first-come, first-served basis.

County Supervisor Nora Vargas, County Parks officials, National City fire officials and others held a family-friendly grand reopening and dedication of Lincoln Acres County Park Saturday.
The neighborhood park, nestled just in front of the County’s Lincoln Acres branch library at 2717 Granger Ave. in the community of Lincoln Acres in National City, has been expanded in size to 1 ½ acres and equipped with new conveniences.
Improvements include two gazebos, covered picnic tables, a community garden, drinking fountain and water refilling station, and restrooms. The surfacing of the park’s existing playground was also upgraded. The park already provided families in the neighborhood with a children’s playground, basketball courts, restrooms and a community room.
“With new acreage and more equitable amenities and access, Lincoln Acres County Park has become a more desirable, prominent place for real community connection,” Supervisor Vargas said. “It’s important that we continue to prioritize projects like this; projects that support walkable and inclusive play spaces for small, densely populated communities like Lincoln Acres.”
Vargas, National City Fire Chief Frank Parra and County Parks Director Brian Albright opened Saturday’s event with a brief presentation, followed by an outdoor open house for a couple hundred members of the public who attended the event.
Former County Supervisor Greg Cox, who represented the area before Supervisor Vargas, also attended. The presentation included a dedication of a memorial plaque honoring the Lower Sweetwater Fire Protection District.
The open house included fun things for all ages, including animal “touch tables” with skulls, animal skins and live animals, an instructor-led exercise station, a planting workshop, plant-pot painting, photo opportunities with a National City fire engine. The County’s Live WoW (Well on Wheels) resource bus was also at the event, in addition to sheriff’s officials and local authors of a “Lincoln Acres Centennial Book.”

The County of San Diego is helping create almost 1,400 affordable housing units in 20 developments across 15 communities in the region.
The figure was announced during an update Tuesday to the Board of Supervisors on the results of the Innovative Trust Fund, established by the County in 2017.
The Innovative Housing Trust Fund invested $50 million to build affordable housing units in the region. Those funds helped the County and its partners to leverage $567 million in other public and private funds to create and preserve 1,397 permanent affordable housing units throughout the county.
“There is tremendous work being done countywide; not only to increase affordable apartment homes but also providing economic growth to the region,” said David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA).
Over the 99-year affordability period, the units created will serve an estimated 18,000 low-income families, older adults, veterans, developmentally disabled, people who are homeless and homeless with serious mental illness.
Five of the 20 developments funded by the trust fund have opened over the past few years in the cities San Diego, Poway and Vista, and generated 368 affordable housing units.
The Grove in Vista has 81 apartments occupied by low-income seniors.
There are currently 10 developments under construction, and they are slated to be finished between Dec. 2021 and Jan. 2024. Five others are going through the financing process.
“The Trust Fund is the first of its kind, being the first locally funded and administered program to offer funding for affordable housing throughout the entire San Diego region,” said HHSA Director Nick Macchione.
At the request of Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer and Supervisor Joel Anderson, the Board also approved an additional $25 million to support the production of affordable housing.
A total of $20 million of those funds will be used to create and/or preserve affordable housing in the region. Five million will be used for housing research, policy development, and piloting new programs and initiatives to develop comprehensive solutions that can accelerate housing production.
The goal is to come up with innovative housing solutions that advance equity, sustainability and affordability. It is estimated that the region will need about 83,000 affordable housing units by 2029 to keep up with population growth.

Residents in the unincorporated areas of the County will soon have a choice when it comes to buying electricity.
The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to authorize the County to join a community choice energy program (CCE) called San Diego Community Power. The CCE launched in March and includes the cities of Chula Vista, Encinitas, Imperial Beach, La Mesa and San Diego.
The County will become part of a joint powers authority which governs the CCE. Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer will represent the County and become a director on the JPA’s Board of Directors. Supervisor Nora Vargas will act as alternate director.
Community choice allows cities and counties to buy electricity, including renewable energy like solar and wind for residents and businesses. CCEs offer customers in the county’s unincorporated areas an alternative to buying power from San Diego Gas and Electric. SDG&E would still provide transmission and delivery services, as well as billing.
The CCE could provide residents competitive utility rates and cost savings compared to SDG&E, and also offer more renewable power.
Currently, there are 24 CCEs operating throughout the state including two in San Diego County, San Diego Community Power and the Clean Energy Alliance. The Alliance  members include Carlsbad, Del Mar and Solana Beach. In all, the state’s CCEs serve 11 million customers.
San Diego Community Power is the second largest CCE in California and is expected to begin serving County customers in spring 2023.

713,Disaster Plan Available to Help People Who May Need Assistance,"As wildfires burn out of control to our north, we are reminded that fires are a constant danger in San Diego County as well. Residents must do their part to prepare for an almost year-round fire season, in addition to other disasters. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/disaster-plan-available-to-help-people-who-may-need-assistance/,2021-09-01T10:29:54-07:00,"
As wildfires burn out of control to our north, we are reminded that fires are a constant danger in San Diego County as well. Residents must do their part to prepare for an almost year-round fire season, in addition to other disasters.
However, preparing to evacuate is not easy for some county residents. As a result, the County’s Office of Emergency Services and Department of Aging & Independence Services have teamed up to help older adults and those who may have access or functional needs develop a solid plan in preparing for an emergency or other disasters.
A “Personal Disaster Plan for People Who May Need Assistance” is currently available for pickup at many County libraries and can be downloaded on the ReadySanDiego.org website. The guide is available in English, Spanish, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Japanese, Arabic, traditional and simplified Chinese, Farsi, French, Korean and Somali as well as English and Spanish audio versions. A video has also been created to accompany the new plan.
The guide was developed for older adults and people with access and functional needs who may benefit from additional help when it comes to planning for disasters.  Access and functional needs refers to people who are or have physical, developmental or intellectual disabilities, chronic conditions or injuries, limited English proficiency, older adults, children, low income, homeless, dependent on transportation assistance and pregnant women. Caregivers, neighbors, friends and family can also use the guide to help develop personalized emergency plans for those they help.
“This guide is designed to help people evaluate their individual needs and personalize an emergency plan,” said Jeff Toney, San Diego OES director. “Each family member might have unique needs during a disaster and this plan can help both you and your loved ones be better prepared.”
Toney said the guide provides detailed steps for preparing for any emergency, including getting connected, planning, gathering supplies and staying informed.
“The guide also goes into the specific planning needed for different types of emergencies including wildfire, earthquakes, flooding and acts of terrorism,” Toney said. “This process is often difficult for those with access and functional needs, and the guide can be used by both individuals with special needs and their caregivers to develop a plan for all of these possible emergencies.”
Kim Gallo, director of Aging and Adult Services for AIS said making a disaster plan is important because people with access and functional needs are disproportionately affected during disasters.
“A heat wave may have a greater impact on an older adult in comparison to a younger adult; and an individual with mobility limitations may need extra time, assistance, and specialized transportation to evacuate during a fire or flood,” Gallo said. “To improve safety and well-being during a disaster, it is crucial to have a plan in place and establish a support network to provide appropriate assistance.”
Gallo said caregivers can play an essential role in assisting the person in their care with emergency preparedness.  They can act on the key steps outlined in the Personal Disaster Plan such as helping to identify emergency contacts, testing smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, securing a back-up power source for life-sustaining medical equipment, and/or completing a Vial of Life document to provide emergency responders with life-saving medical information.

714,COVID-19 Deaths Nearly Double in One Week,"A total of 49 COVID-19 deaths were reported in the region in the past seven days (Aug. 25-31), nearly double the 25 reported the week before (Aug. 18-24), the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-deaths-nearly-double-in-one-week/,2021-09-01T16:49:03-07:00,"
A total of 49 COVID-19 deaths were reported in the region in the past seven days (Aug. 25-31), nearly double the 25 reported the week before (Aug. 18-24), the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The newly reported deaths include 37 men and 12 women. Most of the deaths occurred in late August. Forty-one had underlying medical conditions, four did not and four had medical history pending.
Of the 49 deaths, 12 were 80 years of age or older, 13 were in their 70s, 12 were in their 60s, seven were in their 50s and five were in their 40s.
“These deaths are very tragic because they could have been prevented,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We now have very safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19. These deaths should not have occurred.”
Most of the deaths being reported now have been San Diegans who were not vaccinated.
Public health officials expected that more people would get vaccinated after the Food and Drug Administration gave full approval to the Pfizer vaccine on Aug. 23. The region has seen a slight uptick in vaccinations.
An average of 3,749 San Diegans got their first doses daily between Aug. 23 and Aug. 28. In comparison, an average of 3,651 people received their first shot between Aug. 17 and Aug. 22.
“Unvaccinated San Diegans are primarily the ones ending up in the hospital and, unfortunately, dying,” Wooten said.
No-cost COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the region. They can be found at medical providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers for people who do not have a medical provider. For a list of locations and more information, visit  www.coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Nearly 4.56 million.

716,Reconstruction of Affordable Housing Complex Underway in San Marcos,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and its partners broke ground Thursday on the replacement for an aging affordable housing complex in San Marcos.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/reconstruction-of-affordable-housing-complex-underway-in-san-marcos/,2021-09-02T15:54:03-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and its partners broke ground Thursday on the replacement for an aging affordable housing complex in San Marcos. Villa Serena, located just north of state Route 78, will help address the ongoing housing crisis in the region by providing affordable housing in an area known for its high cost of living.
“I believe it’s extremely important that we keep our young, working families in our region. This project, which provides workforce housing is an excellent example of what is needed in North County,” said County Supervisor Jim Desmond. “As the former mayor of the wonderful city of San Marcos, I am proud to see the city and the county coming together to make strides in addressing our housing crisis while staying true to the character of our well-loved communities.”
The former 136 units at Villa Serena are being replaced by 148 upgraded apartment homes for individuals and families whose household incomes are below the area’s median income. The County is partnering with the City of San Marcos and National Community Renaissance, also known as National CORE, to transform the aging complex.
“A quality development like Villa Serena provides long-term affordable housing to the families and individuals who need it most,” said David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “We look forward to generations of residents living and thriving as they enjoy safe and stable housing.”
Villa Serena was first built more than 50 years ago and over the years underwent several smaller renovations and upgrades. It will be replaced with a modern development that emphasizes units for families.
The original Villa Serena had only one three-bedroom apartment; the reconstruction will create 47 three-bedroom homes to better meet the needs of the surrounding family-centric neighborhood. The County and its partners will also set aside eight apartment homes for young adults who are aging out of the foster care system.
Once completed, residents will have access to an array of services and resources right inside their complex. Villa Serena’s 1,933-square-foot community center will serve as a hub for community events and activities, and residents will be able to participate in programs that promote their financial stability, self-sufficiency, and overall well-being.
The County invested $5.5 million from its Housing Trust Fund in the development.

718,"Supervisor Vargas, Library Open County’s First Little Library in Chula Vista","County Supervisor Nora Vargas, Chula Vista city officials, County Library officials and others opened a new library at Lauderbach Park in Chula Vista Saturday — a “Little Library” for local families, one of 40 the County plans to help install around the county in the coming months.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/supervisor-vargas-library-open-countys-first-little-library-in-chula-vista/,2021-09-04T11:15:52-07:00,"
County Supervisor Nora Vargas, Chula Vista city officials, County Library officials, families and children opened a new library at Lauderbach Park in Chula Vista Saturday — a “Little Library” for local families, one of 40 the County plans to help install around the county in the coming months.
Little libraries look like large mailboxes, but they’re actually neighborhood book exchanges where people can freely borrow or leave books for others to read. The Little Library opened Saturday in Chula Vista was filled with age-appropriate books in different languages, including “The Thank You Book,” “Can I Play Too?” and “Dora La Exploradora.”
“These (Little Libraries) are small neighborhood libraries that can be placed throughout our communities to allow anyone to have access to books closer to home,” Supervisor Vargas said at Saturday’s ribbon-cutting. “We as the County are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion. We want to inspire children and encourage everyone to read. Soon we will be opening other Little Libraries in the South Bay region, with locations in San Ysidro, Otay, and one in Paradise Hills.”
Led by Vargas, the County’s Board of Supervisors voted in March to create a Little Libraries Initiative to boost literacy in low-income and communities of color by giving people and children living in those communities more opportunities to have and read books in their homes.
Vargas said then that the County Library had “been fantastic” in promoting and increasing literacy through its 33 branch libraries, digital and e-books, services and programs.
However, she said families in some neighborhoods face obstacles, like lack of transportation, that keep them from taking advantage of the branch libraries, or financial constraints that hamper internet access and book-buying.

Little Libraries can help solve that by putting books in communities and promoting and encouraging reading at home — an important boost for literacy.
In 2020, the San Diego Council on Literacy reported that approximately 560,000 local adults read at an elementary school level, or not at all, and that 60% of low-income students have no books at home. Officials said Saturday that this disparity had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
Vargas told the audience Saturday that she was heartbroken to learn when she served as a Southwestern College board member that it was taking community college students six years to transfer to four-year colleges because they needed extra language and literacy education.
County Library Director Migell Acosta said research has shown that having as few as 20 books in a home can have a positive effect on a child’s level of education regardless of income. Library officials said the County has purchased 40 Little Libraries from the national Little Free Library Organization for roughly $28,000.
The County Library and the County’s Parks and Recreation department each plan to put up 20 of them in the coming months around the county. With the one opened in Lauderbach Park Saturday, the County has already put Little Libraries up in Chula Vista, Bonita and San Diego, and has plans for numerous other communities, including Borrego Springs, Campo, Julian, El Cajon, Lakeside, Vista and Oceanside.
The Library, through donations from the San Diego Council on Literacy, Words alive and the Children’s Initiative, will jump-start each of the Little Library collections with books.
Library officials said they’ve also worked with other library jurisdictions, County departments, community-based organizations and volunteer groups on the Little Library Initiative.

719,Chess Makes its Move at the County’s Waterfront Park,County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher and dozens of young competitors unveiled the County Waterfront Park’s newest feature Saturday — permanent chess tables — with a tournament and ribbon-cutting event.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/chess-makes-its-move-at-the-countys-waterfront-park/,2021-09-04T16:34:51-07:00,"
County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher and dozens of young competitors unveiled the County Waterfront Park’s newest feature Saturday — permanent chess tables — with a tournament and ribbon-cutting event.
The daylong tournament was the first held at the park’s new chess area next to the playground near the corner of Pacific Highway and Ash Street at the County Administration Center downtown. The tables are part of a larger renovation for the already-popular park that opened in 2014 that will ultimately add a dog park, exercise equipment, pickleball and basketball courts, and a T-ball area.
While those new amenities will focus on more traditional physical activities, Saturday’s tournament and new chess area showed that heading to the park can exercise people’s brains too — not just their muscles.
“You may not think of this as recreation in a traditional sense,” Fletcher said, “but the benefits of playing a game that demands this type of strategic thinking can grow exponentially when you have the opportunity to play it outside, in the fresh air, and in a peaceful, social park setting.
“By continuing to diversify offerings,” he continued, “we are bringing more recreation options to more people — meeting a variety of wants and needs in the community.”
The chess tables, including one that is ADA accessible, are located in a shaded area to keep players out of the direct sun. Chess pieces will be available to be checked out by the public on a first-come, first-served basis from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily at the Waterfront Park office. The office is located at the south entrance of the County Administration Center building.
Saturday’s tournament included three dozen youthful competitors broken into three age groups: “knights” aged up to 11 years old; “rooks,” comprised of 12-14 year olds; and “royals” aged 15-18 years old.
All participants received commemorative chess board sets. Second place finishers in each category received $25 gift cards; winners in each category received a trophy and a $50 gift card.
The County’s Department of Parks and Recreation hopes to open some of the other Waterfront Park improvements as early as spring 2022.

720,County Framework to Guide Decarbonization of Regional Economy,"The County of San Diego announced the development of a science-based approach to decarbonizing the region’s economy called the Regional Decarbonization Framework. Decarbonization, simply put, is about reducing the gases in the atmosphere that trap heat. The goal is to achieve a balance of the carbon cycle in nature.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-framework-to-guide-decarbonization-of-regional-economy/,2021-09-08T10:42:20-07:00,"
The County of San Diego announced the development of a science-based approach to decarbonizing the region’s economy called the Regional Decarbonization Framework.  Decarbonization, simply put, is about reducing the gases in the atmosphere that trap heat. The goal is to achieve a balance of the carbon cycle in nature.
This will be nation’s first, truly localized effort and is being crafted with expertise from the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy, and the Energy Policy Initiatives Center (EPIC) at the University of San Diego School of Law. This framework, directed by the Board of Supervisors on January 27, 2021, will help guide the region toward zero-carbon emissions.
The framework will recommend paths forward for the following sectors of San Diego County’s economy: energy, land use, transportation, industry and building. To build the framework, UC San Diego will utilize six technical experts in energy, transportation and buildings systems to chart the pathways that reduce carbon in the region.
To ensure equity is upheld in the framework and the local government policies that follow, EPIC will compare recommended RDF policies to existing local government policies and identify gaps that should be addressed so underserved communities are included.
“The County of San Diego is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and creating lasting change that benefits generations to come,” said Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Sarah Aghassi.
“We are proud to partner with UC San Diego and EPIC that will provide the technical and analytical expertise needed to build this science-based Framework that guides future policy decisions.”
The County recently completed a week of focus groups with business, labor and environmental representatives to better understand their perspectives. These will be followed by a September 13 public workshop. A core consideration influencing the development of the framework are the environmental injustices the region’s underserved communities have experienced to date related to air quality, infrastructure, jobs and housing.
All stakeholder input will help shape the consultant reports from our academic partners that will form a draft framework scheduled for public release in November 2021. This will be further vetted by a technical working group and additional community workshops. The Board will consider adoption of a final framework in early 2022.
“The collaboration with the County of San Diego is an example of the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy’s strengths in developing policy analysis that helps address the complex challenges of our time,” said UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla.
“In this case, the school is creating a scientific framework to help inform policies that will improve the lives of San Diegans and address the critical need of reducing CO2 emissions.”
The framework is a vision document being developed collaboratively through a locally based public-private partnership. The approach will serve as a model for other local governments throughout the nation.  Actual decarbonization results will come from its adoption and the implementation of policies enacted by various jurisdictions.
“By bringing business, labor, environment and community stakeholders together, we have our best chance at fighting climate change locally and improving our collective future,” said the County Land Use & Environment Group’s Program Manager for Regional Sustainability Murtaza Baxamusa.
Climate change has economic, social, and environmental impacts. It has immediate and long-term effects on our communities, ecosystems, food production, health, safety, jobs, businesses, and overall quality of life in San Diego region.
The regionally focused framework is different from the County’s Climate Action Plan Update (CAP) which is solely County-managed, limits greenhouse gases from activities only within the County’s municipal control and is tied to its General Plan.
More information about the framework, including the September 13 public workshop, can be found on its website.

721,What’s New For In-Person Voters In Gubernatorial Recall Election,San Diego County voters who choose to cast their votes in person in the Sept. 14 Gubernatorial Recall Election will notice a few differences. Voting locations will be open Sept. 11 through Election day.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/whats-new-for-in-person-voters-in-gubernatorial-recall-election/,2021-09-08T10:47:25-07:00,"
San Diego County voters who choose to cast their votes in person in the Sept. 14 Gubernatorial Recall Election will notice a few differences. Voting locations will be open Sept. 11 through Election Day.
Where to Vote
Voters won’t be tied or assigned to a specific voting location. That means any voter can find their ballot and cast their vote at any of the 221 in-person voting locations open across the county. Voters can find the most convenient voting location for them to cast their vote by checking the Registrar’s Voting Locations Finder map and typing in their address or location.
Casting your Vote
Everyone voting in person will cast their votes on touch-screen ballot marking devices that will print out a paper ballot with their choices that they can review before placing them in the official ballot box to be counted on election night.
The device prints out a ballot with the voters’ selections, but does not store, tabulate or count any votes.
The ballot marking devices, which the County has used in previous elections, are fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition to English, voters can select a translated ballot in one of the County’s four federally covered languages: Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese. The ballot marking devices also allow voters to change text size to make reading easier or  use the headphones with an audio ballot and handheld controller for voters with a visual impairment.
A poll worker will start a voter’s session by activating the device. Voters choose the language and make their selections by touching the screen next to voting choices. Voters can review their choices and make corrections if necessary on-screen, then tap “print ballot” to print it out. After reviewing their selections, voters can place their ballots in the secrecy sleeve or envelope given to them by the poll worker and may place it in the ballot box or give it to a poll worker to place in the ballot box for them. See step-by-step images of the process.
Keeping the Public Safe
Many of the 221 voting locations, such as schools, will require voters to wear face coverings when voting inside, regardless of their vaccination status. Voters can check to see which voting locations require face coverings before they head out. If you forget your face covering, poll workers will have one to give to you. Voters who are unable to wear a face covering will be able to vote outside.
If you plan to vote at the Registrar of Voters Office, or to drop off your mail ballot at a drop-off location, the County has put protocols in place to ensure the health and safety of voters, election workers and observers. They include:

All unvaccinated voters, observers and election workers must wear face coverings. Outdoor accommodations will be made available for voters who are unable to wear one.
All vaccinated voters, observers and election workers are strongly encouraged to wear face coverings.
Hand sanitizer will be readily available for everyone entering and exiting facilities.
Masks and gloves will be available for all voters and visitors.
Plexiglass barriers will be in use at the Registrar’s office and all voting locations.
Controlled path of travel when entering and exiting.
Frequently touched objects and surfaces will be regularly cleaned/disinfected.

Voters who have received mail ballots can still save themselves the trip and mark their ballot from home. Be sure to sign and date the return envelope, seal your completed ballot inside and mail it or return it to a mail ballot drop-off location or voting location.
You can confirm your ballot was received by the Registrar’s office at sdvote.com.

San Diegans with substance use disorders will get to celebrate their recovery or find inspiration and resources to begin their journey at the County’s annual Recovery Happens event.
Hundreds of people are expected to attend the celebration which will be virtual given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Recovery Happens, hosted by the County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA), is a free, family-friendly event, and will take place from 10:00 to 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 18.
“We host this annual event to celebrate San Diegans in recovery and the people who support them,” said Luke Bergmann, director of HHSA Behavioral Health Services. “Prevention works, treatment is effective, and people can and do recover.”
Now in its 31st year, Recovery Happens is celebrated every September during National Recovery Month. The event will feature inspirational speakers and performers celebrating those in recovery – whether the journey has only been a few days or many years.
There will also be a virtual resource fair where attendees can connect to an array of services such as education and employment support, veterans’ services, financial and legal services, prevention and treatment information, community resources and more.
Over the past year, the stress and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have presented unique challenges and stressors for people in recovery and those with a substance use disorder. Despite immense challenges, behavioral health treatment services are now more widely available than ever before. In an effort to keep the community connected to resources and support networks, the County has leveraged technology and is using telehealth to maintain a virtual presence and meet individuals where they are. All San Diegans are invited to attend this inspirational, virtual community event.
Behavioral health is an essential part of overall health and wellness and is a part of Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision to improve the health and safety of all area residents.
San Diegans with substance use disorders or experiencing a mental health issue are encouraged to seek help by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego.

727,Mentorship Program Pairs Local Youths and County Employees,A dozen youths are headed back to the classroom this fall with some hands-on work experience under their belts after they participated in the County’s first-ever Live Well San Diego Youth Mentorship and Internship Program over the summer.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/mentorship-program-pairs-local-youths-and-county-employees/,2021-09-13T12:00:08-07:00,"
A dozen youths are headed back to the classroom this fall with some hands-on work experience under their belts after they participated in the County’s first-ever Live Well San Diego Youth Mentorship and Internship Program over the summer. The initiative, a component of the new Live Well San Diego Youth Sector’s year-long leadership program, paired local young people with County employees for a three-month period, during which they learned about their mentor’s job and about the role County government plays in the region.
The leadership program was created to amplify youth voices and foster youth civic engagement. It also empowers participants to provide input on issues that are important to young people in the region.
The youths who participated in the inaugural cohort of the mentorship program were placed in various divisions across the County, including health promotion, emergency services and parks and recreation.
Sixteen-year-old Nadeen Youhanan decided to apply for the mentorship program because it allowed her to meaningfully engage with County government while getting hands-on work experience.
“As a current high school senior, it was the perfect way for me to get work experience and identify possible majors and careers that are of interest to me as I go into college,” said Youhanan. “Most importantly, I was able to connect with like-minded and talented youth and work with them in identifying ways to boost youth engagement within San Diego, as well as how we can support and improve our community.”
Her mentor, Justine Kozo, is the County’s chief of the Office of Border Health. Kozo also oversees the County’s Partner Relay, a joint initiative between Public Health Services and the Office of Emergency Services focused on improving emergency communications with non-English speaking communities.
“Many of our partners have told us that the communities they serve often rely on youth to understand what is happening during an emergency and also to translate important health and safety information for family members who may not speak or read English,” said Kozo. “Through her internship research, Nadeen has created recommendations on how to partner with youth to improve this communication pathway.”
Twenty-year-old Beatriz “B” Yumul was excited to bring their diverse background to their internship at the County.
“As a queer, nonbinary, first-generation, Filipinx, going into health care, I was excited to share my perspective and ideas,” Yumul said.
Yumul managed the Live Well San Diego social media accounts and compiled biweekly e-blasts containing resources and opportunities for young people throughout the region, as part of their internship. In addition to Yumul’s internship with the Live Well San Diego Youth Sector, they participated in a separate mentorship opportunity with Samantha Sonnich, a community health promotion specialist.
“My favorite part was getting to connect with B and support their passions and interests and learn from each other’s experience,” said Sonnich. “I learned a lot from my mentee including how technology can help promote diversity and inclusion, how to involve youth in County programs and efforts, and how passionate and creative the younger generation is.”
The two met once a week for an hour to share successes and challenges and discuss topics related to the mentorship goals they had set together at the beginning of the program.
“After my time with the County this summer, I will be a lot more aware of the possibilities of what I could pursue professionally in the realm of public health and with the County,” said Yumul. “I will be sharing these resources and doing my part to increase awareness and familiarity between my peers and members of my communities.”
The Live Well San Diego Youth Sector will begin recruitment for its next cohort of young leaders early next year. Kozo and Sonnich look forward to participating in future iterations of the program.
“There are so many different careers through the County, and I’m hoping that we continue to expand these opportunities to share our love for public service and inspire, learn from, and give space to younger generations,” said Sonnich.
“It’s exciting to incorporate work with youth leaders as their perspective is essential for constructive change and positive impact,” said Kozo.

Recognizing things will change for workers in a decarbonized economy, the County of San Diego has undertaken a study to better understand how different policies may affect the region’s labor force and to identify tailored workforce development resources to adapt the skills of our region’s workers, including those from disadvantaged communities.  The study will help the County develop a coordinated regional strategy to address workforce needs, including the transition of any displaced fossil fuel workers.
“As we move toward a zero-carbon future, we must make policy decisions with equity in mind so that it benefits our communities, especially the most vulnerable,” said Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Nora Vargas.” These communities are disproportionately impacted by pollution and climate change, and we must focus our efforts so that we can develop lasting and sustainable solutions that mitigate these impacts.”
The report will be presented to the Board of Supervisors early next year and is being led by two distinguished women: Dr. Carol Zabin, a renowned UC Berkley professor who co-wrote California’s most comprehensive study on green jobs, and Betony Jones, a nationally recognized expert on the impacts of climate and energy policies on job quality and job access. Dr. Zabin serves on the executive council of the California Workforce Development Board, and Jones recently prepared the “High-Road Workforce Guide for City Climate Action,” a national toolkit on workforce development for the American Cities Climate Challenge project.
“As we transition to a decarbonized economy, we must consider how this will impact our region’s workforce,” said Sarah Aghassi, deputy chief administrative officer for the County’s Land Use and Environment Group. “This study, combined with local labor and industry collaboration, will help ensure thoughtful policies are advanced for the Board’s consideration, and that the best training opportunities are available to those most affected by this shift.”
The report will consider the policy recommendations generated from the Decarbonization Framework pathways advanced by UC San Diego’s David Victor, Ph.D., and Gordon McCord, Ph.D.  Both professors are part of the university’s Sustainable Development Goals Policy Initiative, which belongs to a national coalition of experts who have laid out the path forward to reach zero carbon emissions in the United States by 2050.  Dr. McCord is the Associate Teaching Professor and SDG Policy Initiative Director, UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.  Dr. Victor is professor of Innovation and Public Policy at the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy.

You can do so now at one of 221 voting locations around the county or the Registrar’s office until 8 p.m.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuesday-is-the-last-day-to-vote-2/,2021-09-14T08:00:26-07:00,"
Tuesday, Sept. 14 is the deadline to cast your ballot in the California Gubernatorial Recall Election. You can do so now at one of 221 voting locations around the county or the Registrar’s office until 8 p.m.
If you’re still holding onto your mail ballot, the Registrar’s office reminds you to return it promptly to one of 131 mail ballot drop-off locations or any voting location. Mail ballot locations will also be open until 8 p.m. on Election Day.
Any voter who is in line at a voting location or drop-off location at 8 p.m. will be allowed to vote. However, no one can join the line to vote after the 8 p.m. deadline.
All in-person voters this election will use ballot marking devices. The voter uses a touch screen to make their selections. When finished, the voter will print out a paper official ballot with their selections. The voter can review the ballot and place it in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar’s office election night. This device does not store, tabulate, or count any votes.
Ballot marking devices are fully compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act, and in addition to English, voters have the ability to select a translated ballot in one of the County’s four federally covered languages: Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese and Chinese.
The Registrar of Voters has put in place protocols to ensure the health and safety of election workers, voters and observers at the Registrar’s office, voting locations and mail ballot drop-off locations.
As in all elections, the Registrar’s office works collaboratively with local law enforcement agencies to ensure voting locations and mail ballot drop-off locations are safe and voters can cast their ballot free from any interference, disruption or intimidation from others.

730,Gubernatorial Recall Election Results – When To Expect Them,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away. But counting ballots takes time, and that includes for a special election such as the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election. So, when should you expect them?",https://www.countynewscenter.com/gubernatorial-recall-election-results-when-to-expect-them/,2021-09-14T13:25:54-07:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away. But counting ballots takes time, and that includes for a special election such as the Sept. 14 California Gubernatorial Recall Election. Here are some reasons why:

Record high number of over 1.96 million registered voters.
More mail ballots issued than ever before because every active registered voter received a ballot in the mail.
Mail ballots can be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and received on or before Sept. 21.
Voting locations opened for a four-day period, Sept. 11 – Sept. 14.

So, what can you expect on election night?
The first set of unofficial results will appear shortly after 8 p.m. This will include mail ballots received before Election Day, including polls ballots from early voting between Sept. 11 – 13. After the first unofficial report, election night updates will add only ballots cast at polls on Election Day.
The Election Day ballots come in after the polls close at 8 p.m. There may be a gap in time for the next set of results due to poll workers packing up supplies at each location and driving from 221 voting locations across the county.
Upon arrival, the polls ballots are scanned, and results will be periodically updated throughout the night until most of the precinct ballots have been counted.
It may be midnight, however, before all voting location ballots arrive at the Registrar’s. The final unofficial election night results may not come in until after 1 a.m. and will only cover the ballots that can be counted immediately. You can follow the Registrar’s office on Twitter for updates.
The counting of ballots does not end on election night. Here’s what remains:
Mail ballots. The Registrar’s office mailed over 1.96 million ballots for this election and anticipates between 200,000 to 250,000 mail ballots could be dropped off at voting locations or picked up at the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Plus, mail ballots sent right before or on Election Day have 7 days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots. People who missed the Aug. 30 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day. It’s unknown how many people will choose to do that.
For each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter didn’t already cast a ballot.
After election night, the next release of unofficial results will be Thursday, Sept. 16 after 5 p.m. Additional postings may occur at the discretion of the Registrar.
However, election results must be certified 30 days after Election Day, on Oct. 14, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.

731,$12 Million in Federal Funding Goes to Housing Programs,"The County spent nearly $12 million in federal entitlement funds last fiscal year on affordable housing, homelessness issues, community infrastructure, and housing or services for people living with HIV/AIDS.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/12-million-in-federal-funding-goes-to-housing-programs/,2021-09-15T12:37:03-07:00,"
The County spent nearly $12 million in federal entitlement funds last fiscal year on affordable housing, homelessness issues, community infrastructure, and housing or services for people living with HIV/AIDS.
The figure was part of the 2020-21 Consolidated Annual Performance and Evaluation Report (CAPER), which summarizes accomplishments on housing programs during that fiscal year and went today before the County Board of Supervisors.
More than $11.74 million was spent of four federal entitlement programs funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and administered by Housing and Community Development Services (HCDS) at the County Health and Human Services Agency.
Last fiscal year, the County exceeded annual outcome projections in each of the four core funding areas: Community Development Block Grant, Home Investment Partnerships, Emergency Solutions Grant and Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS.
The County also administers funding provided by the state through the State Emergency Solutions Grant program. The activities, as described in the CAPER, predominately benefited lower-income residents. The investments included:

Approximately $5.3 million was spent on affordable housing, which included the construction of The Grove, an 80-unit affordable housing development in Vista—140% of the goal.
Nearly $5 million on housing for people with HIV/AIDS or 325% of the projection.
More than $800,000 was expended on homelessness, primarily on homeless prevention, rapid rehousing, emergency shelters and street outreach. In the area, the County accomplished 127% of the goal.
More than $750,000 on new infrastructure, including park improvements, street and sidewalk construction or repairs and public services—133% of the goal.

Through these efforts, the County served a total of more than 125,000 people and 5,000 households during the 2020-21 fiscal year.
The CAPER requires public comment and a public hearing before it is submitted to the federal government.
Don Dussault County Park was renovated using Community Development Block Grant funds.
In addition to accepting the report, the Board also voted to allow the County to apply for $500,000 from the state through the State Emergency Solutions Grant program to be used during the current fiscal year.
Like the federal Emergency Solutions Grant, the state funds are used to serve people who are homeless and those at risk of homelessness throughout the region.

732,Board Paves Way for Legalization of Small Home Kitchens,"The County moved a step closer to legalizing microenterprise home kitchen operations, known as MEHKOs.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-paves-way-for-legalization-of-small-home-kitchens/,2021-09-15T17:22:42-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted today to move forward with plans to legalize microenterprise home kitchen operations, or MEHKOs. MEHKOs are defined by California law as a small retail food facility, operated from a private home.
The state allowed local jurisdictions to begin authorizing MEHKOs in 2018. So far, seven California cities and counties, including Santa Barbara and Riverside, have legalized these home-based food operations.
The ordinance would legalize local home kitchens that prepare, sell and serve up to 30 meals per day, or 60 meals per week. MEHKO operators would be allowed to earn a maximum annual revenue of $50,000.
MEHKO menus would be restricted to items that can be prepared and sold the same day and would exclude items that contain raw milk or raw shellfish. Meals could be served in the home, picked up by the customer, or delivered by the MEHKO operator.
MEHKO operators would be required to obtain a valid health permit from the County and submit to an initial inspection and annual inspections afterwards. MEHKO operators would also be required to obtain a Food Manager Certificate and any of their employees would be required to get a Food Handler’s card.
The ordinance would create economic opportunities for small-scale, home-cooking operations, which are primarily operated by women, immigrants, and people of color. It would also legalize food businesses that have been making and selling food from home illegally.
The item was brought to the board by Vice Chair Nora Vargas and Supervisor Joel Anderson. County staff now have 120 days to return to the board with a draft of the ordinance.

733,High Number of COVID-19 Deaths Continues to Be Reported,"Fifty-seven COVID-19 deaths were reported in the past week (Sept. 8-14), the highest weekly total during this current surge of the pandemic.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/high-number-of-covid-19-deaths-continues-to-be-reported/,2021-09-15T17:50:02-07:00,"
Fifty-seven COVID-19 deaths were reported in the past week (Sept. 8-14), the highest weekly total during this current surge of the pandemic.
That’s more than triple the 18 COVID-19 deaths that were reported the previous seven days (Sept. 1-7) and higher than the 49 announced the week before that (Aug. 25-31).
The new deaths occurred between Aug. 19 and Sept. 13, and 11 (19%) of the 57 people who died were fully vaccinated. The deceased were 34 men and 23 women; 54 had underlying medical conditions, one did not and two had medical history pending.
Of the 57 deaths, 15 were 80 years of age or older, 11 were in their 70s, 22 were in their 60s, four were in their 50s, two were in their 40s and three were in their 30s. A total of 3,983 San Diegans have died from COVID-19 in the region.
“These deaths are very unfortunate. Our condolences go out to their family and friends,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “COVID-19 vaccines are widely available and can prevent San Diegans from getting seriously ill, getting hospitalized or, worse, dying.”
COVID-19: A Pandemic of the Unvaccinated
COVID-19 continues to be a pandemic of the unvaccinated in San Diego County.
According to the latest County Health and Human Services Agency COVID-19 Watch report, since March 1, 2021, over 96% of hospitalizations (2,150) and nearly 89% of deaths (208) have occurred in people who are not fully vaccinated. In comparison, the report, which covers data through Sept. 11, shows that 75, or 3.4% of, fully vaccinated San Diegans have required hospitalization and 11.1%, or 26, died.
Furthermore, 81.3% (65,635) of the COVID-19 cases have occurred in San Diegans who are not fully vaccinated compared to 19.7% (15,138) cases in people who were fully vaccinated.
In the last 30 days, 21,741 cases and 548 hospitalizations (2.5% of the total) have occurred in those not fully vaccinated, compared with 5,587 cases and just nine hospitalizations (0.2 percent of the total) for those fully vaccinated.
“While we’ve seen a higher number of breakthrough infections, almost all of the deaths and hospitalizations are occurring in San Diegans who are not fully vaccinated,” Wooten said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is the best tool we have to get out of this pandemic. Protect yourself and others. Get vaccinated now.”
No-cost COVID-19 vaccines are widely available in the region. They can be found at medical providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers for people who do not have a medical provider. For a list of locations and more information, visit  www.coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Close to 4.7 million.
Received at least one shot: About 2.5 million or 87.1% of San Diegans 12 and older are partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.16 million or 77.2%.
The goal: fully vaccinate 75% of San Diego County residents 12 and older or 2,101,936 people, with at least one dose.
To date, 116.1% of the goal population has received at least one vaccine and 102.9% are fully vaccinated.
More vaccination information can be found coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

734,County Hires First Two Local Subcontractors for Construction of Southeastern Live Well Center,"Keeping its commitment to hire locally, the County’s contractor has brought on board two subcontractors who bid to work on the construction of the Southeastern Live Well Center.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-hires-first-two-local-subcontractors-for-construction-of-southeastern-live-well-center/,2021-09-16T11:42:58-07:00,"
Keeping its commitment to hire locally, the County’s contractor has brought on board two subcontractors who bid to work on the construction of the Southeastern Live Well Center.
Industrial Fire Sprinkler Co. Inc. and Cats Excavating, Inc. were chosen out of nine trade applicants in the first bid group.
Located at 1944 54th St., Cats Excavating, Inc. specializes in demolitions, earthwork, underground utilities, paving and sidewalk and gutters.
Industrial Fire Sprinkler Co. Inc., located 3854 Imperial Ave., is a full-service fire sprinkler contractor that designs, installs, services and inspects fire sprinkler systems.
“We pledged to hire local companies as part of this $65 million project and we’re keeping our promise,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. “Construction of the new facility will involve local companies and workers from the area.”
The 65,000-square-foot Southeastern Live Well Center will serve as a hub for health and social services in the region.
Virtually every aspect of the project has been reviewed by the community. Area residents were involved from the selection of the services the Southeastern Live Well Center will offer to the design, color, look, layout and feel of the facility.
The Southeastern Live Well Center, to be built at the intersection of Market Street and Euclid Avenue, will provide a full array of community services including medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans services.
The center also will provide space for community meetings in its 4,000-square-foot conference center which includes a large main conference room and separate smaller spaces.
The County made a commitment that a minimum of 5% of the workforce will be comprised of local workers residing in Southeastern San Diego.
“The Southeastern Live Well center will benefit area residents on two fronts: services and jobs,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas. “The new facility will make the community proud and provide the services our residents need to improve their health and their overall well-being as well as jobs, and career opportunities for residents.”
The next informational meeting about the project is set for Sept. 20 with the Chollas Valley Community Planning Group.
On Oct. 14, there be will another virtual contract fair designed to bring in local businesses as subcontractors. You can register for the fair here.

735,Year’s First Human West Nile Virus Case Reported in San Diego,"A 53-year-old San Diego County resident is the first locally acquired case of West Nile Virus this year, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/years-first-human-west-nile-virus-case-reported-in-san-diego/,2021-09-17T15:35:18-07:00,"
A 53-year-old San Diego County resident is the first locally acquired case of West Nile Virus this year, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The La Jolla man was hospitalized but is expected to recover.
There was one West Nile virus case in San Diego County in 2020, three in 2019 and two in 2018.
West Nile virus is mainly a bird disease but can be transmitted to people by certain species of native San Diego County mosquitoes that first feed on an infected bird or animal and then a bite a person.
At least 80% of people who become infected with West Nile virus never know it and never suffer any symptoms. About one in five people who are infected develop a fever and other symptoms such as headache, nausea, fatigue, skin rash or swollen glands. About 1 out of 150 infected people will develop serious illness.
County public health and environmental health officials say the best way for people to protect themselves against the virus is to follow the County’s Prevent, Protect, Report guidelines. These guidelines can also help county residents protect themselves from mosquitoes that transit West Nile virus as well as invasive Aedes mosquitoes that can transmit tropical diseases, such as Zika, dengue and chikungunya, if they first bite an infected person and then bite non-infected people.
Prevent mosquito breeding
Dump out or remove any item inside or outside of homes that can hold water, such as plant saucers, rain gutters, buckets, garbage cans, toys, old tires, and wheelbarrows. Mosquito fish, available for free by contacting the Vector Control Program, may be used to control mosquito breeding in backyard water sources such as unused swimming pools, ponds, fountains, and horse troughs. Mosquito Fish Distribution Locations (sandiegocounty.gov)
Protect Yourself from Mosquito Bites
Protect yourself from mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing long sleeves and pants or use repellent when outdoors. Use insect repellent that contains DEET, picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Make sure screens on windows and doors are in good condition and secured to keep insects out.
Report Possible Mosquito Activity
Report increased mosquito activity, or neglected, green swimming pools and other mosquito-breeding sources, as well as dead birds — dead crows, ravens, jays, hawks and owls — to Environmental Health’s Vector Control Program by calling (858) 694-2888 or emailing vector@sdcounty.ca.gov. Also, report if you are being bitten by mosquitoes during daylight hours, or if you find mosquitoes that match the description of Aedes mosquitoes by contacting the Vector Control Program at (858) 694-2888.

Substance abuse continues to take a toll on San Diego County residents and communities.
A total of 722 San Diegans died with meth in their system and another 576 people died due to prescription drugs in the region last year, the Methamphetamine Strike Force and Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force announced today.
The Meth Report Card shows the new figure far exceeds the previous record set in 2019 when 546 deaths reported.
The prescription drug and opioid deaths reported in 2020 more than double the 275 fatalities reported in 2019.
The prescription drug report also includes statistics on fentanyl. It shows that a record 462 people died from fentanyl in 2020, compared to 151 the year before that. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid primarily coming from Mexico that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine and 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin.
Key Meth Indicators
The 2021 meth report card was released by District Attorney Summer Stephan and Holly Porter, deputy chief administrative officer for the County Public Safety Group. The report card shows the leading indicators of meth problems in the region.
The 2021 Meth Report Card also shows:

566 men and 156 women died with meth in their system.
There were 16,309 emergency room visits due to methamphetamines in 2019 compared to 13,020 in 2018. Data from 2020 will be available in 2022.
A total of 4,740 people were admitted to County-funded treatment programs due to meth abuse last year, vs. 6,591 in 2019.
56% of adult arrestees tested positive for meth in 2020, compared to 59% the previous year.
8% of juvenile arrestees tested positive for meth in 2020, compared to 11% in 2019.
Arrests for selling and possession of meth decreased to 7,211 compared to 11,313 in 2019.


Prescription Drug Problem in San Diego
The Prescription Drug Report Card was released by task force tri-chairs Cindy Cipriani, senior management counsel at the Office of the U.S. Attorney, Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency and Dr. Steven Campman, County chief medical examiner.
In addition to deaths, the Prescription Drug Report Card tracks additional key indicators of opioid misuse in the region. It also shows the following (most recent years for which numbers are available vary by statistic):

430 men and 146 women died from prescription drugs.
7,723 visits to local emergency rooms in 2019, compared to 6,162 in 2018. Data for last year is not yet available.
10% of 11th graders reported prescription drug use in 2019, the same percent as in 2017. The survey is done every two years.
46% of adults arrested reported misusing prescription drugs in 2020, the same as the year before.

An important tool to prevent opioid overdose is naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, which is a medication used to reverse some overdoses by restoring normal breathing. Naloxone can be used to prevent opioid overdose, if used quickly and followed by medical treatment.
Treatment is Available
The County funds residential and outpatient treatment programs across the region to help people recover from substance use disorders.
Participation in treatment and recovery services improves wellbeing, can reunite families and loved ones, and also improves overall health.

739,County Parks Earn National Thumbs Up,"The County’s parks and recreation system was awarded reaccreditation this week from the national Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies, once again winning kudos for its parks, programs, community involvement and operations.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-parks-earn-national-thumbs-up/,2021-09-23T15:31:50-07:00,"
The County’s parks and recreation system was awarded reaccreditation this week from the national Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies, once again winning kudos for its parks, programs, community involvement and operations.
The accreditation marked the third consecutive time the County Parks and Recreation Department has earned the five-year national commendation — after earning it in 2011 and 2016 — and the first time the County system met 100% of the commission’s 154 judging standards.
Some of the commission’s standards include whether park operators have comprehensive plans to provide facilities, programs and services; how they include communities in the planning process; how they recruit, train and retain park volunteers; how they acquire and maintain park lands, and how they collaborate with other groups like schools, other agencies and groups to coordinate programs.
The commission is the only national accrediting agency for park operators. To earn accreditation, park operators must meet 36 of the 154 standards that are deemed “fundamental,” and at least 85% of the remaining 118.
The County Department of Parks and Recreation is one of just 192 parks agencies nationwide — and one of four in California — to earn the recognition.
The department’s accreditation is even more impressive because of the sheer size and scope of the county’s system.
Parks and Recreation operates 152 facilities on 56,000 acres of land, including parks, camping parks, sports parks, community centers, nature centers open space preserves, historic sites and 380 miles of trails from the coast to the valleys to the desert.
Parks’ programs and services run the gamut, from all types of events — such as Halloween, Earth Day, yearly egg hunts and weddings — to educational demonstrations about nature and the environment; fishing and boating; Track Trails that encourage kids to enjoy getting outside and hiking by using their smart phones to track their progress in online nature journals; learning and practicing bike skills; camping and even enjoying Summer Movies in the Park and other cool fun.
The accreditation process required two years of preparation by County Park’s leaders and staff, including extensive self-assessment, and gathering and organizing data and documents to demonstrate best practices in all parts of the department. The information was evaluated by industry professionals working on behalf of the commission.

740,County Adds More Supportive Housing Units for Seniors,"The County and its community partners today celebrated the grand opening of a new affordable housing complex for seniors, including those with chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-adds-more-supportive-housing-units-for-seniors/,2021-09-24T12:56:02-07:00,"
The County and its community partners today celebrated the grand opening of a new affordable housing complex for seniors, including those with chronic physical illnesses and mental health conditions.
Trinity Place, located in the community of Grantville and built at the direction of Wakeland Housing and Development Corporation, was designed specifically for formerly unhoused seniors with chronic health issues, so residents will have access to social and medical services that promote health, housing stability and their overall well-being.
Of the 73 apartments, 18 are dedicated permanent supportive housing units serving seniors 55 and older experiencing homelessness and mental health conditions.
These residents will receive County-funded supportive services in addition to permanent housing. Wakeland received more than $2.7 million in loans through the County’s Mental Health Services Act Special Needs Housing Program.
Some unique features for seniors include:

Adaptable apartments with bathroom grab bars, large door handles and easy-to-open cabinets
A dedicated curbside pick-up area next to the main lobby for service provider vans to transport tenants, as well as four van spaces and a separate pick-up area in the garage
Apartments with ADA features for residents with hearing and vision impairments
An exercise room to promote movement for able-bodied residents

Residents at Trinity Place have access to services from four high-quality providers: 

PATH (People Assisting the Homeless)
St. Paul’s PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly)
Community Research Foundation – Senior IMPACT
Alpha Project Home Finder

“Permanent supportive housing has repeatedly shown it can reduce the frequent need for behavioral health crisis services and emergency room visits, as well as criminal justice involvement,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Tenants report an increased ability to focus on their recovery, reconnect with loved ones, and are able to pursue educational and employment goals. I’m pleased that Trinity Place adds 18 more units to provide this level of care.”
William is one of the residents at Trinity Place.
Trinity Place funding partners include the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee, Wells Fargo, San Diego Housing Commission, Civic San Diego, CalHFA/County of San Diego, California Community Reinvestment Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Low Income Investment Fund.
Wakeland works with these providers at other affordable housing communities like Trinity Place.
“Completing this property demonstrates Wakeland’s commitment to provide affordable homes that help people who are struggling during the current housing crisis,” said Ken Sauder, Wakeland’s president and CEO. “Trinity Place is unique in that it not only gives these seniors a safe place to live, but also offers wraparound services designed to help them live stable, independent lives.”

741,"County to Shift, Increase COVID Testing in Southeastern San Diego",The County is increasing its COVID-19 testing capabilities in Southeastern San Diego.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-shift-increase-covid-testing-in-southeastern-san-diego/,2021-09-24T16:57:09-07:00,"
The County is increasing its COVID-19 testing capabilities in Southeastern San Diego. With the closing of the Tubman Chavez Community Center, several local churches are stepping up to provide sites for COVID-19 testing in the area.
The shift will ensure that the community will continue to have access to free testing. The move will also expand testing availability from five to seven days among the locations.
Beginning Sunday, Sept. 26, the following sites will provide no-appointment COVID-19 testing:
Sundays and Mondays 
9 a.m. – 3:30 p.m.
Bayview Baptist Church
6134 Pastor Timothy J Winters St, San Diego, CA 92114
Monday – Friday 
10:30 a.m. – 5:30 p.m.
Encanto Southern Baptist Church
6020 Akins Ave, San Diego, CA 92114
Tuesday – Saturday 
10 a.m. – 5:30 p.m.
City of Hope International Church
4999 Holly Dr, San Diego, CA 92113
“The summer surge of COVID-19 cases brought increased demand for testing, and we appreciate these partners helping us bring new testing opportunities to the community,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.
The Tubman Chavez Community Center closed its doors for good Thursday, ahead of the groundbreaking for the Southeastern Live Well Center next week. The new project will replace and expand the space for public events that was previously available at the Tubman Chavez Community Center.
The center has played a vital role in the response to COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic. Since June 29, 2020, it has provided 182,082 COVID tests and 5,705 vaccinations.
In recent months, the Tubman Chavez Community Center has been open Sundays through Thursdays for COVID-19 testing, as vaccination services shifted across the street to the larger Joe and Vi Jacobs Center.
Vaccinations will continue to be available in the area from 9:30 a.m. – 3:30 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday, both at the Jacobs Center (404 Euclid Ave., San Diego, CA 92114) and the Educational Cultural Complex in Mountain View (4343 Ocean View Boulevard, San Diego, CA 92113).

742,COVID-19 Vaccine Booster Shots Available in San Diego County,The County is encouraging eligible San Diegans to get a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster shot six months after being fully vaccinated.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-vaccine-booster-shots-available-in-san-diego-county/,2021-09-27T16:40:42-07:00,"
Following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health’s recommendation, the County is now encouraging eligible San Diegans to get a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine booster shot six months after being fully vaccinated.
The following groups should receive a third dose of Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine:

People age 65 and older
Residents age 18 and older in long-term care settings
People 50–64 years old with underlying medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, heart disease and compromised immune systems

“While the COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, research has shown the protection they offer may decrease over time, and that’s why a booster is recommended for people in these groups,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “These San Diegans are at higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19 even after getting vaccinated and should get their booster shot as soon as they qualify.”
The CDC says that the following groups may receive a Pfizer booster shot based on their personal benefits and risks:

People age 18–49 with underlying medical conditions
People age 18–64 who are at increased risk for COVID-19 exposure and transmission because of occupational or institutional setting, such as first responders, grocery store workers, etc.

San Diegans in the above categories should talk to their health care provider about whether getting a Pfizer booster shot is appropriate for them. However, a physician’s referral is not required to get the booster shot.
Where to Get the Pfizer Booster Shot
Currently, only the Pfizer vaccine booster shots have received full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. However, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are likely to be approved in the coming months.
Pfizer vaccine shots for children between 5 and 11 years of age are also expected to be approved soon.
There are over 400 locations where San Diegans can get vaccinated against COVID-19. They include doctor’s offices, retail pharmacies (Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS, etc.), community clinics and County public health centers.
Nearly 80% of eligible San Diegans are now fully vaccinated. There is plenty of COVID-19 vaccine available in the region for booster shots and for San Diegans who have not yet been vaccinated.
San Diegans are encouraged to visit MyTurn to make an appointment or find a walk-in clinic that is offering the Pfizer vaccine booster shot or other COVID-19 vaccines. You can also find a complete list of locations at coronavirus-sd.com.

744,County Opens Free-Standing Crisis Stabilization Unit in North County,People experiencing a behavioral health crisis in North County now have a new resource available to them.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-opens-free-standing-crisis-stabilization-unit-in-north-county/,2021-09-30T16:22:22-07:00,"
People experiencing a behavioral health crisis in North County now have a new resource available to them.
A new community-based crisis stabilization unit (CSU) opened today in Vista. This new service, the first of its kind outside a hospital setting, provides much needed support to individuals who might typically end up at a local emergency room or jail.
County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher said in the last three years, the Board has made significant increases in investment and funding to provide better access to behavioral health services.
“It is about how do we build a system that works…Projects like this, crisis stabilization units are a vital component,” Chair Fletcher said. “It is so important that we meet people where they are. That we get the right care, to the right person at the right time and get the right outcomes.”
For the CSU opening, Chair Fletcher was joined by Supervisor Jim Desmond, District Attorney Summer Stephan, Undersheriff Kelly Martinez, Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency, Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of County Behavioral Health Services and Luana Murphy, president and CEO of Exodus Recovery, Inc.
What Are Crisis Stabilization Units?
Crisis stabilization units provide services in a community-based or hospital settings for people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis.
Services are provided on a walk-in basis with stays of less than 24 hours. In addition to walk-in, community and mobile crisis team transport, law enforcement may drop off people experiencing a behavioral health crisis to CSUs as a safe alternative to jail or a hospital, allowing deputies more options to connect people to care.
CSUs are designed to enable the smoothest transition possible from law enforcement engagement to care hand-off, which is less taxing on individuals; allows deputies to return quickly to the field and provides a care plan leading to less recidivism. Services at the Vista CSU, located at 524 W. Vista Way, are being provided by Exodus Recovery, Inc.
This is the second CSU the County has opened in North County. The first one, a hospital-based CSU, opened at Palomar Health in Escondido several years ago and earlier this year, doubled its capacity to 16 recliners. A third crisis stabilization unit is also slated to open in Oceanside later this year at the North Coastal Live Well Health Center and will offer 12 additional recliners.
“This is a lifesaver for North County,” said Supervisor Desmond. “I don’t say this as an exaggeration. This will save lives for those who are going through a crisis in their life, who are struggling with a burden and need the assistance to get their life back on track.”
The Crisis Stabilization Unit in vista will start serving clients Oct. 1, 2021.
The crisis stabilization units are part of the County’s efforts to expand access to behavioral health services throughout the region.
A new psychiatric health facility is also being built, in partnership with Tri-City Medical Center, on its campus in Oceanside. This facility will provide 16 beds and is expected to break ground in Spring 2022.
The County is also working with UC San Diego Health to open a large behavioral health hub in Hillcrest that will offer an array of services to the community. The new facility will be located on a County-owned property on Third Ave. that has been vacant for years.
“Following the leadership of our Board of Supervisors, and guided by direction of Dr. Bergmann, these efforts add to the array of crisis services in the North regions and are part of an expanding effort to get more people with mental illness the help they need,” said Macchione.
People needing immediate behavioral health help should call 9-1-1. Help is also available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or visiting www.Up2SD.org.

The County of San Diego broke ground Friday on the new Southeastern Live Well Center. Located at the intersection of Market Street and Euclid Avenue, the 65,000-square-foot facility will serve as a one-stop shop for health and social services for residents.
Scheduled to be completed in the summer of 2023, the Southeastern Live Well Center will provide a full array of County and community services, including medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans’ services.
The facility will also feature a 4,000-square-foot conference center, which includes a large main conference room and separate smaller meeting spaces. They will be available to the community for meetings and events.
The project will offer a wellness and meditation garden that connects to Chollas Creek Trail. Both will be open to the community seven days a week.
“We’re here today to celebrate a step forward, an investment into our community,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. “This project will stand the test of time and as we go into the future and we make this critical investment into our community, we will see the benefits of this project for decades and decades and decades to come.”
The County selected PCL Construction + Steinberg Hart for the project. They have hired two local subcontractors from the area to assist in building a facility that meets the needs of the community.
“This center has been fashioned under a new and intensive community-focused model that’s really going to serve as a blueprint for all County projects that will follow,” said HHSA Director Nick Macchione.
Friday’s event also served as a commemoration for the Tubman Chavez Community Center, which served as a community hub until it closed its doors ahead of the construction of the Southeastern Live Well Center.
﻿﻿﻿
The mural featured on the rear wall of the Tubman Chavez Community Center will be memorialized inside the new Live Well Center. The Tubman Chavez Community Center was built in 1979 and most recently served as a site for COVID-19 testing and vaccinations.
“I am honored to have worked so closely with so many dedicated residents of Southeastern San Diego to bring this project together,” said Barbara Jiménez, Community Operations Officer for the County Health and Human Services Agency. “I am convinced that the Southeastern Live Well Center will be the finest built to date in our County and grow every month and year into a welcoming and helpful neighbor for the entire community.”
The Southeastern Live Well Center will be the sixth regional community service hub. It will join existing Live Well Centers in National City, Chula Vista, Escondido, Lemon Grove and Oceanside.

747,Check Your Mood Day Goes Virtual,Getting screened for behavioral health conditions is just as important as getting your blood pressure checked or seeing your medical provider for an annual physical.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/check-your-mood-day-goes-virtual/,2021-10-04T11:00:13-07:00,"
Getting screened for behavioral health conditions is just as important as getting your blood pressure checked or seeing your medical provider for an annual physical. Unfortunately, people experiencing depression, anxiety and other mental health challenges often experience stigma and other barriers to getting care.
Annually, the County of San Diego hosts Check Your Mood Day to engage and encourage San Diegans to monitor and assess their mental well-being, as well as raise awareness about behavioral health resources. This year’s event will be held virtually on Oct. 7, in conjunction with National Depression Screening Day.
The event will provide a variety of online activities, self-care tips, and resources. Community members across the county are encouraged to take an online self-assessment and participate in a social media campaign, with actionable steps and tips to stay mentally healthy.
“The uncertainty and changes over the past 18 months due to the COVID-19 pandemic have intensified mental health challenges for many people,” said Luke Bergmann, Ph.D., director of the County’s Behavioral Health Services. “Screenings are the quickest and easiest way to spot the first signs of what could become a serious mental illness, and I encourage every San Diegan to take advantage of Check Your Mood Day.”
According to Mental Health America, nearly one in five American adults suffers from a mental illness. Despite how common depression is, many Americans don’t realize they’re experiencing the condition, or they suffer in silence out of fear of being stigmatized.
Symptoms of depression vary but include lack of energy, sadness, loss of interest in activities that previously brought joy, and trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Many signs of clinical depression are overlooked or dismissed as something that will simply pass with time.
Self-care Tips 

Safely connect with family and friends
Get outside for walks and hikes
Meditate
Stay physically active
Eat healthy, nutritious meals
Listen to music and dance

Check Your Mood Day is part of the County’s Live Well San Diego health initiative. Visit the Check Your Mood Day page for details and more mental health tips and resources.
In addition to the virtual Check Your Mood event, the County’s multilingual Access and Crisis Line is available seven days a week, 24 hours a day at (888) 724-7240 to obtain support for all behavioral health needs.

748,County Announces $9 Million in Funding for Childhood Obesity Programs,The County of San Diego and its partners announced $9 million in funding to address childhood obesity.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-announces-9-million-in-funding-for-childhood-obesity-programs/,2021-10-04T17:51:48-07:00,"
The County of San Diego and its partners announced $9 million in funding to address childhood obesity. The funding is a combination of three separate grants that will support programs that address the root causes of childhood obesity, including barriers to healthy eating and exercising.
The grants will fund the work of several organizations within the San Diego County Childhood Obesity Initiative, a public-private, multi-sector partnership bringing together over 400 entities to address youth health through a collective impact model.
“I am so proud of these partnerships we have formed as a County and the work that is being done to make sure children can live healthy lives,” said Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Nora Vargas. “It is through these partnerships that we have an opportunity to transform policies so that our communities not only have access to healthy foods but that at a young age we help kids understand the nutritional value of what they’re eating.”
The funding includes:

A $4 million COVID-19 Health Literacy grant from the US Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health that will allow COI partners to create culturally inclusive COVID-19 health literacy initiatives to support vaccination, testing, and contact tracing efforts among racial and ethnic minority and other socially vulnerable communities.
A $2 million Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded partnership between the San Diego County Office of Education and the County Health and Human Services Agency to address COVID-19 health disparities by improving the health literacy of students in traditionally underserved communities.
A $3 million grant from the California Governor’s Office of Research & Planning to address adverse childhood experiences, build resilience against stress and reduce childhood obesity in the Latino community.

“The pandemic has highlighted how health disparities have been magnified in our region, with our communities of color experiencing the worst impact,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Funding from these grants will support communities most vulnerable during the pandemic, improve access to COVID-19 resources and enhance programs related to food security and resilience against stress to support the overall health of children and their families.”
Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, 30% of local children were considered obese. According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, child and teen obesity rates further increased over the past 18 months of the pandemic.
“It is hard to eat a nutritious diet when healthy foods like fruits and vegetables are hard to afford and it is hard to be active when your neighborhood does not have enough sidewalks or parks,” said Kelly Motadel, M.D., M.P.H., County child health officer. “We need to work together to make changes that lead us to healthier living and multi-sector, public-private partnerships like the Childhood Obesity Initiative are critical to make this happen.”

The County of San Diego’s newly released 2020-21 Annual Report shows the County responding to new challenges while continuing to deliver its essential services.
Those challenges include acting to increase social justice, equity, reform, community engagement, transparency and sustainability across the breadth of County programs, to build a framework for the future and create a County that works for all people.
“We hope this Annual Report gives our residents a snapshot of all the things their County government is doing,” said County Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer. “Our top priority has always been, and remains, serving the residents of San Diego County.”  
The Annual Report breaks down County accomplishments over the past fiscal year into 10 categories: Behavioral Health, Climate Action and Sustainability, Community Investments, COVID-19 Response and Economic Recovery, Government Transparency, Health Equity, Homelessness, Housing Accessibility and Affordability, Public Safety and Justice Reform, and Racial Justice, Equity, Diversity & Inclusion.
The report notes that the County has created several new offices and departments to help it meet its new challenges. Some of those include the Office of Equity and Racial Justice; a Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities department; the Office of Environmental and Climate Justice; and a data-driven Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics to help improve how the County evaluates programs and creates policy.
Some of the highlights of the Annual Report include:

The County continued to invest money to improve behavioral health issues, from introducing Mobile Crisis Response Teams designed to help people experiencing mental health crises by dispatching behavioral health experts to emergency calls instead of law enforcement when appropriate — to the opening last week of new crisis stabilization unit in Vista.
The County put more than $134 million into an Emergency Rental Assistance Program to help thousands of renters hurt by the pandemic remain in their homes.
The County set up an Innovative Housing Trust Fund that has spent more than $50 million to create 1,397 new affordable housing units in 15 communities, and which has leveraged another $567 million in funds to be used to house low-income families, homeless veterans, people with disabilities and seniors.
The County is transforming the juvenile justice system to give young people the support they need to succeed. A key to that has included building a new Youth Transition Campus to create rehabilitative and therapeutic spaces on a campus-like setting.
The County is working to create a new Climate Action Plan and to lead a regional decarbonization effort that hopes to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2035.

The County of San Diego provides services and programs that touch the lives of nearly every person who lives in the region.
Just a few of those include providing public health services, which has gained prominence in response to the COVID-19 pandemic; law enforcement through the Sheriff’s Department; health and social services; land use in the unincorporated areas; running elections; operating County parks and the County’s 33 public libraries; investigating suspicious deaths through the County Medical Examiner’s office; monitoring beach water quality and overseeing disaster preparedness.

750,San Diego Doctors Address COVID-19 Misinformation,An independent panel of local doctors today participated in a virtual event that addressed COVID-19 misinformation brought up at the Oct. 5 County Board of Supervisors meeting.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-doctors-address-covid-19-misinformation/,2021-10-06T13:51:26-07:00,"
An independent panel of local doctors today participated in a virtual event that addressed COVID-19 misinformation brought up at the Oct. 5 County Board of Supervisors meeting.
During the 70-minute session, which was open live to the public for viewing, the doctors dispelled misleading claims about COVID-19, vaccine efficacy and approval, as well as misinformation about side effects and alternative treatments for the virus.
The panel, moderated by Dr. Eric McDonald, County chief medical officer, included Dr. Omid Bakhtar from Sharp Healthcare, Dr. Cynthia Gyamfi-Bannermann from UC San Diego Health, Dr. Christian Ramers from Family Health Centers of San Diego and Dr. Mark Sawyer from Rady Children’s Hospital.
The doctors have all worked on the front lines of COVID-19 since the pandemic’s beginning. Their discussion also included the accuracy of COVID-19 tests, the safety of the vaccines, the usefulness of masks, the efficacy of treatment options, and other issues that came up at Board of Supervisors meetings.
County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency staff are now tracking COVID-19 misinformation shared during public comment following novel coronavirus presentations to the Board of Supervisors.
HHSA staff have been in the forefront of promoting accurate information on COVID-19 throughout the pandemic, but efforts to specifically target COVID-19 misinformation began after the Board adopted a new policy, at Chair Nathan Fletcher’s request, declaring misinformation a public health crisis.
In August, San Diego County became the first jurisdiction in the United States to declare health misinformation a public health crisis, and others have since followed.
The County also has launched a new website to debunk common false claims about COVID-19 and educate people on where to find credible medical information sources
A video of the virtual event is available on the coronavirus-sd.com website. More virtual panels are expected to take place after future Board of Supervisors meeting where a COVID-19 update is provided by County staff.

752,Public Input Welcome at Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board Meeting,The public is encouraged to give feedback at the upcoming Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board meeting taking place at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday Oct. 12.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/public-input-welcome-at-citizens-law-enforcement-review-board-meeting/,2021-10-07T11:13:07-07:00,"
The public is encouraged to give feedback at the upcoming Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board meeting taking place at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday Oct. 12.
Members of the public may listen and/or participate virtually in the monthly meetings by following the steps on CLERB’s website. The agenda is available here.
CLERB was established in 1990 to increase public confidence in law enforcement by investigating citizen complaints against San Diego County Sheriff’s deputies and probation officers. The agency also investigates deaths in connection with the actions of sworn deputies and probation officers. The County Board of Supervisors expanded CLERB’s budget, staff and authority in 2020.
CLERB is committed to conducting independent, thorough, timely and impartial investigations. It makes advisory findings on complaints, and recommends policy and procedure changes to the Sheriff, Chief Probation Officer and the County Board of Supervisors.
The Board of Supervisors appointed four CLERB members on Tuesday filling ten of 11 seats. CLERB is comprised of two members from each of the five supervisorial districts and an eleventh is chosen at large from any of the districts. One seat from District One, which includes Coronado, National City, Chula Vista and Imperial Beach, remains open. Members serve three-year terms.

753,"COVID-19 Testing Sites Using Easier, Faster Process","To make it easier and faster for San Diegans to get tested for COVID-19, County-run testing sites have turned to self-swabbing – with expert instruction.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-testing-sites-using-easier-faster-process/,2021-10-07T15:04:37-07:00,"
To make it easier and faster for San Diegans to get tested for COVID-19, County-run testing sites have turned to self-swabbing – with expert instruction.
Since early September, patients at County COVID-19 testing sites have been performing the nasal swab themselves after they get instructions from a non-clinician.
“This helps makes the process more efficient for everyone,” said Denise Foster, R.N., the County’s chief nursing officer and COVID-19 clinical director. “People really like it. It gives them a sense of control.”
Self-swabbing also allows for improved social distancing between patients and County workers, Foster said. When properly done, it does not affect accuracy.
Still, if people are not comfortable swabbing their own nose, County testing sites have clinicians who are ready to step in and conduct the test.
A pilot effort in September at the Border View testing location worked well and proved popular with most customers. The County then started rolling it out to all its locations —including sites for County employees— since they were very well received.
“A very high percentage of people prefer it,” Foster said. “They feel less anxious.”
Results from a COVID-19 test at a County site are typically available within 24 to 48 hours.
If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, you are encouraged to contact your health care provider to get tested for the virus. No-cost testing is also available at several County locations across the region. You can find testing sites by day or by location.

754,"Traffic Light Backup Battery Project Could Make Residents Safer in Emergencies, Power Shutoffs",Supervisor Jim Desmond and Department of Public Works officials recently flipped the switch on a new traffic light backup battery system in San Dieguito that could eventually make residents around the county safer during emergencies.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/traffic-light-backup-battery-project-could-make-residents-safer-in-emergencies-power-shutoffs/,2021-10-08T11:21:54-07:00,"
County Supervisor Jim Desmond and Department of Public Works officials recently flipped the switch on a new traffic light backup battery system in San Dieguito that could eventually make residents around the county safer during emergencies.
The pilot project is located at a traffic light at San Dieguito Road and Via Dos Valles, an intersection that Desmond’s office said is a major evacuation route for several communities, including 4S Ranch, Carmel Valley and Rancho Bernardo.
The project replaced the traffic signal’s existing lead, acid-based backup battery — the kind you’d find in your car — that could keep the light operating for four-to-six hours in a blackout, to newer nickel-zinc batteries that can keep the light working for more than 24 hours.
Having extended backup power could keep people from blindly racing through non-working traffic signals and potentially save lives in an emergency evacuation situation or when San Diego Gas & Electric institutes a Public Safety Power Shutoff in high-wind conditions that increase wildfire risk.
“We can’t stop wildfires from occurring in San Diego County,” Desmond said, “but we can do our best to keep people safe. Seeing this backup battery’s capabilities, I’m confident this will be a major asset during Power Safety Power Shutoff events, and I look forward to seeing many more installed throughout the county.”
The Board of Supervisors, led by Desmond and Supervisor Joel Anderson, directed County staff in March to look for ways to reduce the potential impacts of Public Power Safety Shutoffs, including backup power for road infrastructure and major intersections.
Anderson was also pleased by the pilot project.
“Installing these longer-lasting emergency backup batteries at traffic lights, particularly along evacuation routes, is something that will be very important for the safety of my constituents,” said Supervisor Joel Anderson. “My constituents have lived through major wildfires in the past, including two of the largest in state history, the Cedar fire in 2003 and the Witch Creek fire in 2007.”
County public works officials said the department expects to eventually install the extended nickel-zinc backup batteries at the roughly 200 traffic lights operated on County-maintained roads in the unincorporated areas.
The San Dieguito light was chosen as a test site because it had ample space for installing up to eight nickel-zinc battery packs. The project was paid for by the vendor because the it was conducted as a test.
Public works officials said the department first installed lead-based backup batteries into traffic lights on County-maintained roads after the Sept. 8, 2011 Southwest blackout. The blackout, the largest in California history, suddenly cut power to 2.7 million customers for more than 11 hours, including all of San Diego County, parts of Mexico and Arizona, southern Orange County, Imperial Valley, Mexicali Valley and Coachella Valley.
In addition to closing schools and businesses, suspending water service in some areas, and shutting off television and radio news, the blackout also and shut off traffic lights, snarling traffic countywide.
County officials who had already seen the traffic jam impacts of the 2003 and 2007 wildfires here immediately recognized the traffic light issues presented potential future problems in emergencies.
The likelihood of traffic lights being shut off has increased in recent years after power utilities, including San Diego Gas & Electric, started using Public Safety Power Shutoffs to temporarily cut electricity in areas during “red flag” high-wind events like Santa Anas, to keep downed lines from sparking fires.
In their March 2 Board letter, Desmond and Anderson said Public Safety Power Shutoffs in 2019 turned power off in 66 communities, including in the City of San Diego and Native American reservations. In 2020, 44 communities, including seven cities and Native American reservations were affected by Public Safety Power Shutoffs.

755,Pregnant San Diego Woman Dies from COVID-19,"An unvaccinated woman is the first pregnant San Diego woman to die from COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/pregnant-san-diego-woman-dies-from-covid-19/,2021-10-08T14:32:48-07:00,"
An unvaccinated woman is the first pregnant San Diego woman to die from COVID-19, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The woman died earlier this week after being hospitalized, as did her unborn child. Her age and other details about her death and pregnancy are not being reported to protect her and her family’s privacy.
“This is a very unfortunate death, and our sincere condolences go out to the family and friends of the deceased,” said Seema Shah, M.D., medical director of HHSA’s Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch. “Contracting COVID-19 during pregnancy puts you at greater risk of having serious complications and death. We urge anyone who is pregnant and unvaccinated to get immunized to protect themselves and their babies.”
On Oct. 6, the County Health and Human Services Agency issued a health alert to the local medical community alerting them of an increase in cases and hospitalizations of unvaccinated pregnant women, and encouraging them to urge their patients to get vaccinated.
From June 1, 2021 through Sept. 30, there have been 253 laboratory-confirmed cases among pregnant people, including 203 among those not fully vaccinated compared to 50 who were fully vaccinated. Of the 253, a total of 31 required hospitalization; 30 of those hospitalized were not fully vaccinated.
Not fully vaccinated is defined as being unvaccinated or having received a single dose of Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines. Fully vaccinated is defined as being 14-days after the 2nd dose of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines or a single dose of Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
In late September, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a health advisory strongly recommending that people get vaccinated against COVID-19 either before, during or after pregnancy —including those who are breast-feeding — because the benefits of vaccination outweigh known and potential risks.
According to the CDC, pregnant people who contract and develop symptoms from COVID-19 “have a two-fold risk of admission into intensive care and a 70% increased risk of death.”
“This is heartbreaking and tragic news that a pregnant mother and her unborn baby have died from this terrible disease,” said Dr. Joanna Adamczak, a maternal-fetal specialist and chief medical officer of Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women & Newborns. “We, as health care providers, urgently encourage anyone who is pregnant, or plans to get pregnant, to get the vaccine. It provides important protection for both mom and baby.”
There are over 400 locations where San Diegans can get vaccinated against COVID-19. They include doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies (Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS, etc.), community clinics and County public health centers.
Nearly 80% of eligible San Diegans are now fully vaccinated. There is plenty of COVID-19 vaccine available in the region for San Diegans who are eligible and due for a booster shot and for San Diegans who have not yet been vaccinated. You can also find a complete list of locations at coronavirus-sd.com.

757,Shigella outbreak reported in City of San Diego individuals experiencing homelessness,"The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is monitoring an outbreak of at least six cases of shigellosis in individuals experiencing homelessness since Sept. 30, 2021. The cases were found after the individuals were hospitalized. They are expected to recover.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/shigella-outbreak-reported-in-city-of-san-diego-individuals-experiencing-homelessness/,2021-10-11T18:57:25-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is monitoring an outbreak of at least six cases of shigellosis in individuals experiencing homelessness since Sept. 30, 2021.
The cases were found after the individuals were hospitalized. They are expected to recover.
The County has notified the City of San Diego and will work with the city and potential exposure sites and homeless service providers to ensure good hygienic precautions, identify any additional cases and connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.
A health advisory to local providers also has also been issued.
“Shigellosis isn’t usually serious, but in the wrong circumstances it can spread, and we want to ensure this vulnerable population is kept safe,” said Seema Shah, M.D., medical director of HHSA’s Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch.
Shigellosis is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or sometimes person-to-person such as men who have sex with men (MSMs). In 2020, the County identified 243 total cases; to date in 2021, the County has identified 220.
Although only a small number of organisms can make a person sick, casual contact is not the main way shigellosis bacteria are spread. Typical symptoms include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps.
The infection is diagnosed with stool testing. Most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, though individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease. If you have symptoms that resemble shigellosis, contact your primary care physician for assistance.

758,County’s Edgemoor Named One of America’s Best Nursing Homes,"Once again, the County Health and Human Services Agency’s Edgemoor Skilled Nursing Facility has been named  one of the best facilities of its kind in the state and the nation by Newsweek magazine.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-edgemoor-named-one-of-americas-best-nursing-homes/,2021-10-12T10:02:51-07:00,"
Once again, the County Health and Human Services Agency’s Edgemoor Skilled Nursing Facility has been named one of the best facilities of its kind in the state and the nation by Newsweek magazine.
This is the third time Newsweek has ranked Edgemoor as one of the top places in California and the United States. The magazine gave the facility the top ranking in the state in 2019 and 2020.
This year, the magazine analyzed nursing homes in 25 states with the highest population size and chose 450 winners.
For its list of America’s Best Nursing Homes 2022, the magazine looked at three critical criteria in creating its ranking: overall performance data, peer recommendations and each facility’s handling of COVID-19.
“It’s no surprise. At Edgemoor, we provide the highest level of care to seriously ill and injured adult patients who require long-term care, and it has not gone unnoticed,” said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency.

Under the umbrella of County Behavioral Health Services, Edgemoor patients receive 24-hour skilled nursing care, physical rehabilitation, as well as recreational, occupational and speech therapy. Patients at the 192-bed facility require specialized interventions from highly trained staff.
“Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve taken every precaution to make our residents stay safe and healthy,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services. “Nursing home residents are particularly vulnerable to this virus, and I’m extremely proud of the work and commitment of both the Edgemoor staff and our guests to everyone’s safety in these challenging times.”
The commitment of the staff at Edgemoor embodies the County’s approach to service and exemplifies the Live Well San Diego vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
“The doctors, nurses and everyone else working at Edgemoor make every effort to provide exceptional care for our patients,” said Erin Chancler, Edgemoor’s administrator. “It’s a well-deserved recognition given everyone’s commitment and dedication.”
The latest Newsweek ranking adds to the national recognition Edgemoor has received for providing top-quality treatment and services. Edgemoor is a five-star facility, having received this highest rating from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for quality services.

759,Influenza Sickening More San Diegans This Season,"The number of influenza cases being reported in the region this season is higher than the average for this same time in recent years, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/influenza-sickening-more-san-diegans-this-season/,2021-10-13T10:40:47-07:00,"
The number of influenza cases being reported in the region this season is higher than the average for this same time in recent years, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
A total of 195 lab-confirmed influenza cases have been reported so far this season. That compared to six at the same time last year, but that extremely low number came while many COVID-19 restrictions were still in place. The prior five-year average was 128 cases to date.
Given this season’s pace, County health officials are urging San Diegans to get their flu vaccination before influenza activity increases in the region.
“San Diegans should get vaccinated as soon as possible to protect themselves and their families,” says Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Getting a flu shot is especially important given that COVID-19 is still negatively impacting our communities. Influenza and COVID-19 can both be significant respiratory illnesses and we have safe and effective vaccines for both. You can even get a flu and COVID shot at the same time.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency has begun publishing the weekly Influenza Watch  report, which tracks key influenza indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region. The report is released every Wednesday during the flu season.
Your Best Shot Against the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop.
“Flu vaccination is especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from influenza,” Kaiser said.
The following groups are more likely get seriously sick from the flu:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
Tips to Prevent the Flu
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

Last season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

The milestone places San Diego among the most vaccinated counties in the state and the nation.
“San Diegans have done a great job getting vaccinated against COVID-19,” said Seema Shah, M.D., medical director for HHSA’s Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch. “However, we should not get complacent. The COVID-19 pandemic is not over and those who are immunocompromised, ineligible or otherwise vulnerable need our collective protection. Eligible residents should continue getting vaccinated and get their booster shot when it’s their turn.”
More than 400 locations countywide offer no-cost COVID-19 vaccinations. They include doctors’ offices, retail pharmacies (Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS, etc.), community clinics and County public health centers.
“Local health care providers and many other County partners have made a tremendous effort to encourage San Diegans to get vaccinated and to make the vaccine available to anyone who wants it,” Shah said.
Vaccine supplies remain plentiful, both for those seeking initial doses and boosters for those who received the Pfizer vaccine and meet the criteria. A complete list of locations and booster eligibility details are at coronavirus-sd.com.

762,County Library High School Celebrates Largest Graduation Yet,"High school graduation is always special, but this year’s County Library High School graduation went above and beyond.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-library-high-school-celebrates-largest-graduation-yet/,2021-10-15T15:54:39-07:00,"
High school graduation is always special, but this year’s County Library High School graduation went above and beyond. Three sets of new graduates received their diplomas Thursday evening — fall 2019 students who finished school after that year’s graduation ceremony, 2020 grads whose ceremony was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic and 2021’s graduates.
And it wasn’t just a memorable occasion for the graduates; it was also special for the Library High School Program, which celebrated its largest ceremony since the program began in 2016. Thirty-three students donned caps and gowns to receive their diplomas at Spreckel’s Organ Pavilion in Balboa Park.
The County Library High School program gives students 18 years and older a way to earn high school diplomas through a nationally recognized program. It’s online, and students are able to go at their own pace. Classes are free.
Roughly 13% of adults in San Diego County don’t have high school diplomas. Some had to quit school to go to work or they faced circumstances that prevented them from completing high school. Library High School gives them another chance, one that allows them to work around their regular schedule.
“We are incredibly proud of our students, who placed their trust in San Diego County Library and dedicated their time and resources to obtaining a much-deserved high school diploma,” said San Diego County Library Director Migell Acosta. “These students worked at their studies after work, or after the children went to bed. Library High School opens an important door into new careers and supports the County Library’s vision of equitable access for all.”
Any resident of San Diego County can apply for the program and students are accepted year-round. They can transfer up to 14 credits from their former high school and complete the online courses in five to 18 months. Students may also work toward a career certificate in any of eight different fields.
Would-be students can apply online. They must take a prerequisite course to see if online learning would work for them and then the Library conducts virtual interviews before accepting applicants. Once enrolled, the student is provided with an online academic coach to help guide the student to be successful.
The program doesn’t award a general education diploma, known as a GED, but an actual high school diploma which allows for more opportunities to qualify for higher education and job opportunities. The County’s Department of Child Support Services partners with the program to refer potential students, enabling participants to further their education and improve employment prospects. Ten of those students were among the graduates Thursday.
The County’s Library High School is operated by Smart Horizons Career Online High School, an accredited, private national online school district. Since 2016, 99 people have graduated from the County’s online high school.

763,Shigella Outbreak Update for People Experiencing Homelessness,"The County of San Diego has announced 11 new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 15 confirmed and three probable among individuals experiencing homelessness.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/shigella-outbreak-update-for-people-experiencing-homelessness/,2021-10-19T16:15:51-07:00,"
The County of San Diego has announced 11 new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 15 confirmed and three probable among individuals experiencing homelessness.
The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between Aug. 16 and Oct. 14. The 18 cases in this outbreak represent 6.8 percent of the 266 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.
The cases are all among individuals experiencing homelessness who resided at multiple locations in central San Diego. No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.
The County is working closely with the City of San Diego to:

Identify potential exposure sites.
Promote good hygienic precautions among homeless service providers and food providers.
Identify additional cases.
Connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.

Other steps include:

Relocation of currently deployed handwashing stations to areas frequented by homeless individuals and evaluation of need for additional stations.
Increased cleaning of portable and fixed public bathrooms.
Increased sidewalk sanitization from twice weekly to seven days per week for the time being. Frequency will be continually assessed.
Notification by the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality about the outbreak – and precautions – to food facilities in the downtown area, charitable feeding operators, the California Restaurant Association, Downtown San Diego Partnership and Gaslamp Quarter Association.
Public health nurses conducting outreach at shelters.
Homeless Outreach Teams distributing Shigella information as part of hygiene kits given to persons experiencing homelessness, including an extra 600 the week of Oct. 18.

Shigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person-to-person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation, and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.
Typical symptoms include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.  People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.
Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.
More information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

764,County Probation to Launch New Program for Longer-Term In-Custody Youth and Young Adults,The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to begin the implementation of the Youth Development Academy at the East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility by 2023.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-probation-to-launch-new-program-for-longer-term-in-custody-youth-and-young-adults/,2021-10-19T17:39:03-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to begin the implementation of the Youth Development Academy at the East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility by 2023.
The action is in response to Senate Bill 823, which transfers responsibility from the state to county probation departments for longer-term custody of youth up to age 25.
As part of the plan, the San Diego County Probation Department, County Behavioral Health Services, and a contractor will provide more intensive rehabilitative, longer-term services for in-custody youth who have committed the most serious and violent offenses.
“This means our staff training, treatment, and daily programming will change for a population that is older and will spend more time in custody than we’ve previously experienced. What won’t change is our commitment to treating these young people as adolescents, not adults since adolescent brain science tells us that brains don’t finish developing until the mid-20s,” said Interim Chief Probation Officer Cesar Escuro. “We have a final, unique opportunity to support justice-involved young people by providing clinical support, education, and career development services that can help them permanently exit the justice system and thrive.”
The program will include career and academic support services, positive youth development programming, behavioral health treatment programming, reentry support, and support for families to participate in care. Long-term needs for post-high school academic and career development services would also be identified for the program youth. The youth will be at the East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility in two living units, which will be renovated to be more home-like in preparation for longer use.
Currently, the state’s Division of Juvenile Justice takes custody of these youth in another program that is separate from the adult population and will end in 2023. The program typically has 50 to 55 youth in that program throughout a year.
In this decade, San Diego County Probation has transformed its approach to justice-involved youth. To do this, Probation has enhanced its prevention, early intervention, and diversion strategies by including more direct mental health and trauma services, deepening collaboration with school districts, and supporting the needs of the entire family.
The positive outcomes of this are a nearly 70% reduction in Probation’s juvenile detention population and a 75% reduction of those on community supervision in the last seven years.

765,County Approves Move to Vote Center Model,"The Board of Supervisors Tuesday unanimously approved having San Diego join 25 other counties statewide in implementing a vote center model, beginning with the June 2022 gubernatorial primary election.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-approves-move-to-vote-center-model/,2021-10-19T18:27:14-07:00,"
The Board of Supervisors Tuesday unanimously approved having San Diego join 25 other counties statewide in implementing a vote center model, beginning with the June 2022 gubernatorial primary election.
The California Voter’s Choice Act paved the way for counties to move from traditional polling places to vote centers when it was enacted in 2016.
Under the act, every active registered voter will automatically receive a ballot in the mail and will have options for how to return their ballot: by mail, to a secure ballot drop box, or vote in person at any vote center.
The concept won’t be entirely new to local voters. The Registrar of Voters used a similar format for the November 2020 presidential general and September 2021 gubernatorial recall elections. More than 200 voting locations opened throughout San Diego County and allowed voters four days to cast their ballot in person.
The vote-by-mail trend in California has reduced the use of traditional polling places, driving counties to the vote center model. Nearly 80% of the County’s 1.97 million registered voters are permanent vote-by-mail voters.
“When the June 2022 election cycle rolls around, more than 13 million registered voters in California – nearly 62% of the state’s voters – will be using the vote center model,” said Interim Registrar of Voters Cynthia Paes. “Tuesday’s Board action will add San Diego County’s nearly 2 million registered voters to the mix.”
The number of vote centers is based on total voter registration. The law requires one for every 50,000 voters for 11 days and one for every 10,000 voters for four days.
In San Diego County, current registration figures mean a minimum of 197 vote centers would open for four days including election day. Forty of the 197 would open an additional seven days for a total of 11 days.
The County will ask for public input on the locations and will consider a variety of factors to ensure registered voters have equal opportunities to cast their ballot.
The new model also streamlines the election process for the Registrar’s office. Voters will no longer have an assigned polling place and can visit any voter center. Election workers at the vote centers will use state-certified electronic poll books to look up the same information available at the Registrar’s office. Polling places did not have this capability, requiring some voters to cast provisional ballots. Verifying provisional ballots can take two weeks or more after election day.
Vote center services will include:

Touchscreen ballot marking devices with every ballot type
Voting assistance, including assistance in multiple languages
Voter registration allowing voters to cast a ballot the same day
Voter registration updates
Request a replacement ballot

The Board also voted to fund secure mail ballot drop boxes throughout the County. Based on the number of current registered voters, the Registrar must provide 132 ballot drop-off sites starting 29 days before the election. Vote centers would also act as drop-off sites.

766,San Diegans Urged to Get Flu Vaccination,"Given that most places have reopened and people have resumed many normal routines and activities, County health officials are concerned this year’s flu season might be more severe.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-get-flu-vaccination/,2021-10-20T11:53:10-07:00,"
Mask wearing, physical distancing and COVID-19 preventive measures helped to greatly reduce the number of influenza cases reported in the region last year.
However, given that most places have reopened and people have resumed many normal routines and activities, County health officials are concerned this year’s flu season might be more severe.
“San Diegans are more likely to be out and about this flu season and that could lead to more people getting sick from influenza,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “The best protection we have against the flu is getting vaccinated. The vaccine is safe and effective and can help prevent people from getting sick, ending up in the hospital or, worse, dying.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency has begun publishing the weekly Influenza Watch report, which tracks key influenza indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region. The report is released every Wednesday during the flu season.
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Oct. 16, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (there were no deaths at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 215 (compared to 7 last season and an average of 145 at this date for the past five years)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

767,County: $1.8 Mill Available to Youth Sports and Camps to Cut Kids’ Registration Fees,"The County’s Department of Parks and Recreation wants to give youth sports and camp programs shares of $1.8 million to help get 15,000 to 20,000 kids back out to play in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-1-8-mill-available-to-youth-sports-and-camps-to-cut-kids-registration-fees/,2021-10-20T14:18:26-07:00,"
The County’s Department of Parks and Recreation wants to give youth sports and camp programs shares of $1.8 million to help get 15,000 to 20,000 kids back out to play in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The County’s Board of Supervisors approved using $1.8 million in American Rescue Plan Act funds earlier this month to reduce or eliminate sports and camp registration fees for children. The action recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic created financial hardships for many families and businesses that could keep children out of sports and camp activities.
How to Apply
Youth sports and camp programs in unincorporated communities can apply for shares of the money at one of two reimbursement levels — up to $50 or $100 per youth participant — by filling out an online application form.
Programs must meet a handful of criteria to be eligible.

They must be operators of recreational youth sports or camps.
They must run those activities in an unincorporated community, including schools, or at a County-owned property.
They must have valid federal and/or state tax identifications.

Businesses and organizations that receive funding must use it to reduce registration fees for youth who want to attend their camps and programs.
County officials expect the program will reduce or eliminate registration fees for 15,000 to 20,000 youth in camps and programs including: soccer, art/dance camps, football, cheer camps, baseball, softball and gymnastics.
Helping Out in an Equitable Way
Parks will prioritize two-thirds of the programs funding — $1.2 million — to help teens and youth who live in areas that were likely to be the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, using the state’s Healthy Places Index as a guide. The Healthy Places Index rates census tracts within counties and gives them numerical scores to determine how healthy or unhealthy they are based on six metrics: economics, education, housing, health care access, neighborhood and clean environment.
The program will provide the $1.2 million to cover up to $100 per participant, to organizations and camps serving youth in the lower two quartiles of the Healthy Place Index.
Participants, facilities, and organizations in the upper quartiles would also be eligible for partial waivers and reimbursements, up to $50 per participant.
Parks officials said because youth sports and camp registration periods vary and often come months ahead of the actual events, Parks will reimburse organizations in two batches to ensure reimbursement helps youth and teens who actually participate in camps and programs, rather than estimates based on early sign-up projections.
For more information about the program and how to take part, go to the Parks Department’s website.

COVID-19 vaccination boosters are now recommended and available for everyone who qualifies.
Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved booster shots for all three COVID-19 vaccines currently available. However, the time frame for when people should get a booster depends on which vaccine you received.
For people who were vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, the CDC indicates the following groups are eligible for a booster shot at 6 months or more after their initial series:

65 years and older
Age 18+ who live in long-term care settings
Age 18+ who have underlying medical conditions
Age 18+ who work or live in high-risk settings

For San Diegans who got the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, booster shots are also recommended for people 18 and older and who were vaccinated at least two months ago.
While all three available COVID-19 vaccines have now been approved as boosters, people should stick to the vaccine they originally received. However, they may choose a different one if necessary.
“People should go with their past vaccine, when possible,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “They all continue to be very effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization and death, even against the Delta variant which is widely circulating.”
Vaccine supplies remain plentiful, both for those seeking initial doses and boosters for those who meet the criteria. People can get a booster through their medical provider, a retail pharmacy or a site operated by the County. Additional booster eligibility details are at coronavirus-sd.com.

774,San Diegans Urged to Get Flu Vaccine in Time for Holidays,The County of San Diego is ramping up its flu vaccination efforts to lower the risk of San Diegans getting influenza this holiday season.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-get-flu-vaccine-in-time-for-holidays/,2021-10-27T10:50:09-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is ramping up its flu vaccination efforts to lower the risk of San Diegans getting influenza this holiday season. County health officials are concerned this year’s flu season will be more severe than last year, when many people were staying at home due to COVID-19.
While influenza cases are still low in the region at the moment, it takes about two weeks after vaccination to develop protection against the virus. That’s why it’s best to get vaccinated before influenza starts to spread in the community.
“The upcoming Halloween festivities are a great reminder that the holiday season and the increased gatherings it brings are right around the corner,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.  “This holiday season, protect yourself and others by getting a flu shot. It’s the best way to protect yourself from influenza.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Oct. 23, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (there were no deaths at this time last season)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 229 (compared to 10 last season and an average of 163 at this date for the past five years)

Preventing the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

Hoping to help sow the seeds of sustainable, nutritional living, County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher, Vice Chair Nora Vargas, master gardeners and County staff opened a new demonstration garden at the County Operations Center Wednesday.
Fletcher and Vargas marked the event by planting the first plants — Italian parsley and chrysanthemums — in the garden that was developed by the master gardeners and the County’s Live Well San Diego Food System Initiative.
The 400-square-foot demonstration garden was designed to be a working example of the Food System Initiative’s goals, to showcase “a little bit of everything” to promote home, urban and community gardening, and its connection to sustainability.
In addition to growing seasonal fruits and vegetables, herbs, citrus, a wide variety of popular plants, and even native Californian plants, the County plans to use the garden as an educational space. There will be classes and workshops to learn about gardening, composting and other topics connected to sustainability and nutrition.
Fletcher and Vargas said home and neighborhood gardens provide a multitude of benefits, from improving the food system and addressing food insecurity, to cultivating better nutrition, creating a sense of community and promoting healthy living.
“We can empower communities through food,” Fletcher said, “and bring them together with accessible community gardens. When we can gather together to grow our own food, it is not only a rewarding activity but also has tremendous economic and environmental benefits. I see gardens as an opportunity to build a stronger safety net for all San Diegans and create a more inclusive and resilient food and farm economy.”
Vargas said gardens can create a sense of community and promote social engagement among families and neighbors, in addition to giving people the opportunity to get outside, live active lifestyles and connect with nature.
“The power of community gardens, the way they help build our communities’ resilience and improve not only physical and mental health outcomes, especially in food insecure communities, it really is powerful,” Vargas said. “It is my hope that this demonstration garden … will inspire others to plant their own gardens in their neighborhoods.”
The garden features four raised planting beds, including one that is accessible to people in wheelchairs, a demonstration rain barrel and compost-worm bin, and will eventually be watered by a drip irrigation system. It will also include a container garden, a flowering “pollinator” bed to attract bees, butterflies and ladybugs, and will use the County Operations Center’s existing composting system to recharge the garden’s soil.
There will be signs in multiple languages with information about gardening and nutrition, resources to healthy food, and even a Little Free Library outside the garden’s gate.
You can learn more about the garden and its future events at the Demonstration Garden’s webpage. For more information about the Food System Initiative go to the Live Well San Diego Food System Initiative webpage.

777,Disaster Loans Available for Small Businesses Economically Impacted by the Pipeline Oil Spill,The U.S. Small Business Administration is offering low-interest federal disaster loans to small businesses that were economically impacted by the pipeline oil spill which began Oct. 2. A virtual business recovery center opens Oct. 28 for help in determining eligibility.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/disaster-loans-available-for-small-businesses-economically-impacted-by-the-pipeline-oil-spill/,2021-10-28T15:43:43-07:00,"
The U.S. Small Business Administration is offering low-interest federal disaster loans to small businesses that were economically impacted by the pipeline oil spill which began Oct. 2. A virtual business recovery center opens Oct. 28 for help in determining eligibility.
The SBA acted under its own authority to declare a disaster in response to a request from the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, SBA’s Administrator Isabella Casillas Guzman said.
The disaster declaration makes SBA assistance available in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. The deadline to apply for economic injury is July 27, 2022.
“Small nonfarm businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture and most private nonprofit organizations of any size may qualify for Economic Injury Disaster Loans of up to $2 million to help meet financial obligations and operating expenses which could have been met had the disaster not occurred,” said Tanya Garfield, director of SBA’s Disaster Field Operations Center-West.
“These loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable and other bills that can’t be paid because of the disaster’s impact. Disaster loans can provide vital economic assistance to small businesses to help overcome the temporary loss of revenue they are experiencing,” she added.
Eligibility is based on the financial impact of the disaster only and not on any actual property damage. These loans have an interest rate of 2.855 percent for small businesses and 2 percent for private nonprofit organizations with terms up to 30 years and are restricted to small businesses without the financial ability to offset the adverse impact without hardship.
“SBA’s mission-driven team stands ready to help California small businesses impacted by the pipeline oil spill,” said Administrator Guzman. “We’re committed to providing federal disaster loans swiftly and efficiently, with a customer-centric approach to help businesses and communities recover and rebuild.”
In consideration of the public health concerns due to the Coronavirus pandemic, SBA has established a Virtual Business Recovery Center to answer questions about SBA’s disaster loan program, explain the application process and help individuals complete their electronic loan application.
Applicants may apply online, receive additional disaster assistance information, and download applications at https://disasterloanassistance.sba.gov/. Applicants may also call SBA’s Customer Service Center at (800) 659-2955 or email disastercustomerservice@sba.gov for more information on SBA disaster assistance. Individuals who are deaf or hard‑of‑hearing may call (800) 877-8339. Completed applications should be mailed to U.S. Small Business Administration, Processing and Disbursement Center, 14925 Kingsport Road, Fort Worth, TX  76155.

The County of San Diego has announced two new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 26 confirmed and three probable cases among people experiencing homelessness.
The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between Aug. 16 and Oct. 21, with the three new cases occurring between Oct. 18 and Oct. 21. The 29 cases in this outbreak represent 9% of the 295 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.
The cases are all among individuals experiencing homelessness with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego. Three cases outside the City of San Diego are now under investigation. No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.
The County is working closely with the City of San Diego to:

Identify potential exposure sites.
Promote good hygienic precautions among homeless service providers and food providers.
Identify additional cases.
Connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.

Other steps include:

Relocation of 32 currently deployed handwashing stations to areas frequented by homeless individuals.
Placement of 15 new handwashing stations. Evaluation of additional need is ongoing.
Increased cleaning of portable and fixed public bathrooms.
Evaluating potential placements of new portable restrooms.
Increased sidewalk sanitization from twice weekly to seven days per week for the time being. Frequency will be continually assessed.

The County is assembling an additional 1,000 hygiene kits to distribute to people experiencing homelessness outside of central San Diego.

Shigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.
Typical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.  People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.
Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.
More information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The San Diego County Probation Department received a $335,000 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to provide more intensive monitoring for people convicted of driving under the influence.
“Our monitoring program helps probationers stay on track with treatment and other court-ordered measures,” San Diego County Interim Probation Chief Cesar Escuro said. “The goal is that with additional guidance and help, it will reduce the number of probationers who are arrested or cited again for DUI.”
The grant will help fund regular and frequent check-ins with high-risk, felony and repeat DUI offenders. Probation officers monitor the person’s compliance with their treatment plan, DUI program participation, court orders, and their substance abuse by conducting frequent alcohol and drug testing, and home visits during non-traditional and evening hours, weekends, and holidays.
“Prevention and treatment are valuable tools in reducing DUI recidivism rates,” OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. “Monitoring programs are intended to steer probationers in the right direction.”
The probation grant will also pay for operations targeting probation violations, alcohol testing, officer training in Standard Field Sobriety Testing and collaborating with courts and prosecutors to establish probation orders.
The grant program runs through September 2022. Funding for the OTS grant program is provided through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

781,San Diego Could See Severe Flu Season,"The number of influenza cases being reported this season continues to outpace the average identified at the same time the past five years, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-could-see-severe-flu-season/,2021-11-03T14:46:24-07:00,"
The number of influenza cases being reported this season continues to outpace the average identified at the same time the past five years, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
For the week ending Oct. 30, a total of 28 influenza cases were reported in San Diego compared to the previous five-year average of 19 during the same week. To date, 257 flu cases have been reported in the region, compared to an annual average of 182 over the past five years.
“This increase of cases comes at a time when people are interacting and gathering indoors more than last year, and fewer San Diegans have gotten the flu vaccine compared to last season,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The best way to lower your risk of getting influenza is to get vaccinated.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Oct. 30, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (there were no deaths at this time last season)
Total people who have been vaccinated to date: 690,617 (compared to 770,054 at the same time last season)

Preventing the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

782,Children Ages 5-11 Now Eligible for COVID-19 Vaccine,COVID-19 vaccinations are now available to San Diego children age 5 and older.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/children-ages-5-11-now-eligible-for-covid-19-vaccine/,2021-11-03T15:10:37-07:00,"
COVID-19 vaccinations are now available to San Diego children ages 5 and older.
The California Department of Public Health has approved Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for use in 5- to 11-year-olds, and health care providers in the region are now vaccinating children in this age group.
“Clinical trials have shown that the Pfizer vaccine is both safe and effective for use in children,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Getting this newly eligible age group vaccinated will allow kids and their families to return to a more normal daily life and will protect younger siblings who are not eligible to be vaccinated yet.”
The Pfizer vaccine is the only COVID-19 vaccine currently authorized for use in 5- to 11-year-olds and 12- to 17-year-olds. Parents should take their children ages 5 to 11 to their primary pediatrician for a vaccine, but if that is not an option, the majority of County-operated COVID-19 vaccination sites also carry the Pfizer vaccine, as do many pharmacies, clinics and other medical providers. Parents can also visit MyTurn.ca.gov or call the hotline at 833-422-4255 beginning tomorrow to find a nearby vaccination site.
A child gets vaccinated against COVID-19 at Rady Children’s Hospital.
Children in the newly eligible 5- to 11-year-old group will receive a two-dose regimen three weeks apart. The vaccine will be administered with smaller needles, and doses will contain only a third of the dosage compared to what is being administered to teens and adults.
“While the risk of children dying from COVID-19 is much lower than it is for adults, kids now make up about one in five cases here in the County,” said Kelly Motadel, M.D., M.P.H., County child health officer. “Despite often showing only minor symptoms while they are ill, kids are at risk, while lower than adults, of developing long COVID and suffering debilitating long-term effects from the virus.”
Parental consent is required prior to vaccination for anyone under the age of 18. In addition to parental consent, minors must be accompanied to the vaccination appointment by a parent, guardian, or caregiver to verify the child’s age and identity.
State figures show San Diego County has 322,774 children ages 5-11, and the County has plenty of vaccine doses on hand or coming in to vaccinate all eligible youths in the coming weeks.
Additional information about scheduling appointments and what types of documentation children will need to get vaccinated is available at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Looking to energize solar electricity projects in unincorporated areas, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to shorten the approval process for battery storage projects located in industrial areas.
Battery storage projects can help pave the way for San Diego County’ s electrical distribution grid to take on more renewable electricity, like from solar electricity generated by solar panels on homes and businesses during daylight hours.
The Board voted to direct County staff to draft and bring back Zoning Ordinance changes for it to consider that would ease permitting and shorten approval time by two to four months for battery storage projects. The changes would apply to battery projects located in areas that fall within two of the County’s industrial zone classifications, where they would be situated with other industrial/commercial businesses.
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher said the County has set an aggressive, lofty goal of generating 100% renewable energy in the unincorporated area by 2030 and that this move was just one of “a lot of things” the County was doing to try to reach that goal.
The changes will be included in a cleanup of the County Zoning Ordinance that is scheduled to begin in July 2022 and completed by July 2023.
The Board also directed Planning & Development Services staff to bring additional information back to it for consideration, including:

Options in the permitting process that would continue to allow public involvement and input in the review of applications for battery storage projects
An evaluation of whether the County could use additional personnel to process renewable energy projects

The Board also directed County staff to continue working with stakeholders on how to properly decommission used solar batteries.

789,County’s Focus on Health Equity Saving Lives,Health equity is making sure social position doesn’t prevent people from reaching their full health potential.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-focus-on-health-equity-saving-lives/,2021-11-08T10:02:22-08:00,"
Health equity.
This goal has been a priority for the County Health and Human Services Agency for over a decade, but it has gained new attention as part of efforts to address the full spectrum of social justice.
Health equity is making sure social position doesn’t prevent people from reaching their full health potential.
HHSA established the Chronic Disease and Health Equity Unit to create environments and policies to help all residents thrive and minimize the impact of chronic diseases.
The unit works with residents, schools, businesses, and leaders on policy to change the systems that keep some people from having a fair and equal opportunity to be healthy.
“We’re trying to change the environment where people live,” said Naomi Billups, public health nutrition manager for HHSA. “People do not want to not be able to afford healthy food. They do not want to live in an area where their children can’t go out and play or there’s not enough access to healthy foods.”
Since 2010, the Chronic Disease and Health Equity Unit has led the effort to build better health in the region, a component of Live Well San Diego, the County of San Diego’s vision for healthy, safe, and thriving residents and communities.
The goal is to reduce and prevent chronic diseases by making healthy living easier and more affordable in the places where people live, work, learn and play.
However, not every neighborhood enjoys the advantages of healthy choices, such as access to fresh, locally grown food, safe physical activity options or smoke-free environments.
“We have a duty as a government, and as people, to reverse the systems that don’t allow the same opportunity for everyone,” said Billups.
As an example, Billups was part of the effort to get the City of San Diego to adjust its urban agriculture ordinance. That has resulted in more community gardens and recreational facilities and residents being able to be beekeepers and raise goats and chickens in their own backyards.
County public health nutrition manager keeps three goats for milk.
“People want the ability to have hens for eggs and goats for milk,” said Billups, a City Heights resident. She is part of a small co-op that keeps three goats, several chickens and two donkeys at City Farmers Nursery, a place she visits daily to milk the goats, collect the eggs and clean their pens. Billups says she gets all the milk and eggs she needs and the extras she gives to people in her community.
3-4-50
Billups was recently named the 2021 Community Change Agent by RISE San Diego. She received the award in partnership with the Nonprofit Institute at the University of San Diego.
“I am very humbled,” said Billups. “The award gives me hope, but there’s tons more to be done.”
Billups received the award for her effort to have a positive impact in the three behaviors that lead to chronic disease.
Tobacco use, poor nutrition, and physical inactivity contribute to four major chronic diseases — cancer, heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, and lung disease — that lead to more than 50 percent of deaths in the county, a concept referred to as “3-4-50.”
In 2010, about 57 percent of San Diegans were dying from the four major conditions. Eleven years later and thanks in part to Live Well San Diego and the Chronic Disease and Health Equity Unit, that figured has dropped seven percentage points.
“We’re seeing some progress in the fight against chronic disease, but thousands of San Diegans are still dying from these preventable diseases,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Small changes can make a big difference in individuals, families and communities and can lead to a better quality of life.”

No stranger to running local elections, Interim Registrar Cynthia Paes has now been appointed as the new San Diego County Registrar of Voters.
Paes has been acting as interim registrar since January and has shepherded her team through four elections, including the recent statewide gubernatorial recall election.
Paes also successfully launched several firsts after the Board of Supervisors decided to move the County to the Voters Choice Act.
All of the County’s 1.97 million voters received mail-in ballots during the recall election. Assigned polling places were replaced with voting locations allowing voters to cast their ballot at any one of more than 200 sites and ballot marking devices were introduced to all in-person voters.
“She has more than thirty elections under her belt and will continue the County’s excellent record of administering fair, accurate, accessible, transparent and secure elections with the highest level of care and integrity,” said Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer.
Paes will also continue to foster community engagement efforts to ensure every qualified individual can gain access to the voting process and learn their many options for casting a ballot.
Paes started with the County in 2002 with the Health and Human Services Agency. In 2011, she became the Chief Deputy of the Election Services Division and within two years, she was promoted to Assistant Registrar of Voters. She became the interim registrar when the former registrar, Michael Vu, became the County’s assistant chief administrative officer.
Paes has a Master of Public Administration degree from California State University, Stanislaus and is a Certified Elections/Registration Administrator with the National Association of Elections Officials.

792,"County COVID-19 Vaccination Totals Include Children Ages 5 and Older, Boosters",The number of children ages 5 through 11 who have received a COVID-19 vaccine and the total number of people who have gotten a booster shot will now be reflected in the local COVID-19 vaccination reports and dashboards.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-covid-19-vaccination-totals-include-children-ages-5-and-older-boosters/,2021-11-10T17:50:58-08:00,"
The number of children ages 5 through 11 who have received a COVID-19 vaccine and the total number of people who have gotten a booster shot will now be reflected in the local COVID-19 vaccination reports and dashboards.
Through Nov. 9, a total of 279,293 San Diegans had received a COVID-19 booster and 7,320 children ages 5 through 11 had received their first shot of the Pfizer vaccine, the only one approved for this age group.
“It’s great that San Diegans are getting their booster shots and that parents are vaccinating their children. This will help to reduce the spread of COVID-19 as we enter the holiday season and into 2022,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The more people who are vaccinated, the better off we’ll be at putting this pandemic behind us.”
COVID-19 vaccines for all eligible ages and booster shots are available at health care providers, retail pharmacies, clinics and other medical providers. Appointments can be made at myturn.ca.gov or by calling (833) 422-4255.

793,Update: Shigella Outbreak in San Diego County — 11-12-2021,"The County of San Diego has announced four new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 35 confirmed and three probable cases among people experiencing homelessness.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/update-shigella-outbreak-in-san-diego-county-11-12-2021/,2021-11-12T15:27:20-08:00,"
The County of San Diego has announced four new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 35 confirmed and three probable cases among people experiencing homelessness.
The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between Aug. 16 and Nov. 8, 2021, with the four new cases occurring between Oct. 28 and Nov. 8, 2021. The 38 cases in this outbreak represent 11% of the 333 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.
The cases are all among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego. No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.
The County is working closely with the City of San Diego to:

Prevent any future potential exposure sites.
Promote good hygienic precautions among homeless service providers and food providers.
Connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.

Other steps have included:

Relocation of 32 currently deployed handwashing stations to areas frequented by homeless individuals.
Placement of 16 new handwashing stations, with the most recent station placed in the Sports Arena area. Evaluation of additional need is ongoing.
Increased cleaning of portable and permanent public bathrooms.
Evaluated potential placements of new portable restrooms and have determined feasible sites in Downtown, Pacific Beach and Rolando Village.
Increased sidewalk sanitization from twice weekly to seven days per week for the time being. Frequency will be continually assessed.
Notification by the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality about the outbreak – and precautions – to food facilities in the downtown, Mission Valley and Hillcrest areas, charitable feeding operators, the California Restaurant Association, Downtown San Diego Partnership, Regional Task Force on Homelessness and Gaslamp Quarter Association.
Public health nurses conducting outreach at shelters.
Homeless Outreach Teams offering shelter resources and distributing weekly 1,000 hygiene kits with shigella information to persons experiencing homelessness.
Creation of County Public Health shigella website with outbreak information.

Shigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.
Typical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.  People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.
Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.
More information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

796,New Study States Regional Collaboration Key to Decarbonization,"Reducing carbon emissions to zero regionally can be done, according to a new academic report commissioned by the County.  The reductions will require local governments and agencies to work together, and the County of San Diego is positioned to coordinate that effort, the report states.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-study-states-regional-collaboration-key-to-decarbonization/,2021-11-15T13:17:17-08:00,"
Reducing carbon emissions to zero regionally can be done, according to a new academic report commissioned by the County.  The reductions will require local governments and agencies to work together, and the County of San Diego is positioned to coordinate that effort, the report states.
County Supervisors have scheduled a public hearing Wednesday, Nov. 17 to discuss the draft “San Diego Regional Decarbonization Framework” report’s findings as it nears its first phase of completion in February.
The Board commissioned the report in January when it voted to pursue leading an effort to move the entire region — not just the unincorporated county within its jurisdiction — toward net zero-carbon emissions. Project representatives said this county-led approach is the first of its kind in the nation.
The effort would require working with the region’s 18 cities and agencies like the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG).
The data-driven report is being developed by the UC San Diego School of Global Policy and Strategy and other energy, transportation and building systems experts. A supplemental study about the impact decarbonization would have on jobs, another by the University of San Diego Energy Policy Initiatives Center looking at climate action policies and social equity across the region, and the inclusion of additional stakeholder input will complete a fully integrated report in August 2022.
The UC San Diego report proposes strategies to reduce regional carbon emissions to net-zero levels no later than 2045, the carbon neutrality goal California set in 2018. The report states that it intends to inform regional, county and city policy making. And that it is separate from but complements ongoing climate action planning efforts by local governments — such as the County’s work to create a new Climate Action Plan — and agencies involved with regional energy, transportation and land-use planning.
It also says local governments have become the de facto leaders in the race to reduce greenhouse gases “in the absence of meaningful international action” because local governments are “on the front lines of both climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts.”
The report says the County of San Diego is in the right position to help lead local efforts in the region for several reasons.
The County has direct influence over greenhouse gas reduction in several areas, such as through its land-use development authority in unincorporated areas. It also has indirect influence as a regional governing body with elected officials representing all parts of the county. It has a role in developing and acquiring electricity as a member of San Diego Community Power. And it’s a voting member of several agencies and boards with authority over transit, water and air quality. That includes SANDAG, the San Diego Air Pollution Control District, the Metropolitan Transit District and North County Transit District, and the San Diego Regional Airport Authority.
The report proposes targeting four major contributors of greenhouse gases to reach net-zero emissions: electricity, transportation, buildings and land use.
Decarbonizing Electricity:
Dramatically increasing the amount of renewable energy county residents use. That would require transitioning away from natural gas-powered electricity plants, siting more solar and wind electricity plants, and potentially upgrading transmission lines.
Decarbonizing Transportation:
Finding ways to get more people into electric vehicles — something the report noted the County has jump-started with its Electric Vehicle Roadmap that will build charging stations and encourage people to buy electric vehicles. The report says the region also needs to decrease the miles people travel and increase the use of mass transit.
Decarbonizing Buildings: 
The report says it will be critical to decarbonize buildings, not just new buildings but existing buildings. Heating and cooling buildings here accounted for 9% of all carbon dioxide emissions in 2014 — about 300,000 metric tons. The report proposes switching from using natural gas to heat water and spaces to electricity, and away from using furnaces and air conditioners to electric heat pumps.
Using the Natural Environment and Land Uses to Remove Carbon Dioxide from the Air:
Animals breathe in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide. But plants, trees, wetlands, grasslands and agriculture extract CO2 from the air and use it to grow through photosynthesis. The report said “the simplest, most effective, least expensive solution is to continue to protect and preserve natural and working lands,” such as the County has done through its Multiple Species Conservation Program and Purchase of Agricultural Lands Easement Program.
Because it is a draft report, the authors state that its analyses and implications could change before it’s finalized in February.
Some of the draft report’s findings include:

While some sources of carbon emissions in the region can be ascribed to a specific geographic area, such as methane from solid waste landfills, the three largest sources of emissions in San Diego, light-duty vehicles (37%), electricity (23%), and natural gas in buildings (8%) cut across municipal boundaries.
Reduction of GHG emissions across the region is a collective action problem that requires joint action by many actors that, in the absence of incentives, would choose not to contribute.
Many policies necessary for reaching net-zero emissions are controlled at the state or federal level and not by local governments. The San Diego region can be a vocal advocate for these policies, such as federal tax incentives.
San Diego County has sufficient solar and wind resource potential to transition electricity to 100% of the estimated demand with renewable resources inside the County.
Neighboring Imperial County has significant solar and geothermal beyond internal population demands.
The California Independent System Operator estimates necessary transmission network upgrades for San Diego-Imperial-Baja-Arizona to be $3.9 billion and will take decades to complete.

The County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) has received a state grant to educate parents and caregivers on how to properly secure children in a safety seat.
The $249,999 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) will pay for a variety of community outreach events, education classes and training on the installation and use of child safety seats.
The car seat safety program includes:

Child safety seat inspection events and education classes.
Child safety seats at no-cost to low-income families following education classes.
Child Passenger Safety Technician (CPST) training, CPST certification courses.
Work with community partners to promote child passenger safety education.
Collaborate with law enforcement to increase occupant protection awareness.
Partnering with local organizations on car seat safety community outreach efforts in underserved communities.

The program runs through September 2022.
“Helping families, caregivers and education professionals to keep children safe is critical,” said Barbara Jiménez Barbara Jiménez, chief operations officer for HHSA’s Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities. “Protecting San Diego children is one of our top priorities, and properly secured car seats are are the best way to prevent harm to them in the event of a crash.”
“Like seat belts for teens and adults, correctly installed car seats are the best protection for children while they are traveling,” OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. “Car seat programs are an important traffic safety ally.”
This safety campaign aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

799,County Awarded Grant for Bicycle and Pedestrian Safety Program,"The County Health & Human Services Agency, Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities has received a $125,000 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety to improve the safety of bicyclists, pedestrians and scooter riders.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-awarded-grant-for-bicycle-and-pedestrian-safety-program/,2021-11-15T15:52:00-08:00,"
The County Health & Human Services Agency, Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities has received a $125,000 grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) to improve the safety of bicyclists, pedestrians and scooter riders.
“Our roads are increasingly riskier for people who walk or ride their bike,” OTS Director Barbara Rooney said. “The goal of this funding is to reverse the growing trend of bicyclist and pedestrian-involved crashes by educating the public on safe road behaviors.”
Grant funds will pay for a comprehensive safety program that will teach valuable skills for all types of road users. They include:

Education and outreach social media campaign to engage an expanded audience on safety and active transportation topics.
Participation in State and National campaigns, such as National Walk to School Day and California’s Pedestrian Safety Month.
Community, senior center, and school education presentations on safest bike/walking practices, with a focus on the benefits active transportation provides on health, community, and climate change.
Walking Field Trips that educate youth and older adults on safe walking habits.
Participation in “Open Streets” events promoting alternate transportation options.
Bicycle and scooter skills and training courses that educate on safe riding behaviors.
Presentations at stakeholder meetings focused on active transportation to share best practices and increase collaboration.

The services, which will run through Sept. 30, 2022, will be provided by Circulate San Diego.
This safety campaign aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.
Funding for this program was provided by a grant from the California Office of Traffic Safety, through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

800,Homeless Outreach Teams to Serve North County Region,The County is expanding homeless outreach services by forming a North Region team to address the needs of people experiencing homelessness in North San Diego County.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/homeless-outreach-teams-to-serve-north-county-region/,2021-11-15T17:09:12-08:00,"
The County is expanding homeless outreach services by forming a North Region team to address the needs of people experiencing homelessness in North San Diego County.
This is part of the County’s newly adopted Framework to End Homelessness. Under the new approach, the County will focus on creating a person-centered system, one that uses a housing-first approach, maximizes social services interactions and follows evidence-based and data-driven solutions. This will be done to increase affordable and appropriate housing and to ensure homeless prevention and response is done with racial and social equity.
Supervisor Tara Lawson-Remer, who coauthored a Board Letter for the new outreach program with Supervisor Jim Desmond, said Monday, “Homelessness is particularly challenging in North County. We have eight cities, and each city has a different plan, different staff and different resources. But starting today, for the first time, we are coordinating outreach across city and county lines so we can get people help and housing faster than ever before. It’s one united, collaborative effort to help the 1,500 people in North County without a home.”
Outreach teams each have a social worker, a street case manager and an outreach human services specialist who work in partnership with cities and service providers to better connect unhoused people with critical services and support including housing opportunities.
“This program is the first of its kind in the county and it will do better I believe, to help save lives and keep people off the streets and into the help and programs that they need,” said Supervisor Jim Desmond. “By partnering with the cities and the County of San Diego, this program is going to help triage those who are in desperate need of services that can be accessed by County social workers. They’ll be able to help transport clients, they’ll be able to access funds from the County to provide for incidentals such as clothing, food, help obtaining identification, and short-term motel/hotel vouchers.”
Lawson-Remer pointed out that the teams will be working in the streets, canyons and alleys to build trust with the people they hope to help.
A team will be stationed in Escondido, with another team will launch in Oceanside in January.
Escondido Mayor Paul McNamara, Oceanside Deputy Mayor Ryan Keim and Greg Angela with Interfaith Community Services also spoke in support of the new partnership.
The framework encompasses the County’s ongoing work and provides a vision to support forward, collaborative and impactful progress. The framework supports the County’s Live Well San Diego vision of healthy, safe and thriving residents. It will provide enhanced funding along with innovative new programming to guide existing and future regional efforts to address homelessness.

801,Flu Cases Outpace Last Season’s Cases,"Flu cases continue to outpace numbers of influenza cases compared to last season, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-cases-outpace-last-seasons-cases/,2021-11-17T16:51:03-08:00,"
Flu cases continue to outpace last season’s numbers, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.
To date, 315 flu cases have been reported locally this year, compared to 25 at the same time last season. In the last week, 28 cases were reported, compared to seven in the same week last year.
Flu vaccination status is especially important around the holidays when people stay indoors and gather in large groups, increasing the risk of getting sick.
“Get vaccinated now to avoid getting sick later and spreading the flu virus to others,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Especially the elderly, young children, pregnant women, those with chronic diseases, and people with compromised immune systems should get vaccinated as they are at a higher risk of developing complications from the flu.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Nov. 13, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 28 (compared to 30 the previous week).
Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (compared to 0 at this time last season).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 315 (compared to 25 last season).

Your Best Shot Against the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and the influenza vaccine does not protect against COVID-19.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control;
Pregnant women;
People aged 65 years and older; and
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk.

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

The County of San Diego supports the California Department of Public Health recommendation for a COVID-19 booster dose for anyone 18 and older who wants one and meets the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for time between doses.
People who completed the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine series more than six months ago are eligible for a booster shot at this time. Those who received the Johnson & Johnson one-dose vaccine more than two months ago are also eligible to get a booster shot.
Boosters are safe and effective and increase people’s immunity to the COVID-19 virus. Close to 345,000 San Diegans 18 years of age or older have received a booster dose.
“I encourage everyone who is eligible for a booster to make time soon to get their shot,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “As we begin to attend more gatherings for the holidays, the booster dose can help better prevent infection and slow the spread of COVID-19.”
No-cost boosters vaccines are widely available throughout the region, including at medical providers’ offices, pharmacies, health clinics, and County vaccination locations. For more information on boosters and vaccination locations, visit coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine. Vaccination appointments can be scheduled at myturn.ca.gov.

805,Update: Shigella Outbreak in San Diego County — 11-19-2021,"The County of San Diego has announced three new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 38 confirmed and three probable cases among people experiencing homelessness.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/update-shigella-outbreak-in-san-diego-county-11-19-2021/,2021-11-19T16:10:18-08:00,"
The County of San Diego has announced three new shigella cases associated with an ongoing outbreak, bringing the total to 38 confirmed and three probable cases among people experiencing homelessness.
The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between Aug. 16 and Nov. 8, 2021, with the four new cases occurring between Oct. 23 and Nov. 8, 2021. The 41 cases in this outbreak represent 11% of the 349 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.
The cases are primarily among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego. A case with a known address outside the City of San Diego is being investigated to determine where that individual was residing when they contracted the disease. No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.
The County is working closely with the City of San Diego to:

Prevent any future potential exposure sites.
Promote good hygienic precautions among homeless service providers and food providers.
Connect ill individuals to treatment and housing.

Other steps have included:

Relocation of 32 currently deployed handwashing stations and placement of 16 new handwashing stations to areas frequented by homeless individuals. Evaluation of additional need is ongoing.
Increased cleaning of portable and permanent public bathrooms.
Placement of 8 new portable restrooms by the City at three locations in in Downtown, Pacific Beach and Rolando Village. Other sites continue to be evaluated.
Increased sidewalk sanitization from twice weekly to seven days per week for the time being. Frequency will be continually assessed.
Launch of new “sidewalk reset” pilot program by City that allows for a deeper cleaning of sidewalks to remove build up and make regular sanitization efforts more effective. The process is being implemented in several areas including Downtown, Beach Areas and South Bay, with others being evaluated.
Notification by the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality about the outbreak – and precautions – to food facilities in the downtown, Mission Valley and Hillcrest areas, charitable feeding operators, the California Restaurant Association, Downtown San Diego Partnership, Regional Task Force on Homelessness and Gaslamp Quarter Association.
Public health nurses conducting outreach at shelters.
Homeless Outreach Teams offering shelter resources and distributing weekly 1,000 hygiene kits with shigella information to persons experiencing homelessness.
Creation of County Public Health shigella website with outbreak information.

Shigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.
Typical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.  People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.
Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.
More information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The next regularly scheduled shigella outbreak news release will appear Friday, Dec. 3. Updated information will remain available on the County Public Health shigella website.

806,Are You a Safe Thanksgiving Chef? Take the Quiz!,"We’re still rightfully being vigilant about COVID-19, but Thanksgiving is here again — so if you're cooking, cook safely!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/are-you-a-safe-thanksgiving-chef-take-the-quiz/,2021-11-22T09:58:26-08:00,"
We’re still rightfully being vigilant about COVID-19, but Thanksgiving is here again — so if you’re cooking, remember to cook safely!
Smart cooks know you always want to avoid simple mistakes that can let bacteria like E. coli, listeria and salmonella turn your feast into heaping helpings of food-borne illness for your family and friends.
So remember to use safe-cooking rules like, “keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold; keep meats and veggies separated during food prep; and practice good hygiene.”
To help you all be safe and thankful, the County’s Department of Environmental Health and Quality is offering it’s annual — and we hope fun — safe-Thanksgiving cooking quiz to help you prepare!
Here you go!
What’s the best way to thaw frozen meat? 

Put it out on the counter, don’t let anyone touch it and wait till the outside is mushy.
Run hot water over it — until the outside is mushy.
Let it sit in a pot of water until the outside gets (you guessed it…) mushy!
Let it defrost in the fridge. Meats, poultry and fish should be defrosted in the refrigerator. (If it’s a big turkey, for at least 24 hours for every five pounds in weight.)

Answer: D, of course. Using the refrigerator to thaw slowly and evenly is the best, safest way to defrost any meat. Because bacteria can grow exponentially at room temperatures.  Note: The United States Department of Agriculture says that you can also thaw meats in cold water. But — and this is important — the water must be cold, under 40 degrees, and should be changed every 30 minutes to keep it cold. Thawing in the fridge is easier!
How often should you wash your hands and cutting boards when preparing food?

You don’t have to wash your hands and cutting boards. Just wipe them off on your shirt or pants.
Before you start cooking.
After you pet the dog. The cat. The gerbil. Or pick up the kids.
If you sneeze, blow your nose or have to run to the restroom.
The answer is everything except answer A, but mainly, “OFTEN!”

Answer: Definitely E. (PLEASE tell me you did NOT answer “A.”) You should wash your hands and cutting boards before and after everything in B, C and D. Handwashing is always a key part of safe cooking. And let’s face it, as we continue to fight COVID-19, it’s important to wash your hands even if you’re not cooking! So break out that soap and do it. Harmful bacteria, from E. coli to salmonella and staphylococcus aureus, as well as viruses, can be removed from people’s hands through proper handwashing.
Here are just a few other things you should wash your hands after doing: coughing, blowing your nose, using the restroom handling money, eating, drinking, smoking and handling or preparing raw food.
Should you rinse off fruits and vegetables?

Nah. If they look clean they’re good.
Why? The supermarket washes them, right?
No way! Fruits and vegetables are always better when they’re a little crunchy.
Yes. You should rinse fruits and vegetables with cold water to remove lingering dirt that can carry bacteria.

Answer: Absolutely D. Rinsing with cold water cleans off dirt and other contaminants. But don’t wash them with detergents or soap, even dishwashing soap. You could end up eating residues from those cleaners if they’re absorbed by fruits and vegetables.
Why should you keep raw meats and meat products separated from fruits and vegetables when cutting them up or preparing them?

You know, meats and fruits and vegetables just don’t like each other. Last thing you need on Thanksgiving is a food fight.
Veggies can make your meat taste weird. Just. Weird.
Because raw meats, meat products and blood can carry bacteria like E. coli and salmonella that can contaminate fruits and vegetables — and make people sick.
You do not have to. Juice from meats is called “marinade.”

Answer: The correct answer is C. (If you said D — you should seriously think about staying out of the kitchen.) Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness, according to the USDA. That is, the transfer of harmful bacteria from one food, particularly raw meats, poultry and shellfish to other foods. When preparing food, you need to keep raw meats and their juices away from fruits and vegetables and all ready-to-eat foods.
If you can, use separate cutting boards for meats and produce. If you can’t use separate cutting boards, wash yours with hot, soapy water after using them on raw meats and before using them to cut fruits and vegetables!
What is the Danger Zone? And what does it have to do with Thanksgiving dinner?

All you people from the 1980s, stand up! It’s from Top Gun! Tom Cruise, Kenny Loggins!  “Highway to the DANGER ZONE! Riiiide into the DANGER ZONE!” 
It’s that toy-strewn, carpet-rippled, child-filled distance you must navigate to get the Thanksgiving food from your kitchen to the table, without dropping everything!
It’s the range of temperatures between 40 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit — the temperatures where bacteria can grow like crazy in foods, doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes.

Answer: The correct answer is C. We love Top Gun too. But the real “Danger Zone” is the range of temperature between 40 degrees and 140 degrees Fahrenheit that allows bacteria to breed exponentially — not a good thing. If hot foods cool or cold foods heat up enough to enter that zone, your food can become a bacteria-fest. And you can end up getting sick. So keep hot foods safely heated with chafing dishes, preheated steam tables, warming trays, slow cookers and ovens. Place cold foods in containers on ice, or in the fridge. And refrigerate leftovers as soon as you can, but definitely within two hours.
And finally, we end with an age-old bonus question:
Is the “five-second rule” real? Can you eat something you’ve dropped on the floor if you pick it up in less than five seconds?

Of course it’s real. Just pick it up quick and blow on it. Nothing can contaminate your food in less than five seconds. My dogs eat everything off the floor and I’ve never seen them get sick.
No, no no. It’s not real. You really shouldn’t eat anything you’ve dropped on floor.

Answer: B. It’s OK for the dog to eat food that’s fallen to the ground but it’s not safe for people. Truth is, almost any contact is long enough for food to be contaminated by bacteria that can be found on the ground or in your house. According to research conducted by Rutgers University, bacteria can transfer from a surface to food in less than a second!
So there you have it. Now you’re an expert. But if you’re still interested, you can get more information about food safety tips at FoodSafety.gov’s “Food Safety by Types of Food” webpage, or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry hotline at 1-888-674-6854.
Be safe. Cook safe. And have a great Thanksgiving!

808,San Diegans Urged to Get Vaccinated Against Influenza,"Influenza cases in the San Diego region have been steadily increasing, prompting County health officials to encourage residents to continue getting vaccinated.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-get-vaccinated-against-influenza/,2021-11-24T10:30:41-08:00,"
Influenza cases in the San Diego region have been steadily increasing, prompting County health officials to encourage residents to continue getting vaccinated.
This season’s total now stands at 353 cases after 42 additional infections were reported the week ending Nov. 20. The total far exceeds the number of cases that had been reported at the same time last year—28 cases—and surpasses the prior five-year average of 327 cases at this point.
“This holiday season, share the joy, not the germs,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The flu vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and those around you. Get vaccinated now.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Nov. 20, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared to 3% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 42 (compared to 25 the previous week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (compared to 0 at this time last season)

Your Best Shot Against the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

810,"Be Alert, Stay Prepared During Red Flag Conditions","Residents are being asked to be alert for wildfires as the National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning from Wednesday night through Friday evening, with the potential for strong gusty winds and low humidity.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/be-alert-stay-prepared-during-red-flag-conditions/,2021-11-24T12:52:26-08:00,"
Residents are being asked to be alert for wildfires as the National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning from Wednesday night through Friday evening, with the potential for strong gusty winds and low humidity.
The alert has been issued for San Diego County’s inland valleys and mountains. However, all residents should be alert because if any fires ignite under red flag conditions they could spread rapidly.
For example, residents should refrain from using power tools — including lawn mowers — outside during high-fire conditions because they can potentially spark on rocks and ignite grass or brush fires.
If you do choose to cut away and remove dead and dying plants near your homes or structures, use hand tools only.
Residents are always encouraged to maintain defensible fire-space around their homes and to remove dead leaves, debris and other flammable items such as wood piles that may be stacked against structures. Those kinds of things can be ignited by embers from wildfires.
Here are some other guidelines to follow:

Be particularly careful with smoking materials to avoid accidentally starting a fire.
Never pull your vehicle over in grass as it can ignite a grass fire. Make sure your vehicle is well maintained as faulty catalytic converters have been a major cause of accidental fires in San Diego County.
If you have a trailer on your vehicle, make sure the chains don’t drag on the ground while driving and spark a fire.

An important factor in being prepared is to stay informed in the events of a regional emergency.
Here are some ways to be informed:

Residents can download the County’s SD Emergency app in English or Spanish from the Google Play store or the Apple App Store. The app provides news updates, maps, shelter locations and includes disaster planning templates and interactive checklists. If a regional emergency, such as a wildfire, does occur, updates and other information will be posted at sdcountyemergency.com  and sent out via the app.
Register for AlertSanDiego  or at ListoSanDiego, the County’s cell phone notification service. By doing that, you will receive any emergency messages such as evacuation warnings that apply to your neighborhood on your cell phone.
Don’t wait until an emergency, when you’re already stressed to figure out what you need to do in the event of an evacuation. Complete a family disaster plan template from the app or from ReadySanDiego.org to help your family plan for an emergency including where to meet if you are separated and cannot return home.
You can also stay in touch with official emergency information by following CAL FIRE on Twitter in the event of a fire. More weather forecast information and updates are available at the National Weather Service.

814,How to Protect Yourself from COVID-19 Omicron Variant,"While the state’s first COVID-19 case caused by the Omicron variant has been detected in Northern California in a traveler from South Africa, San Diego County health officials are urging people to continue following existing guidance.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/how-to-protect-yourself-from-covid-19-omicron-variant/,2021-12-01T15:40:04-08:00,"
While the state’s first COVID-19 case caused by the Omicron variant has been detected in Northern California in a traveler from South Africa, San Diego County health officials are urging people to continue following existing guidance.
The recommended preventive measures against COVID-19 and its previous variants, they say, are the best bet to protect against the new strain.
“There’s a lot about Omicron we don’t know yet, such as how it spreads, how sick it can make people and how well existing vaccines work against it,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “In the meantime, the same precautions we’ve been advising for other strains of COVID-19 should help prevent or lessen the likelihood of people getting and spreading the Omicron variant, as well as the Delta, which is still the dominant strain.”
Although no cases of the Omicron variant have been detected in the San Diego region, the County and the local medical community are regularly monitoring for the Omicron variant using genome sequencing.
The County is also working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health to review recommendations when the variant arrives in the region.
Health officials recommend the following measures to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant:

Get vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is available at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the My Turn website.
Wear a mask, especially in public indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status.
Get tested if you have any symptoms, whether you’ve been vaccinated or not. You can make a free test appointment or find a walk-in test clinic at coronavirus-sd.com.
Wash your hands frequently and stay home if you’re sick and distance yourself from others.

Five were age 80 or older, five were in their 70s, six were in their 60s, three were in their 50s and two were in their 40s.
Two of the people who died were fully vaccinated and 19 were not fully vaccinated.
16 had underlying medical conditions, four did not and one had medical history pending.

815,County COVID-19 Cases Jump After Thanksgiving Gatherings,"A high number of COVID-19 cases for the San Diego region was reported Dec. 2, an increase local health officials believe is the result of Thanksgiving gatherings.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-covid-19-cases-jump-after-thanksgiving-gatherings/,2021-12-03T14:48:15-08:00,"
A high number of COVID-19 cases for the San Diego region was reported Dec. 2, an increase local health officials believe is the result of Thanksgiving gatherings.
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 1,153 COVID-19 cases, up from case numbers in the 600s on the prior two days.
County health officials believe the upturn is tied to Thanksgiving gatherings and not due to the new Omicron variant, which has not yet been identified in San Diego County. The last time more than 1,150 cases were reported was Sept. 10 when 1,188 cases were identified.
“Unfortunately, rises like these after holidays are not unexpected,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “We are vigilant for any changes in cases that Omicron might cause, but we’ve seen similar spikes like this in the past.”
Kaiser says more case increases are likely to occur during the next couple months because of other upcoming holidays.
“County residents need to be mindful that Delta is still out there,” Kaiser said. “Indoor masking, vaccination and good hygiene are still strongly advised. People should not visit family and friends or go to work if you’re ill.”
With recent detections of the Omicron variant in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the County continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health to review existing recommendations as more data becomes available.
County health officials urge San Diegans to continue following the measures to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant. They are:

Get vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is available at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the My Turn website.

The County of San Diego has announced the ongoing outbreak of shigella now stands at 41 confirmed and seven probable cases, an increase from 38 confirmed and three probable cases in the Nov. 19 update.
The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between Aug. 16 and Nov. 21, 2021, with the three new cases occurring between Nov. 23 and Nov. 30, 2021, with symptom onset for the latest case being Nov. 21, 2021. The 48 cases in this outbreak represent 13% of the 372 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.
The County Public Health shigella website has been updated to include an epidemiological curve showing declining case numbers in recent weeks.
The County has been working with the Infectious Disease branch of the California Department of Public Health and determined that we are reaching levels of transmission that are typical for this disease.
The cases are among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego and two cases in North County.
No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.
The County continues to work closely with the City of San Diego, regional homeless service providers and others to identify new cases, prevent future potential exposures and promote good hygienic and sanitation precautions.
Shigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.
Typical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.  People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.
Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.
More information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification, the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The next regularly scheduled shigella outbreak news release will appear Friday, Dec. 17.

Check out the latest County library in Encinitas. It comes in the form of a self-serve kiosk about the size of a bus shelter and holds hundreds of the latest books, DVDs and audiobooks.
The kiosk opened to customers after a ribbon-cutting ceremony on Monday.
“Today is about bringing books closer to where people live — and doing it on a scale that is fast, efficient, and can be replicated throughout the County,” said Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer. “With this 24/7 library kiosk, a whole new neighborhood can enjoy the benefits of a library just a few steps away from their home.”
“The kiosk operates like a vending machine,” said County Library Director Migell Acosta. “You can check out and return books and DVDs, download audio and eBooks, and browse the entire library catalog 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.”
The 24/7 kiosk measures 8 feet tall, 13 feet wide and 5 feet deep yet it offers the full circulation functionality of a library. The structure is ADA accessible and offers Wi-Fi capability, too.
The County Library worked with the San Diego County Credit Union to bring the kiosk to the area. Customers can find it outside the credit union branch at 501 N. El Camino Real.
The County now offers five kiosks throughout the region. The four other kiosks are in Kearny Mesa, Bonsall, Boulevard and Chula Vista.
They were closed due to the COVID pandemic but reopened Monday as part of the ribbon-cutting celebration for the new kiosk in Encinitas.

819,Registrar Holding Meetings for Input on County’s Election Administration Plan,The Registrar of Voters office is holding a series of consultation meetings inviting the public to have a say in creating the County’s new Election Administration Plan.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/registrar-holding-meetings-for-input-on-countys-election-administration-plan/,2021-12-08T14:53:08-08:00,"
The Registrar of Voters office is holding a series of consultation meetings inviting the public to have a say in creating the County’s new Election Administration Plan.
The meetings begin Thursday and continue through January. The plan describes how the Registrar’s office will administer elections under the Voter’s Choice Act. The public can give input on where to locate vote centers and ballot drop boxes. Attendees can also give feedback on voter education and outreach plans.
The Registrar’s office is creating the plan because the Board of Supervisors approved the transition to the vote center model on Oct. 19.
The vote center model falls under the Voter’s Choice Act, and it modernizes the election process in several ways.
Active registered voters automatically receive a ballot in the mail. In-person voting moves from traditional polling places to vote centers. And voters have the option to return their ballot by mail, a secure ballot drop box, or vote in person at any vote center. All the vote centers are open for four days and some up to 11 days, giving voters more time to return their ballot for Election Day.
The concept isn’t entirely new to local voters. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Registrar of Voters used a similar voting model for the November 2020 presidential general and September 2021 gubernatorial recall elections.
The new Election Administration Plan must be in place for the June 2022 gubernatorial primary. By law, the Registrar must hold consultation meetings beforehand with the county’s disability, and state and federally covered language communities.
The communities include Arabic, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Laotian, Native American, Spanish and Vietnamese. Anyone is invited to attend. Check the Registrar’s calendar to see if they are in person, virtual or both.
Suggestion forms for vote center and mail ballot drop-off locations are also available online.
Important dates include:

Jan. 13:

The draft Election Administration Plan will be posted on the Registrar’s website for a 14-day public review and comment.


Jan 24:

5:30-7:30 p.m. virtual consultation meeting targeting the county’s disability, and state and federally covered language communities.


Jan 28:

5:30-7:30 p.m. in-person and virtual public hearing targeting the county’s disability, and state and federally covered language communities.


Feb. 21:

The amended Election Administration Plan will be posted on the Registrar’s website for a second 14-day public review and comment period.


March 6:

Public comment period ends.


March 8:

The Registrar posts the final adopted plan and sends it to the California Secretary of State for approval.



The Election Administrative Plan will be reviewed in the odd years prior to each scheduled election year. The next process will begin in 2023 for the 2024 election cycles. For more information about the Voter’s Choice Act, visit sdvote.com.

820,Board Approves New Master Plan for McClellan Palomar Airport Master,County Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to adopt a new 20-year master plan for McClellan-Palomar Airport designed to make the airport safer and quieter and which could entice small commercial air service back to the airport.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-approves-new-master-plan-for-mcclellan-palomar-airport-master/,2021-12-08T16:15:34-08:00,"
County Supervisors voted unanimously Wednesday to adopt a new 20-year master plan for McClellan-Palomar Airport designed to make the airport safer and quieter and which could potentially entice small commercial air service back to the airport.
The Board also approved the master plan’s environmental studies and directed County staff to create an Airport System Sustainability Plan for all eight County airports. That plan would make County airports meet overall carbon reduction regulations in both the Climate Action Plan that the County is working on and the County’s proposed Regional Decarbonization Framework.
Supervisors said they were excited about the possibility of McClellan-Palomar becoming a leader in the air industry’s future transition to electric and alternative fuel aircraft. County staff said United Airlines recently ordered a fleet of 19-seat electric aircraft that could be flying by 2030 that would eliminate carbon emissions and reduce noise by nearly 70%.
The new master plan will not expand the airport’s existing boundaries or serve large commercial aircraft. However, it will add 200 feet to the east end of its runway, which will improve safety and reduce noise. Safety improvements will also add an arresting system to the west end of the runway designed to help stop aircraft in emergencies.
The 200-foot runway extension will make the airport safer by giving aircraft more room to land and take off. And County officials said it would decrease noise by giving aircraft more room to accelerate and fly higher, faster, which would help to minimize noise over nearby neighborhoods. Addressing the noise issue, supervisors also voted to lobby the Federal Aviation Administration to relax its “quiet hours” moratorium and allow the County to establish non-flying hours at the airport.
County officials said the runway extension could also improve McClellan-Palomar’s prospects to lure back regional commercial air service, using smaller aircraft carrying 30 to 70 passengers.
The County worked extensively with the public and local jurisdictions including the City of Carlsbad as it created the master plan, including holding several public workshops, creating an informational website and conducting surveys.
The County met with Carlsbad staff more than a dozen times and met quarterly with Carlsbad and the cities of Oceanside, San Marcos and Vista. The Palomar Airport Advisory Committee unanimously voted to recommend approval of the master plan and environmental studies in October.
The master plan improvements are expected to increase McClellan-Palomar’s already large economic impact. The airport currently provides more than 2,500 jobs, over $460 million in local economic activity and generates more than $72 million in tax revenue.
The master plan will make McClellan-Palomar Airport eligible for FAA funding, which traditionally covers up to 90% of capital for safety improvements.
The estimated cost of the master plan’s safety improvements is roughly $42 million.

An Omicron COVID-19 case has been identified in San Diego, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The new variant was identified in a San Diego resident who had recently traveled abroad.
The specimen tested positive for COVID-19 Dec. 8. The San Diego Epidemiology and Research for COVID Health (SEARCH) Alliance conducted whole genome sequencing and identified the Omicron variant Thursday morning.
The patient, who had been vaccinated and received a booster, was not hospitalized and is under isolation.
The County is conducting its investigation to identify people who may have had close contact with the patient.
“We expected that the Omicron variant would make its way to San Diego, and it has,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We are continuing to monitor for the Omicron variant and will report any other cases to the public when they are identified.”
The County continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health to review existing recommendations and determine if changes should be made in the region.
Dr. Wooten recommends the following measures to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant:

Get vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is available at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the My Turn website.
Wear a mask, especially in public indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status.
Get tested if you have any symptoms, whether you’ve been vaccinated or not. You can make a free test appointment or find a walk-in test clinic at coronavirus-sd.com.
Get CA Notify to receive alerts if you were in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19.
Wash your hands frequently and stay home if you’re sick and distance yourself from others.

824,"Rain Around the Corner; Get Free Sand Bags from County, CAL FIRE","With potentially heavy rains expected around the county early next week, the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are offering free sandbags to residents who live in the unincorporated areas.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/rain-around-the-corner-get-free-sand-bags-from-county-cal-fire/,2021-12-10T11:47:17-08:00,"
With potentially heavy rains expected around the county early next week, the County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are offering free sandbags to residents who live in the unincorporated areas.
The county has already seen some rain this week and weather forecasters are predicting potentially heavy rains starting Monday night lasting through Tuesday.
As they have in the past, the County and CAL FIRE are providing free bags and/or sand at numerous fire stations for people who live in the unincorporated areas.
Rain can cause flooding and erosion, particularly in areas that aren’t covered by plants, landscaping, grass and trees, and in areas that have burned — such as the areas that burned in the December 2020 Valley Fire near Alpine.
Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.
Sand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.
People should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags. Some stations may have a limited supply.

825,5 Ways to Prevent Winter Home Fires,"The winter holidays can be bright, wonderful, and cozy, but you need to be sure to take fire-safe measures.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/5-ways-to-prevent-winter-home-fires/,2021-12-10T14:13:13-08:00,"
The winter holidays can be bright, wonderful, and cozy, but you need to be sure to take fire-safe measures.  
Holiday decorations, including Christmas trees, were the cause of an average of 790 winter fires per year across the country between 2015 and 2019, according to the National Fire Protection Association. These fires caused an annual average of 1 civilian death, 26 civilian injuries, and $13 million in direct property damage.  
The San Diego County Fire Protection District offers the following safety guidance: 
1.) Keep your tree at least 3 feet from a furnace, fireplace or portable heater. 
Keep cut trees watered to prevent drying out quickly. A dry tree can burn in less than a minute. This video by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission illustrates how a dry tree can go up in flames in about 30 seconds.

After Christmas, put the tree out promptly for proper disposal or recycling to reduce the risk for fire. 
2.) Prevent electrical fires by ensuring you buy holiday lights that have been tested for safety by an independent laboratory. Check for a label.  

Follow directions for safety. Don’t hang indoor lights outside or vice versa.  
Don’t plug too many items into an electrical socket or extension cord.  
Don’t string together more than 3 strands of lights. 
Inspect your lights and don’t use damaged ones. If you do buy new lights, LED lights are more fire safe. 
Don’t connect LED lights and non-LED light strands.  
Unplug lights and your tree at night before leaving the house or going to bed.  
Try to buy and use flame resistant or flame retardant decorations especially when placed near lights or heat sources. 

3.) Have your chimney inspected at least once a year to check for its soundness as well as hazardous deposits or other blockages that could cause a chimney fire. 

Never use excessive paper or flammable liquid to start a fire. 
Use a metal or glass screen to keep embers in the fireplace opening.
Never leave a fire unattended or burning overnight. 

4.) Never put electric heaters near flammable items like curtains or fabrics, dry trees or garland, or decorations. 

Never plug into an extension cord or overloaded electrical outlet. 
If using or buying a portable heater, make sure it’s a good quality model that has been professionally tested for safety. 
Never leave it on overnight. 

5.) Candles should only be placed on sturdy surfaces away from curtains or fabrics or where pets or children can reach them. 

People should also use stable candleholders. 
Never leave lit candles unattended.

826,Locally Acquired Omicron Case Identified in San Diego County,"A man in his 30s is believed to have contracted the Omicron COVID-19 variant locally, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/locally-acquired-omicron-case-identified-in-san-diego-county/,2021-12-10T14:36:44-08:00,"
A man in his 30s is believed to have contracted the Omicron COVID-19 variant locally, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The patient tested positive for COVID-19 Dec. 8. The San Diego Epidemiology and Research for COVID Health Alliance conducted whole genome sequencing and determined it was the Omicron variant late in the evening Dec. 9. The latest case was first detected through the Expedited COVID Identification Environment lab at UC San Diego.
The San Diego County resident did not have a travel history, had mild symptoms which have resolved, and he did not need to be hospitalized. The man, who was fully vaccinated and had received his booster shot more than two weeks earlier, is currently at home in isolation.
Contact tracing is underway to identify people who may have had close contact with the patient.
“This case confirms our expectation that the Omicron variant is now spreading in the community. While the Delta variant remains the main strain circulating in San Diego, we expect to see more Omicron cases in the region,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diegans should continue taking the recommended precautions, especially getting all the recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses.”
To date, there have been two Omicron variant cases confirmed in San Diego County. The first local Omicron case was reported by the County Dec. 9 in a patient who traveled abroad.
Future Omicron cases will be tallied in the Summary of Variant Cases which is published by the County every Wednesday.
The County continues to work with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the California Department of Public Health to review existing recommendations and determine if changes should be made in the region.
Dr. Wooten recommends the following measures to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant:

Get vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is available at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the My Turn website.
Wear a mask, especially in public indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status.
Get tested if you’ve traveled or have any symptoms, whether you’ve been vaccinated or not. You can make a free test appointment or find a walk-in test clinic at coronavirus-sd.com.
Get CA Notify to receive alerts if you were in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19.
Wash your hands frequently and stay home if you’re sick and distance yourself from others.

The namesake of the County of San Diego Leon L. Williams Human Relations Commission was among six community leaders honored in its first-ever awards ceremony Friday.
Leon L. Williams received a lifetime achievement award for his efforts in fighting racism and inequality, and his political leadership in both the County and City of San Diego.
During the inaugural awards, County Board Chair Nathan Fletcher gave remarks and Senior Liaison Officer for the United Nations Refugee Agency Nathan Luke Williams gave the keynote address.
The virtual event was scheduled to coincide with International Human Rights Day.
The County Board of Supervisors re-established the Human Relations Commission in May 2020 and named it in Williams’ honor. The 99-year-old civic leader received the award during a private ceremony at his home. The presentation was featured in a video that played during the ceremony.

Five other community leaders were recognized for their contributions.
A Chair Leadership Award went to County Board Vice-Chair Nora Vargas. The district 1 supervisor was recognized as an example of a woman who takes control over negative situations, shows courage and stands up for what is right in all instances.
County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten won a Chair Leadership Award for her continuous work leading the region through the COVID-19 pandemic and saving lives in the process.
The Unsung Hero Award went to a Vietnamese immigrant who came to the United States in 1990. Jean-Huy Tran was honored for his work in the Asian Pacific Islander community and for his commitment to social justice initiatives, inclusion, equity and diversity.
A Youth Award was presented to Evan Johnson, a young nonbinary adult, for their work, courage and leadership serving the transgender and gender diverse youth community in San Diego.
A second Youth Award was given to Nedy Velasquez, a first-generation immigrant and DACA recipient, who was recognized for her work in advocating for her community. Among her achievements, Velasquez stepped up to gain COVID-19 health care for immigrants, non-English speaking residents and rural farmworkers in the North County where she lives.
The awards ceremony was streamed live. You can watch the ceremony in its entirety in the above video.

Starting Dec. 15, San Diegans will be required to wear a mask while indoors in all public places, regardless of their vaccination status, under a new statewide mandate issued Monday.
The California Department of Public Health (CDPH) announced the new requirements were a response to the increase in cases and hospitalizations in the state and the detection of the new Omicron variant. The County follows CDPH’s requirements. The indoor face covering mandate is scheduled to last at least through Jan. 15, 2022 and will be reevaluated.
“Masks help to slow the spread of COVID-19 and its many variants,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diegans should wear a mask while indoors in public places to protect themselves and others.”
The state COVID-19 public health updated procedures also include the following:

COVID-19 testing prior to attending mega events. A negative PCR test is required 48 hours before an event or an antigen test 24 hours before the event.
Asking travelers to the state to get a COVID-19 test three to five days after arrival.

In addition to wearing a mask indoors in public places, the following measures also help to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant:

Get vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is available at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the My Turn website.
Get tested if you’ve travelled or have any symptoms, whether you’ve been vaccinated or not. You can make a free test appointment or find a walk-in test clinic at coronavirus-sd.com.
Wash your hands frequently and stay home if you’re sick and distance yourself from others.

All the above strategies will help to keep you, your family and your communities safe. More information about COVID-19, variants, testing and vaccinations can be found at coronavirus-sd.com.

829,County Reminds People About Federal Internet Discount Program,The County is reminding the public about a Dec. 31 deadline for low-income residents and families to apply to receive discounted high-speed Internet service through the Federal Communications Commission.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reminds-people-about-federal-internet-discount-program/,2021-12-15T09:03:10-08:00,"
The County is reminding the public about a Dec. 31 deadline for low-income residents and families to apply to receive discounted high-speed Internet service through the Federal Communications Commission.
Eligible residents and families who apply by Dec. 31 can receive FCC high-speed Internet discounts through March 2022 through local providers — up to $50 a month for households and $75 a month on qualifying tribal lands.
The FCC created its Emergency Broadband Service discount program during the COVID-19 pandemic to help eligible residents and families get or stay connected to high-speed Internet service. The program is being replaced in March 2022 by a new FCC discount program.
For general information about the program and links to relevant websites, be sure to go to the FCC’s emergency broadband benefit website. FCC officials have warned the public that a fraudulent website falsely offered enrollment in the program to collect people’s information.
How to Apply
Enrollment is a two-step process.

First, go to GetEmergencyBroadband.org to print out a mail-in application or submit an application online.
Contact your preferred participating provider to select an eligible plan and have the discount applied to your bill.

Note: Eligible households MUST apply for the program and contact a participating provider to select a high-speed Internet program. 
Who Is Eligible?
A household is eligible if a member of the household meets one of the following:

Has an income at or below 135% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, or who participates in certain assistance programs, such as SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), Medicaid, or Lifeline, the FCC’s Lifeline Support for Affordable Communications program
Is approved to receive benefits under the free and reduced-price school lunch program or the school breakfast program, including through the USDA Community Eligibility Provision in the 2019-2020, 2020-2021, or 2021-2022 school year
Received a Federal Pell Grant during the current award year
Experienced a substantial loss of income due to job loss or furlough since Feb. 29, 2020 and the household had a total income in 2020 at or below $99,000 for single filers and $198,000 for joint filers; or
Meets the eligibility criteria for a participating provider’s existing low-income or COVID-19 program.

Ensuring that all San Diegans have access to high-speed Internet is important to the County. The County is a member of the San Diego Association of Government’s (SANDAG) Regional Digital Divide task force and is working on a plan to develop wider high-speed Internet infrastructure throughout the unincorporated areas. County Supervisors also voted unanimously in May to commit up to $1.4 million to a SANDAG/Caltrans project to expand fiber optic cable along state route 67.
Here’s a list of frequently asked questions about the high-speed Internet discount program.

830,San Diegans Urged to Get Vaccinated as Influenza Spreads,"Influenza continued to sicken more San Diegans last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-get-vaccinated-as-influenza-spreads/,2021-12-15T11:11:31-08:00,"
Influenza continued to sicken more San Diegans last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
For the week ending Dec. 11, a total of 154 lab-confirmed flu cases were reported in the region, a 36% increase compared to the prior week when 113 influenza infections were identified.
“Influenza activity in the region remains low, but we’re starting to see more cases locally,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “An annual flu vaccine is the best way to prevent serious illness from influenza. The influenza vaccine is readily available throughout San Diego. Get vaccinated now before the flu spreads even more during the holidays and the winter months.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the Influenza Watch weekly report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Dec. 11, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 154 (compared to 113 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 678 (compared to 40 at the same time last season and 667 prior 5-year average during the same week)
Total influenza deaths to date: 0 (compared to 0 at this time last season)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is now available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

The County and the City of San Diego today opened a new, 44-bed shelter for people experiencing homelessness and who are struggling with substance use disorders or mental health issues or both.
The Community Harm Reduction Team shelter is in former retail store in the Midway community.
The County has committed initial funding for five years but would continue providing outreach to eligible clients and connect them with shelter, behavioral health services, case management, permanent housing and medical care for as long as it’s necessary. The goal is to get San Diegans who are homeless on a path to wellness, stability and finding a permanent place to live.
Outreach and case management, which includes Naloxone distribution to reverse narcotic overdoses, fentanyl testing and sterile syringe access, will be handled by Family Health Centers of San Diego through a contract with the County.
Family Health Centers of San Diego will provide substance use counselors, peer support, mental health clinicians and nurse practitioners for medical consultation.
Upon initial engagement by outreach workers, clients are welcomed to the new shelter with day-to-day operations provided by Alpha Project which is offering 24-hour staffing to support 44 beds.
The new shelter is part of the County’s regional effort to improve access to behavioral health services with its sites and in partnership with others. The County recently expanded mobile crisis response teams, crisis stabilization units and is working to maximize mental and substance use services throughout the region.

832,County Receives Independent Commission’s Final Redistricting Map,The County of San Diego received the new maps that will outline County supervisorial voting districts for the next decade Wednesday from the Independent Redistricting Commission.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-receives-independent-commissions-final-redistricting-map/,2021-12-15T15:57:23-08:00,"
The County of San Diego received the new maps that will outline County supervisorial voting districts for the next decade Wednesday from the Independent Redistricting Commission.
Redistricting — redrawing voting boundaries — is done every 10 years, using U.S. Census data to ensure that voting districts contain roughly the same number of people.
This was the first time that local boundaries were set by an independent commission. The 14-member commission capped off a year of work and 49 public meetings last week to meet its Dec. 15 deadline to submit the new boundaries to the County Clerk of the Board of Supervisors.
The new maps establish one County supervisorial district — District 1 currently represented by Supervisor Nora Vargas — as a majority Latino district, with 61.4% of the population and 58.2% of the voting age population identified as Latino. District 1 includes unincorporated areas and the cities of Imperial Beach, National City and Chula Vista.
District 2 and District 5 are the largest geographic districts, between them stretching from the coast in the west, to the Orange and Riverside county lines to the north, east to the Imperial County line and south to the U.S.-Mexico border.
District 2, currently represented by Supervisor Joel Anderson, is mainly an eastern district and includes unincorporated areas and the cities of El Cajon, Poway and Santee.
District 5, currently represented by Supervisor Jim Desmond, is mainly a northern district and includes unincorporated areas and the cities of Escondido, Oceanside, San Marcos and Vista.
District 3, currently represented by Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer, is mainly a coastal district stretching from Carlsbad to Coronado.
District 4, currently represented by Chair Nathan Fletcher, includes unincorporated areas around parts of the cities of San Diego, Lemon Grove and La Mesa.
The redistricting commission’s final maps and reports are available on the County of San Diego Redistricting webpage.

While the Delta strain of COVID-19 remains dominant in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting an additional four local cases of the Omicron variant, bringing the total to six.
The two previously reported cases were fully vaccinated and received their booster shots, while the four cases reported today were fully vaccinated but had not received booster shots.
Overall COVID-19 cases are also on the rise, with an additional 646 cases reported today.
“The holidays and colder temperatures mean San Diegans are spending more time indoors, where COVID-19 spreads more easily,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “I urge our community to continue taking the recommended precautions so that we can all have a safe and happy holiday season.”
In light of the increase in cases and hospitalizations, and the spread of the Omicron variant, the California Department of Public Health has implemented a new statewide mask mandate, which went into effect Wednesday.
The mandate requires that Californians age two and older wear a facial covering in all public indoor spaces. The indoor face covering mandate is scheduled to last at least through Jan. 15, 2022 and will be reevaluated.
In addition to wearing a mask indoors in public places, the following measures also help to protect against all varieties of COVID-19, including the Omicron variant:

Get vaccinated and get a booster if you qualify. The vaccine is widely available in the region, including at health care providers, retail pharmacies and community clinics. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the My Turn website.
Wear a mask, especially in public indoor settings, regardless of vaccination status.
Get tested if you’ve traveled or have any symptoms, whether you’ve been vaccinated or not. You can make a free test appointment or find a walk-up test clinic at coronavirus-sd.com.
Get CA Notify to receive alerts if you were in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19.
Wash your hands frequently and stay home if you’re sick and distance yourself from others.

Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Over 5.89 million.
Received at least one shot: Over 2.72 million or 86.5% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.

834,Online Shopping Safety,Here are some tips from fraud investigators with the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office and San Diego County Sheriff’s Department to keep your money safe.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/online-shopping-safety/,2021-12-16T11:19:08-08:00,"
Many people will do more online shopping this holiday season.  Shopping online may be more convenient for some, and others want to avoid shopping at malls and stores as a new COVID variant moves through San Diego County. 
Here are some tips from fraud investigators with the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office and San Diego County Sheriff’s Department to keep your money safe: 

Use one credit card for all online purchases to avoid exposing other cards. 
Don’t click on links from unsolicited emails or text messages. Go to the website instead. Do this by searching for the contact information on your own.  Do not use phone numbers of websites provided on the message. 
Make sure the website is legitimate and secure. Check for the lock icon in the address bar and make sure the address begins with https. 
Update the browser, anti-virus, and malware protection software on your computer. 
Don’t shop on public computers. Use a home computer on a secured network or use your phone on a secured Wi-Fi system. 
Create a unique password for every online account.  Use at least eight letters and a combination of numbers, letters, and symbols. 
Do not trust sellers who ask you to pay with a wire transfer, prepaid debit cards, or gift cards. 
Only download apps from a trusted app store or online platform. 
Monitor your bank statements for unauthorized transactions.

835,It’s the Most Recyclable Time of the Year!,"It’s the most — recyclable — time of the year! Think about it. The holiday season brings all kinds of recyclable things into our homes, from wrapping paper and packages, to yes, even our Christmas trees if you’re using a real one.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/its-the-most-recyclable-time-of-the-year/,2021-12-17T08:22:45-08:00,"
It’s the most — recyclable — time of the year!
Think about it. The holiday season brings all kinds of recyclable things into our homes, from wrapping paper and packages, to yes, even our Christmas trees if you’re using a real one.
And these days, having blue bins for recyclable materials right at home, recycling is a snap. With that in mind and in keeping with the holiday spirit, the County’s Department of Public Works would like to give everyone a gift — some handy recycling tips, what to recycle and what not to put into your blue bins!
Remember, don’t take a holiday from recycling!
Christmas Trees
If you have a real Christmas tree, you’ll eventually have to bid it goodbye. The County urges you to recycle it the right way. Check with your waste hauler to find out if they offer curbside pickup; many do. You can also cut your real tree up and put it in your green organics bin or go to the County’s recycling and hazardous waste database WastefreeSD.org to find Christmas tree drop-off sites near you. Make sure to remove all ornaments, garland, lights, nails, tree bags, tree stands (metal or plastic) and tinsel before recycling.
Real tree wreaths can also be recycled by placing them in your green organics bin. Leaving them lying in your backyard can turn them into fire hazards. Properly recycled trees and wreaths can be turned into mulch that will improve soil health and help soil retain moisture at our parks, farms, home gardens and landscapes.
Know What Packaging Can — and Can’t — be Recycled
Gift-giving and online shopping typically means collecting lots of packaging. Not all packaging can be recycled. For example, cardboard boxes can be recycled; just break them down and put them into your recycling bin. And non-metallic wrapping paper can go into your blue bin. But other items can’t — manila envelopes, padded plastic mailers and cushioning material, and traditional gift-wrapping materials including ribbons, bows, twine, tissue paper and cellophane. So please do not put them in your blue recycling bins; consider re-using them instead. Here’s a link to learn more about how to Recycle Right, during the holidays and every day.
Christmas and Holiday Card Recycling
Like packaging materials, not all holiday cards should be added to your recycling bin. Simple paper cards and envelopes can be added to your blue bins. But cards that have glitter, foil, metallic inks (inks made with tiny metal flakes) or other adornments can’t. If there’s a glitzy front and plain paper backing, tear the cards in two. Recycle the backs and put the glitzy fronts into the trash.
Holiday Light Recycling
Please — don’t put old holiday lights in your recycling bins. They can tangle up recycling equipment and they also pose a danger to workers in those recycling centers. For recycling options, please visit WasteFreeSD.org, or contact a scrap metal or e-waste recycler.
Here’s a pictorial list of what — and what not — to put in your blue recycling bins.
So there you have it. Remember, if you have other questions about what can and can’t be recycled, go to DPW Recycling’s webpage or to DPW Recycling’s Facebook page.

836,Mouse Tests Positive for Hantavirus,"One western harvest mouse collected in routine monitoring in the Black Mountain Ranch area has tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/mouse-tests-positive-for-hantavirus-3/,2021-12-17T09:26:33-08:00,"
One western harvest mouse collected in routine monitoring in the Black Mountain Ranch area has tested positive for hantavirus, County environmental health officials said this week.
The discovery prompted County officials to remind people never to sweep up or vacuum up after rodents if they find them in their homes, garages, sheds or cabins. People should use “wet-cleaning” methods instead, to keep from potentially breathing in the virus and getting sick.
It is not uncommon to find hantavirus in wild rodents in San Diego County. This is the tenth detection this year and there were there were 25 detections in 2020.
The virus can cause deadly infections in people and there is no vaccine or cure. However people are rarely exposed to it because wild rodents tend to live away from people. People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed the virus in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries, is stirred into the air and people breathe it in.
Because of that, County officials said people should never sweep or vacuum up if they find rodent nests or signs of rodents in their homes. If people must clean they should use “wet cleaning” methods — using bleach, disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

For more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality (DEHQ) at (858) 694-2888 or visit the DEHQ hantavirus web page.

837,Update: Shigella Outbreak in San Diego County — 12-17-2021,"The County of San Diego has announced the ongoing outbreak of shigella now stands at 46 confirmed and five probable cases, with slowing cases up one from a week ago and three since the 41 confirmed and seven probable cases reported in the Dec. 3 update.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/update-shigella-outbreak-in-san-diego-county-12-17-2021/,2021-12-17T16:45:15-08:00,"
The County of San Diego has announced the ongoing outbreak of shigella now stands at 46 confirmed and five probable cases, with slowing cases up one from a week ago and a total of three since the 41 confirmed and seven probable cases reported in the Dec. 3 update.
The continuing investigation shows onset of illness dates between Aug. 16 and Nov. 21, 2021, with the new cases occurring between Nov.15 and Nov. 21, 2021, with symptom onset for the latest case being Nov. 27, 2021. The 51 cases in this outbreak represent 13% of the 402 total cases reported to date in San Diego County.
The County Public Health shigella website includes an epidemiological curve showing declining case numbers in recent weeks.
The cases are among individuals experiencing homelessness, with the majority at multiple locations in central San Diego and two cases in North County.
No source of the outbreak has currently been identified.
The County continues to work closely with the City of San Diego, regional homeless service providers and others to identify new cases, prevent future potential exposures and promote good hygienic and sanitation precautions.
Shigella is a contagious infection typically spread by contaminated surfaces, food or water, or person to person. Those at increased risk include young children (especially those in daycare), people who are experiencing homelessness, travelers to locations with poor sanitation and men who have sex with men. In 2020, a total of 240 shigellosis cases were reported in San Diego County residents while the 426 cases reported in 2019 was the highest since 1995.
Typical symptoms of shigellosis include diarrhea (sometimes bloody), fever and stomach cramps. While most people will recover fully without antibiotic treatment, some individuals with poor immune systems can develop life-threatening disease and may need further treatment.  People with symptoms that resemble shigella should contact their medical care provider. The provider may order stool testing to help with the diagnosis.
Strategies to avoid getting or spreading shigella include frequent hand washing and not preparing food while ill with diarrhea.
More information about shigella and precautions are available through the County, a California Health Alert Network notification, the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The next regularly scheduled shigella outbreak news release will appear Thursday, December 30.

841,COVID-19 Oral Treatment Available in San Diego in Coming Days,Medical providers in San Diego County will soon have a new option for treating COVID-19 patients after the Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorizations for two new oral antiviral medications.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-oral-treatment-available-in-san-diego-in-coming-days/,2021-12-23T13:31:51-08:00,"
Medical providers in San Diego County will soon have a new option for treating COVID-19 patients after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued emergency use authorizations for two new oral antiviral medications. However, supplies of these medications will initially be very limited and San Diegans should continue to mask up this holiday season to prevent infection.
The County expects its first shipment of Pfizer’s Paxlovid in the coming days. A second oral antiviral, Merck’s molnupiravir, is expected to start arriving in the region soon after.
A prescription from a medical provider will be required for either drug. Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir are administered over the course of several days in pill form. Both will be available to patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms who are at risk of progressing to severe coronavirus disease, including hospitalization or death.
“The FDA’s emergency use authorization of these new oral antivirals comes at a critical point in the pandemic as we see an increase in cases and a rapid spread of the Omicron variant,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “However, news of the arrival of these drugs does not mean we can let our guard down. We need to continue to mask up, especially in crowded indoor spaces, and I urge anyone who has not gotten vaccinated, or is overdue for their booster shot, to get vaccinated as soon as possible.”
Once the new oral antiviral treatments arrive in the region, they will initially be distributed through about two dozen area pharmacies. Pharmacy locations were pre-selected by the California Department of Public Health. The amount each pharmacy is receiving is based on community impact from the pandemic.
The state and County will expand distribution to more pharmacy locations as supplies increase.

843,COVID-19 Isolation Guidance Shortened from 10 to 5 Days,"Most San Diegans who test positive for COVID-19 only have to isolate for five days, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-isolation-guidance-shortened-from-10-to-5-days/,2021-12-28T12:59:54-08:00,"
Most San Diegans who test positive for COVID-19 only have to isolate for five days, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The County is now following the new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which decreased the isolation period from 10 to five days for most people with no symptoms but who test positive for COVID-19. The California Department of Public Health also aligns with this guidance.
In addition to isolating for five days, COVID-19 patients with no symptoms must wear a mask for an additional five days when around other people. Health care personnel may have different criteria.
“The County is following the CDC guidance because science shows the majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission occurs early in the course of illness, typically 1-2 days prior to developing symptoms and the 2-3 days after,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People with no symptoms can leave isolation after that, provided they wear an appropriate mask to decrease the risk to others.”
Below are additional changes made by the CDC:

The quarantine period for people exposed to COVID-19 is now 5 days followed by strict mask use for an additional 5 days for people who are unvaccinated or fully vaccinated but have not received their booster shot.
If a 5-day quarantine is not feasible, exposed people must wear a well-fitting mask at all times when around others for 10 days after exposure.
People who have gotten their booster shot do not need to quarantine following an exposure but should wear a mask for 10 days after the exposure.
People who are exposed to COVID-19 should get tested at day 5 after exposure.
If symptoms develop, people should immediately isolate until a negative test confirms it’s not COVID-19.

“The new guidance also works to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, which has led to a significant increase in cases nationally and in San Diego County,” Wooten said.
The County is updating its web pages, communication materials and health orders, as well as communication to medical providers and sector partners.
COVID-19 Cases, Testing and Vaccinations
The County has reported a considerable increase in COVID-19 cases in recent days, with daily case counts reaching over 2,300 cases four out of the past six days, including 2,367 cases which will be reported later today.
County health officials are urging San Diegans to take every precaution necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 during the winter months.
In addition to the County testing sites, many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing. Here’s a list of other locations where people can get COVID-19 tests. The overall testing system has the capacity to meet demand. However, testing traffic can surge and sites can be very busy.
The County is recommending for people not to  go to a hospital for COVID-19 testing, to contact their health care provider if they have symptoms and need testing, and to get CA Notify to receive alerts if they were in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19. Rapid antigen tests, which are available at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable.
Also, the region now has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses, which remain the best long-term protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
There are more than 400 vaccination sites that include pharmacies, medical providers, clinics and County locations; the region has the capacity to meet demand. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.

844,Season’s First Flu Death Reported,"A 42-year-old man from the North Central region of the county is the first influenza death reported in San Diego this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/seasons-first-flu-death-reported/,2021-12-29T11:18:02-08:00,"
A 42-year-old man from the North Central region of the county is the first influenza death reported in San Diego this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The man died on Dec. 9. He had underlying medical conditions and had not been vaccinated against influenza. He tested negative for COVID-19.
Influenza cases also continued to increase last week.
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 192 lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week ending Dec. 25, a slight increase from the previous week when 188 flu infections were reported.
“Vaccination is the best defense we have against the flu,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Flu season generally peaks between December and February, and this season’s first flu death reminds us that San Diegans who have not gotten immunized should do it now to protect themselves from becoming ill.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the weekly Influenza Watch report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Dec. 25, 2021, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 192 (compared to 188 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,052 (compared to 54 at the same time last season and a 1,699 prior 5-year average during the same week)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

846,"County Reports Over 3,600 New COVID-19 Cases","The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases, adding 3,653 new cases in a single day today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reports-over-3600-new-covid-19-cases/,2021-12-29T18:44:30-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a sharp increase in new COVID-19 cases, adding 3,653 new cases in a single day today. This is the highest number of new cases reported since Jan. 7 of this year, when 4,550 cases were reported.
County health officials attribute the spike in cases to holiday gatherings and the more contagious Omicron variant.
While the majority of cases in the region are still Delta variant infections, an additional 69 Omicron cases were reported in the past week (Dec. 22 through Dec. 28), bringing the region’s total of known Omicron variant cases to 91.
Testing Resources
While testing demand is high, the overall testing system has the capacity to meet demand. Testing is available throughout the region, including at County testing sites and neighborhood pharmacies.
The County is recommending that people worried about COVID-19 infection and others seeking COVID-19 testing not go to a hospital to be tested, unless they have severe symptoms. This preserves hospital resources for patients who are critically ill.
Those with mild COVID-19 symptoms or other COVID concerns should contact their health care provider via phone or telehealth for guidance. Rapid antigen tests, which are available at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable.
Here’s a list of other locations where people can get COVID-19 tests.
Avoid Getting Sick
Meanwhile, County health officials are urging San Diegans to take every precaution necessary to avoid getting sick and slowing the spread.
“Given the significant uptick in COVID-19 cases, the continued spread of the more contagious Omicron variant, and the increased risks of spread that come with gathering with others, San Diegans must continue to make decisions with their own health and the public’s health in mind,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “As we close out this difficult year, the best resolution we can make for 2022 is to rededicate ourselves to the public health strategies that have been proven to work.”
Those strategies include:

Wearing the right kind of mask and wearing it correctly
Limiting indoor activities when gathering with people outside your household
If you have symptoms, get tested whether you’ve been vaccinated or not, and isolate until results are known
If you test positive, stay home, isolate and seek treatment if necessary

San Diegans who have not been vaccinated, or are overdue for their booster, are strongly encouraged to get vaccinated as soon as possible. There are more than 400 vaccination sites across the county, including at pharmacies, medical providers, clinics and County locations.
More information about COVID-19 vaccination is available here.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Close to 6.14 million.
Received at least one shot: Over 2.77 million or 88.2% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.46 million or 78.2 %.
Boosters administered: 748,737.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

27 new deaths were reported since the last report on Dec. 22, 2021. The region’s total is 4,461.
11 women and 16 men died between Sept. 11 and Dec. 26, 2021.
Eight were age 80 or older, nine were in their 70s, seven were in their 60s, two were in their 50s and one was in their 40s.
Two of the people who died were fully vaccinated and 25 were not fully vaccinated.
24 had underlying medical conditions and three had medical history pending.

Cases, Hospitalizations, Case Rates and Testing:

3,653 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County on Dec. 28, 2021. The region’s total is now 420,089.
16,657 cases were identified the previous week (Dec. 22 through Dec. 28) compared to 7,507 cases reported in the past week (Dec. 15 through Dec. 21).
During the 30-day period between Nov. 16 to Dec. 15, there were 486 COVID-19 hospitalizations; 350 people were not fully vaccinated and 136 were fully vaccinated.
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents is 20.0 overall, 11.4 for fully vaccinated people and 36.0 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.

Community Setting Outbreaks:

47 new community outbreaks were confirmed in the past seven days (Dec. 22 through Dec. 28): 12 in business settings, six in daycare/preschool/childcare settings, five in faith-based agency settings, five in restaurant/bar settings, five in TK-12 grade school settings, four in retail settings, two in emergency services settings, two in government settings, two in healthcare settings, one in a community-based organization, one in a distribution warehouse setting, one in a grocery setting and one in a hotel/resort/spa setting.
The community outbreaks trigger is more than seven in a 7-day period.

847,Increasing COVID-19 Cases Reported; Public Urged to Avoid Large New Year’s Celebrations,"As we approach the new year, San Diego County has continued to see a rise in cases. A total of 5,976 COVID-19 cases was reported Dec. 29, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/increasing-covid-19-cases-reported-public-urged-to-avoid-large-new-years-celebrations/,2021-12-30T16:01:07-08:00,"
As we approach the new year, San Diego County has continued to see a rise in cases. A total of 5,976 COVID-19 cases was reported Dec. 29, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
That’s why County health officials are urging San Diegans to keep New Year’s celebrations small and limit them to family and close friends who are vaccinated and boosted if eligible to prevent the surge of COVID-19 cases that occurred last winter. The County is also asking the public and businesses to continue following the current state and local guidance to slow the spread.
“We get it. People are tired of the pandemic, but given the record number of cases, the brisk emergence of Omicron and the increased risks that come with gatherings, San Diegans must continue to make decisions to protect themselves and others,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “If you have New Year’s celebrations, limit them to people who live with you and make sure everyone present uses the strategies we know work.”
Kaiser says if people gather with others outside their household, they should:

Wear the right kind of mask and wear it correctly
Limit indoor activities, especially if not everyone’s vaccination status is known
If you have symptoms, stay home, get tested –whether you’ve been vaccinated or not– and isolate until you get a negative result and you’re feeling better
If you test positive, stay home, isolate in accordance with CDC guidance and seek treatment if necessary
Get CA Notifyto receive alerts if you were in close contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19.

“We all have the power to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Let’s use it,” Kaiser said.
Testing remains an important tool to slow the spread of COVID-19 and the County has an extensive network of no-cost testing public sites that are both walk-up and can take appointments.
The County recommends that people worried about COVID-19 infection and others seeking COVID-19 testing only go to a hospital to be tested if they have severe symptoms. This preserves hospital resources for patients who are critically ill. The County is closely monitoring hospitalization rates during these recent large case increases.
Those with mild COVID-19 symptoms should contact their health care provider via phone or telehealth for guidance. Rapid antigen tests, which are available at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable.
In addition to the County testing sites, many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing. Here’s a list of other locations where people can get COVID-19 tests. The overall testing system has the capacity to meet demand. However, testing traffic can surge and sites can be very busy.

848,Tuberculosis Case Reported at Sycuan Casino,"A person at Sycuan Casino was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed patrons and employees, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-case-reported-at-sycuan-casino/,2022-01-03T17:35:45-08:00,"
A person at Sycuan Casino was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed patrons and employees, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The dates of exposure were from April 1, 2021 to December 9, 2021. HHSA is working with Sycuan Casino officials to notify those who were potentially exposed.
Tuberculosis is transmitted from person to person through indoor air during prolonged contact with an infectious person. The exposure risk for patrons was low due to COVID-19 safety measures like masks, social distancing and divider walls in place at the casino.
“While many people exposed to tuberculosis do not become infected, some will be, and an early infection may not show any symptoms,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Although we don’t think this is a high-risk exposure, testing is recommended for employees who may have been exposed to the infected individual for a significant period of time.”
Symptoms of infectious tuberculosis include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss. People with symptoms of TB, or who are immune-compromised and may not show obvious symptoms, should consult their medical provider to be evaluated for the bacteria. Tuberculosis can be cured with an extended course of specific antibiotics.
People who would like more information on this potential exposure should contact the San Diego County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.
Tuberculosis is not uncommon in the San Diego region and, although decreasing since the early 1990s, case counts have stabilized in recent years. In 2020, 192 cases were reported in San Diego County. Last year’s TB case numbers have not been finalized yet, but so far, 164 cases have been reported in 2021.

849,Flu Activity Slows with COVID-19 Preventative Measures in Place,"While influenza activity in the region is currently lower compared to other recent seasons, cases for this season are higher than last, and County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to get vaccinated to prevent getting sick with the flu.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-activity-slows-with-covid-19-preventative-measures-in-place/,2022-01-05T12:07:10-08:00,"
While influenza activity in the region is currently lower compared to other recent seasons, cases for this season are higher than last, and County health officials continue to urge San Diegans to get vaccinated to prevent getting sick with the flu.
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 139 lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week ending Jan. 1, a decrease from the previous week when 185 flu infections were reported.
Flu numbers can vary week to week, but County health officials believe lower influenza case counts may be the result of state COVID-19 mask mandates and other preventive measures San Diegans are taking to fight the spread of COVID-19.
“We’re seeing record numbers of COVID-19 infections in our community right now, and you don’t want to get the flu and COVID at the same time,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Get vaccinated against the flu as soon as you can. Every flu case prevented makes more resources available to defeat COVID-19, and means you’re not getting sick – or worse.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the weekly Influenza Watch report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Jan. 1, 2022, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 7% of all visits (compared with 5% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 139 (compared to 185 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,185 (compared to 224 at the same time last season and a 2,820 prior 5-year average during the same week)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

In 2020, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. In 2019, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

850,San Diegans Urged to Not Go to Emergency Departments for COVID-19 Testing,County health officials are urging San Diegans not to go to local emergency departments for COVID-19 testing.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-not-go-to-emergency-departments-for-covid-19-testing/,2022-01-05T18:11:11-08:00,"
County health officials are urging San Diegans not to go to local emergency departments for COVID-19 testing.
Local hospitals are experiencing an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations, as well as staff shortages due to the coronavirus and are preserving their resources for patients who are seriously ill.
The County recommends that people worried about COVID-19 infection and others seeking COVID-19 testing only go to a hospital to be tested if they have severe symptoms.
“Do not go to an emergency department just to get tested, and only go when you have symptoms that need emergency care,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “If you’re experiencing no COVID-19 symptoms, have mild illness or have not been exposed to someone who tested positive, go to one of the many testing locations available in the region.”
The region’s healthcare providers offer testing to members who meet each systems’ criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same day testing as do other locations on this list. The County, which has about 10 percent of the region’s testing capacity, has a network of no-cost testing public sites that are both walk-up and can take appointments.
Together, all testing sites have the capacity to perform about 45,000 tests daily. Rapid antigen tests, which are available at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable. Those who test positive on a rapid should follow the healthcare guidance and generally do not need a confirmatory PCR test unless instructed by a doctor.
“Currently, there is a high demand for COVID-19 testing so we’re asking San Diegans to be patient as testing traffic can surge and sites can be very busy,” Kaiser said.
Avoid Fake COVID-19 Testing Sites
The County is also warning San Diegans about potential scams from “pop up” sites that are offering “free” COVID-19 testing.
All legitimate COVID-19 testing sites should be able to show you their medical credentials upon request. They should also be able to tell you what laboratory test is being used, where the test is being run and how the results will be reported.
A testing site could be fake if:

They ask for social security numbers or other non-medical information
Materials do not have a logo
Site is on a sidewalk and not affiliated with a medical provider

“San Diegans should be wary as some pop-up sites could be personal information scams. If you have doubts, go to a County or community pharmacy COVID-19 testing site,” Kaiser said.
COVID-19 Vaccines Widely Available
Also, the region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses, which remain the best long-term protection against COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
There are more than 400 vaccination sites that include pharmacies, medical providers, clinics and County locations; the region has the capacity to meet demand. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Over 6.26 million.
Received at least one shot: Nearly 2.79 million or 88.6% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.47 million or 78.5 %.
Boosters administered: 820,766.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

854,"San Diegans Should Get Boosters, Test Only As Needed, Work from Home","Due to markedly increasing COVID-19 cases and the resulting strain on the local health care system, County health officials are urging San Diegans to get all the recommended vaccines and to get tested only as necessary.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-should-get-boosters-test-only-as-needed-work-from-home/,2022-01-07T17:12:26-08:00,"
Due to markedly increasing COVID-19 cases and the resulting strain on the local health care system, County health officials are urging San Diegans to get all the recommended vaccines and to get tested only as necessary.
In the past month, confirmed COVID-19 cases jumped from about 4,700 per week to more than 45,000 cases reported in the seven days between Dec. 29, 2021 through Jan. 4, 2022. That is nearly a tenfold increase in just 30 days.
COVID-19 hospitalizations have also more than doubled in the past 30 days, from 320 to 774, putting a strain on local hospitals that are contending with hundreds of employees unable to work after contracting the virus.
“We’re now seeing the highest local case counts of the pandemic. COVID-19 is everywhere,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., County public health officer. “The best way to slow the spread of COVID-19 is to have as much immunity as possible and to take other precautions that we know work.”
While we are in this highly active COVID-19 period, Wooten is urging San Diegans to:

Get vaccinated
Get a booster when eligible. Boosters are now available and recommended for everyone 12 years and older
Wear a tight-fitting mask indoors when in public places. The state currently requires masks in indoor public places
Get tested only if you have symptoms.
Stay home if you’re sick.
If you test positive at home, isolate for at least five days. A PCR test is not needed to confirm a positive rapid antigen test.
Seek treatment from your doctor if you have moderate to severe symptoms.
Employers should be flexible and if the job allows, let employees work remotely for their safety and the wellbeing of those around them.

“While our COVID-19 testing capacity is high, demand has skyrocketed, leading to long lines and waits. Testing should be reserved for those at higher risk of serious illness and people who need it the most,” Wooten said.
County health officials recommend that only people with symptoms needing emergency care should go to a hospital emergency department.  People should not go to an emergency department for testing with no or mild COVID symptoms.
The region’s health care providers offer testing to members who meet each systems’ criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing as do other locations. The County, which has about 10% of the region’s testing capacity, has a network of no-cost testing public sites that are both walk-up and can take appointments.

855,County Breaks Ground on Affordable Housing Complex in Escondido,The County today broke ground on a new 50-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors and older people who are homeless and have a serious mental illness.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-breaks-ground-on-affordable-housing-complex-in-escondido/,2022-01-10T14:16:25-08:00,"
The County today broke ground on a new 50-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors and older people who are homeless and have a serious mental illness.
The Valley Senior Village in downtown Escondido will be an affordable community for adults 62 and older. The complex is being built by the County in partnership with National CORE and San Diego Community Housing Corporation.
“Now more than ever, it’s very important that the County take significant steps to preserve and create affordable housing opportunities throughout the region,” said David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services for the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Valley Senior Village is a significant step in this effort.”
Valley Senior Village is expected to be completed by summer 2023.
Valley Senior Village will offer residents an array of medical and mental health programs and services, including case management, designed to promote stability and independence. The services will be provided by the Hope through Housing Foundation, San Ysidro Health, and Interfaith Community Services through a contract with County Behavioral Health Services.
The $24 million complex includes about $10 million from the County’s Innovative Housing Trust Fund and No Place Like Home capital and operating funding, ensuring the development remains affordable in the community of Escondido for 99 years.
The Innovative Housing Trust Fund was established by the County to provide gap financing for developments that created and/or preserved affordable housing. The $50 million invested in the Trust Fund has leveraged $567 million in other public and private funds to create and preserve 1,397 permanent affordable housing units within 20 developments in 15 communities throughout San Diego County. In Aug. 2021, the Board of Supervisors increased funding by $20 million for a total of $70 million. The No Place Like Home Program provides capital and operating subsidies for permanent supportive housing. The No Place Like Home funding will total nearly $130 million for regionwide housing development.
Valley Senior Village is expected to be completed by summer 2023.

856,"County Reports Record COVID Cases, Urges San Diegans to Take Precautions","The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, even when factoring in that more than a third of the results from the previous three days are due to reporting delays from last week.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reports-record-covid-cases-urges-san-diegans-to-take-precautions/,2022-01-10T18:52:54-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting record numbers of new COVID-19 cases, even when factoring in that more than a third of the results from the previous three days are due to reporting delays from last week.
The record cases include 12,563 new cases reported for Sunday, 17,507 for Saturday and 19,009 for Friday. The previous daily high in cases was 8,313 reported for Jan. 2, 2022.
The surge in new COVID infections comes as local hospitals are struggling with staffing amid hundreds of their employees contracting the virus and being unable to report to their shifts.
“We expected to see a surge after the holidays, especially with the arrival of the more transmissible Omicron variant, but these numbers are unprecedented in this pandemic,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The virus is everywhere in our community. We must all step up now and re-dedicate ourselves to the precautions that we know work.”
This includes:

Getting vaccinated
Getting a booster when eligible. Boosters are now available and recommended for everyone 12 years and older.
Wearing a tight-fitting mask indoors when in public places. The state currently requires masks in indoor public places.
Getting tested only if you have symptoms.
Staying home if you’re sick.
If you test positive at home, isolate for at least five days. A PCR test is not needed to confirm a positive rapid antigen test.
Seeking treatment from your doctor if you have moderate to severe symptoms.
Employers should be flexible and if the job allows, let employees work remotely for their safety and the wellbeing of those around them.

Wooten also said that there is a misconception about the Omicron variant being far less dangerous or deadly than prior strains of COVID-19.
“Hospitalizations are increasing amid this current surge and it’s important to understand that hospital admissions are a lagging indicator,” Wooten said. “We expect hospital admissions to increase even further in the coming weeks as people who are currently ill develop more severe symptoms.”
To help alleviate the strain on local hospitals and prepare them for the expected surge in admissions, County health officials recommend that only people with symptoms needing emergency care should go to a hospital emergency department.
At this time, COVID-19 testing should be reserved for those at higher risk of serious illness and people who need it the most. People should not go to an emergency department for testing with no or mild COVID symptoms.
The region’s health care providers offer testing to members who meet each systems’ criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing as do other locations.

857,Board of Supervisors Approves New Gun Storage and Safety Law,The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to enact a new ordinance to set standards for safe storage of firearms and to put restrictions on non-serialized guns commonly called “ghost guns.”,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-of-supervisors-approves-new-gun-storage-and-safety-law/,2022-01-11T13:38:27-08:00,"
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to enact a new ordinance to set standards for safe storage of firearms and to put restrictions on non-serialized guns commonly called “ghost guns.”
A key component of the County ordinance is the requirement that all guns in homes be stored in a locked container or disabled with a trigger lock.
Another element of the new ordinance regulates the possession and distribution of guns and gun parts built or purchased without serial numbers. The so-called “ghost guns” are a problem in the community because they can’t be traced and are often sold to people restricted from owning a weapon.
The new ordinance prohibits possessing, purchasing, selling, transferring, receiving, or transporting non-serialized firearms or non-serialized parts for guns such as frames and receivers.
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher expanded on a suggestion by Supervisor Jim Desmond to collect data on gun violence in an annual report. Supervisors Joel Anderson and Desmond voted against the ordinance.
If a second reading of the ordinance is approved on January 25, the new law would take effect in February 2022, but several sections of the ordinance may not be immediately enforced to allow time for people with existing items to dispose of those guns and parts.

858,New County Probation Chief Brings Expertise and Diversity,The San Diego County Probation Department has a new Chief to lead the department's transformation and support the successful transition of people back to the community.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-county-probation-chief-brings-expertise-and-diversity/,2022-01-11T13:39:05-08:00,"
The San Diego County Probation Department has a new Chief to lead the department’s transformation and support the successful transition of people back to the community.
Tamika Nelson is the first woman to lead the County’s probation department.  She recently served as the Assistant Chief Probation Officer in San Joaquin County, managing a department with more than 350 sworn and non-sworn personnel.  In her position with San Joaquin County, Assistant Chief Nelson helped deploy evidence-based case management approaches to increase public safety and reduce recidivism.
She also helped expand transitional services such as behavioral health services, community-based support services and educational services to youth and families to improve the lives of justice-involved clients.
Nelson led a committee to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in San Joaquin County.
“I’m humbled and honored by this opportunity to serve the community of San Diego as the Chief Probation Officer,” Nelson said. “I’m excited to bring my experience with nurturing collaborative relationships, evidenced-based practices, and data-driven decision making to a highly motivated and innovative team. I’m looking forward to further collaborations with stakeholders and the community to do our part in pursuing public safety.”
Nelson will lead the Probation Department in its mission to provide the highest quality of service through a continuum of services, family and community engagement, restorative practices, and employee-focused enrichment. The San Diego County Probation Department includes 1,009 employees with a budget of $236 million and is a part of the County’s Public Safety Group.
“Everyone deserves a second chance, especially young people who have taken a wrong turn in life,” said Nathan Fletcher, Chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “We are reimagining the services we provide to youth, opening new facilities that align with our goals, and we’ve hired new leadership to help us drive change in the probation department. I look forward to working closely with our new Chief Probation Officer Tamika Nelson, her background, experience rehabilitating justice-involved youth, and values align with the new direction we are taking our county.”
Tamika Nelson attended the University of California, San Diego and earned her Juris Doctor from the Humphreys School of Law in Stockton.

859,San Diego Flu Cases Continue to Decline Amid COVID-19 Measures,"A total of 81 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the San Diego area last week, a 40 percent decrease from the 137 cases reported the week before, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-flu-cases-continue-to-decline-amid-covid-19-measures/,2022-01-12T12:57:18-08:00,"
A total of 81 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the San Diego area last week, a 40 percent decrease from the 137 cases reported the week before, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
While influenza activity in the region is much lower compared to previous seasons, County health officials are urging San Diegans to get vaccinated to prevent getting sick at a time when hospitals are being inundated with COVID-19 patients.
“With widespread transmission of COVID-19 in our community, it’s so important that all San Diegans do their part to prevent illness,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “I urge anyone who has not gotten the flu vaccine, to get vaccinated now. The flu vaccine is safe and effective, and you can get it at the same time as your COVID-19 booster.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency publishes the weekly Influenza Watch  report, which tracks key flu indicators and summarizes influenza surveillance in the region.
For the week ending Jan. 8, 2022, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 8% of all visits (compared with 7% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 81 (compared to 137 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,262 (compared to 589 at the same time last season and a 4,002 prior 5-year average during the same week)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

An independent panel of local doctors today participated in a virtual event that addressed COVID-19 misinformation brought up by members of the public at the Jan. 11 County Board of Supervisors meeting.
The virtual session was available to the public for live viewing and the two doctors who participated dispelled misleading claims about COVID-19.
The panel was moderated by Dr. Eric McDonald, County chief medical officer and included Dr. John Bradley from Rady Children’s Hospital and Dr. Christian Ramers from Family Health Centers of San Diego.
Both have worked on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic since the virus was first identified here in San Diego. Their discussion included the impact of COVID-19 in children, the current understanding of the severity of the Omicron variant compared to previous strains, misstatements about co-morbidities and COVID deaths, the early therapies for COVID infection that are or are not helpful, the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, as well as other issues that came up at the Board of Supervisors meeting.
County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency staff regularly track COVID-19 misinformation shared during public comment at the Board of Supervisors meetings.
In August of last year, San Diego County became the first jurisdiction in the nation to declare health misinformation a public health crisis. Others have since followed.
The County has also launched a website to debunk common false claims about COVID-19 and educate people on where to find credible medical information sources.
A video of the virtual event is available on the coronavirus-sd.com website.

861,Board Unanimously Approves 2-year Home Kitchen Ordinance,The Board of Supervisors Wednesday unanimously approved a two-year temporary authorization of an ordinance that will ultimately allow people to legally operate “mini-restaurants” out of their homes.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-of-supervisors-unanimously-approve-home-kitchen-ordinance/,2022-01-12T16:09:43-08:00,"
The Board of Supervisors Wednesday unanimously approved a two-year temporary authorization of an ordinance that will ultimately allow people to legally operate “mini-restaurants” out of their homes.
They could serve as many as 30 in-person, take-out, or delivery meals a day, with a maximum of 60 meals a week. Operators will be required to get a health permit, and home kitchens must pass food safety inspections.
Vice Chair Nora Vargas and Supervisor Joel Anderson, who brought a request to draft an ordinance for microenterprise home kitchen operations, or MEHKOs, to the Board in September, said Wednesday that the home kitchens wouldn’t compete with established restaurants but would help local communities, the economy and people with cooking skills trying to make ends meet.
“Legally implemented MEHKOS can serve as incubators for aspiring restaurateurs to test out and vet a menu while learning the basics of what it takes to run a small-scale retail operation,” Vargas said. “I want to make sure that families and businesses in our region are thriving, not just surviving, and this opens the door for home cooks to do just that.”
Anderson said MEHKOS also provide a great service to communities “because people are getting quality food from their neighbors.”
“On every level I just believe this is a terrific program,” Anderson said.
County staff said comments collected in public meetings and hearings stated that microenterprise kitchens could have numerous potential economic and community benefits. They would give aspiring restaurateurs a way to earn a living and way to test their skills and ideas for an overall startup cost of about $740, rather than spending the estimated $275,000 average cost of opening a storefront restaurant. They would also provide “food justice” and healthy, home-cooked meals for communities that don’t have lots of restaurants or that lack access to healthy food.
California established a MEHKO addition to the California Retail Food Code in 2019. The code is the state law that establishes health and sanitation standards and regulates food facilities. The County of San Diego is the regional local authority that conducts health inspections for all restaurants and food facilities and is the governing body to consider MEHKO authorization for all jurisdictions in the region.
The state law allows microenterprise kitchens with restrictions. Some of those include:

They must be operated by a resident living in the home or apartment
They cannot have more than one full-time employee excluding family members.
Food must be prepared and served on the same day and sold directly to consumers.
They’re limited to $50,000 in sales a year.
They cannot operate as caterers, temporary event vendors, mobile event vendors or cottage food operators that prepare and sell packaged foods.

Home cooks who want to operate a microenterprise kitchen would be required to submit an application, earn a food safety manager certificate from an approved school, pass an initial inspection, and undergo annual inspections. Kitchens that rely upon well water would also have to conduct private well tests to ensure the water is safe.
The Department of Environmental Health and Quality conducted approximately 50 stakeholder meetings to inform the drafting of the ordinance, including four public workshops with language translators, meetings with other public agencies, chambers of commerce and city councils.
Because the Board’s action creates a new ordinance to oversee regulation, it will need to be authorized again at a “second reading” Jan. 26, which will allow it to take effect 30 days after that.
County staff said they would study local MEHKOS during the two-year temporary authorization of the ordinance and bring back that data to the Board before the ordinance expires for their consideration on whether to make it permanent.

862,San Diegans 12 and Older Should Get COVID-19 Boosters,"Now that COVID-19 vaccine boosters are available for fully vaccinated people age 12 and up, County health officials are urging eligible San Diegans to get all the recommended doses.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-12-and-older-should-get-covid-19-boosters/,2022-01-12T18:48:37-08:00,"
Now that COVID-19 vaccine boosters are available for fully vaccinated people ages 12 and up, County health officials are urging eligible San Diegans to get all the recommended doses.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a booster shot helps to provide protection against the highly contagious Omicron variant, both in preventing the disease, lessening symptoms and decreasing the likelihood of hospitalization.
To date, 906,615 San Diegans have received booster shots. The CDC recommends a Pfizer or Moderna booster shot five months after their second dose. A Johnson & Johnson booster is recommended two months after the second dose. Pfizer boosters have been approved for everyone 12 years and older. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters are only available for adults 18 years and older.
“COVID-19 vaccinations are the best tool we have against the coronavirus and we need more San Diegans to be boosted,” said Wilma J. Wooten. M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccines help to prevent people from getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19.”
 The region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses. With more than 400 vaccination sites that include pharmacies, medical providers, clinics and County locations; the region has the capacity to meet the demand. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.
 Avoid Emergency Departments for COVID-19 Testing
County health officials continue to ask San Diegans not to go to local emergency departments for COVID-19 testing.
Local hospitals are experiencing an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations, as well as staff shortages due to the coronavirus and are preserving their resources for patients who are seriously ill.
“Local hospitals and their emergency departments are under extreme stress due to COVID-19 patients, other seasonal viruses and diseases and employees calling out sick,” Wooten said.
The County recommends that people worried about COVID-19 infection and others seeking COVID-19 testing go to a hospital to be tested only if they have severe symptoms.
The region’s health care providers offer testing to members who meet each systems’ criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same day testing as do other locations on this list. The County has a network of no-cost testing public sites that are both walk-up and can take appointments.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Over 6.38 million.
Received at least one shot: Over 2.81 million or 89.4% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Nearly 2.49 million or 79%.
Boosters administered: 906,615.

864,The Real Huskies of Bonita Need Forever Homes,"In this County, if you don’t know the canine breed with the most camera appeal, then stay and we’ll introduce you to some fetching aspiring housedogs who are all currently residing in Bonita, a hidden gem of an animal shelter.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/the-real-huskies-of-bonita-need-forever-homes/,2022-01-14T13:49:30-08:00,"
In this County, if you don’t know the canine breed with the most camera appeal, then stay and we’ll introduce you to some fetching aspiring housedogs who are all currently residing in Bonita, a hidden gem of an animal shelter.
The San Diego County Department of Animal Services is dishing up all the treats with its January adoption specials on adult dogs: they only look expensive but they’re actually very down-to-earth.
Animal Services currently has an abundance of young huskies. They are an active breed that are always up for adventure. They need daily exercise and activities otherwise they might find other ways to entertain themselves that could make for some mischief and owner drama. They also need regular brushing to reduce shedding and keep their coats looking fabulous.
“Sometimes people buy pets based on their looks and may not understand the needs of the breed, then become overwhelmed or frustrated,” said Animal Service Director Kelly Campbell. “Huskies can be wonderful dogs for the owners who are prepared for them.”
During the month of January, adoption fees are waived for all adult dogs, even non huskies, at both the Bonita shelter and the Carlsbad shelter.
Meet this season’s husky cast of characters.
Blu Star is a year-old neutered male who keeps one ear up for praise and one down to all the haters. It’s about positivity. His ID number is A1889271, necktag number is S164 and kennel number is S077.

Kylo is also a year-old neutered male who knows how to charm and have a good time. His ID number is A1892979, necktag number is S573 and kennel number is S115.
Oba is a 2-year-old spayed strawberry blonde female who can bat her ice blue and amber eyes at you and steal your heart. Her ID number is A1888596, necktag number is S321 and kennel number is S127.

Storm is a 5-year-old neutered male looking forward to the next phase of the good life. His ID number is A1892286, necktag number is S567 and kennel number is S110.

Mina is a 2-year-old spayed female who makes happiness her lifelong goal. Her ID number is A1887901, necktag number is S376 and kennel number is S098.

Miles is a 5-year-old neutered male who knows a true friend is the best possession. His ID number is A1886931, necktag number is S221 and kennel number is S076.
Due to COVID-19 precautions, Animal Services is offering adoptions by appointment, or walk-ins can be accommodated on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Bonita. If you would like to submit your application to be considered to adopt or foster, please visit the DAS website www.sddac.com and follow the instructions to complete and submit an adoption or foster care application, or call (619) 767-2675 to make an appointment.

865,"Rodent tests positive for hantavirus, first local detection in 2022","A wild vole ― a small, mouse-like rodent ― collected in routine monitoring in an open, rural area in Chula Vista has tested positive for hantavirus, the first local detection of the potentially deadly disease in 2022.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/207599-2/,2022-01-14T14:11:14-08:00,"
A wild vole ― a small, mouse-like rodent ― collected in routine monitoring in an open, rural area in Chula Vista has tested positive for hantavirus, the first local detection of the potentially deadly disease in 2022.
County officials are reminding people to never sweep up or vacuum up after wild rodents if they find them in their homes, garages, sheds, cabins or other living spaces. People should use “wet-cleaning” methods instead to keep from breathing in the virus and getting sick.
Finding hantavirus in wild rodents is not uncommon in San Diego County and there is no vaccine or cure for it. However, people rarely come into contact with hantavirus because wild rodents tend to live away from people.
People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents shed the virus in their urine, feces and saliva, the matter dries, is stirred into the air and people breathe it in.
If people find wild rodents, nests or signs of them in their living spaces and must clean, they should always use “wet cleaning” methods — using bleach or other disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags. They should NOT sweep or vacuum, which could stir hantavirus into the air where it could be inhaled.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

866,County Determines Shigella Outbreak Over,"With no new cases in more than a month, the shigella outbreak declared in October 2021 among people experiencing homelessness is over, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.   ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-determines-shigella-outbreak-over/,2022-01-14T19:12:40-08:00,"
With no new cases in more than a month, the shigella outbreak declared in October 2021 among people experiencing homelessness is over, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The last shigella case connected to the outbreak was identified Dec. 11, 2021, and for over a month, cases have remained at the historical  baseline, which is no more than one case per week in people experiencing homelessness.
On Jan. 14, the County sent a letter to City of San Diego officials informing them that the current outbreak of shigellosis no longer exists. The California Department of Public Health has also deemed this outbreak to be over. The County will continue to closely monitor case counts.
“I want to sincerely thank the City of San Diego for your continued commitment to the promotion of appropriate and proactive hygienic interventions in your jurisdiction,” Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer, said in the missive. “The City’s quick response, as well as the continued communication, coordination, and collaboration with the County, have allowed us to successfully eliminate this outbreak.”
The shigella outbreak was first identified in early October when six people experiencing homelessness were hospitalized due to shigellosis.
On Oct. 11, 2021, the County issued a health advisory to the local medical community to be on the lookout for potential shigella cases.
At the same time, the County began working with the City of San Diego, potential exposure sites, and homeless service providers to mitigate the spread of shigellosis by ensuring good sanitation precautions, expanding public restroom availability, distributing personal hygiene kits, working with food service providers, identifying additional cases, and connecting ill people to treatment and housing.
For three months, the County held regular meetings with the City and other stakeholders to control the shigellosis outbreak, maintained a website to report cases, and issued news updates informing the public about new cases and containment measures being implemented.
In total, 53 shigella cases were connected to the outbreak — 47 confirmed and six probable infections. All cases were identified in people experiencing homelessness. There were no deaths.
The County’s ongoing disease investigation efforts will continue to monitor shigellosis cases and potential outbreaks in the region, providing early intervention as needed. Archived details on this now-closed shigella outbreak can be found here.

867,County’s New District Boundaries Take Effect,More than 1 million San Diego County residents ― three out of every 10 ― woke up Saturday in a new supervisorial district. People can now see the new map online and use a built-in search bar to find out what district they live in.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-new-district-boundaries-take-effect/,2022-01-18T13:40:13-08:00,"
More than 1 million San Diego County residents ― three out of every 10 ― woke up Saturday in a new supervisorial district.
The boundaries of their County districts were revised by an independent redistricting commission that worked for a year with public input.
People can see the new map and use a built-in search bar to find out what district they live in. Type in your address in the “find address or place” bar and the map will pin your location. Clicking the zoom out sign on the map will expand the map until you see the district boundaries and the County district your address is located in.
The general differences between the old boundaries set in 2011 and the new ones can be seen in the map below. The old boundaries are outlined in blue; the new boundaries are depicted by different colors for each district.

Redistricting, the redrawing of political voting boundaries, is done every 10 years using U.S. Census data to ensure that voting districts have roughly equal numbers of people, while reflecting “shifting populations and demographics.”
This redistricting was the first for the County to be done by an independent commission rather than by the County Board of Supervisors. The 14-member Independent Redistricting Commission worked for more than a year, held 49 regular and special meetings, including 10 public hearings, throughout the County and in each of the County’s five supervisorial districts, to create and approve the new maps.
The new maps of the districts the commission submitted to the County Dec. 15 became final Jan. 15 after a 30-day referendum period, setting the new voting and jurisdictional boundaries for the next 10 years.
In consultation with the County Registrar of Voters, on Jan. 12, the commission approved in principle minor technical changes to the final map that shifted 23 unpopulated census blocks from one district to another to facilitate the implementation of the plan for elections. The adjustments had no impact to population of the districts or the intent of the plan.
The commission’s report states that the new redistricting maps meet all legal requirements. Those include maintaining substantially equal population in each district, complying with the federal Voting Rights Act that prohibits racial discrimination in voting and respecting the geographic integrity of city, local neighborhood or communities of interest, to the extent practicable.
The new map divides only one of the county’s 18 cities ― the City of San Diego, which, with more than 1.38 million people, is too populous for a single County district. The new district populations range in size from 636,285 people in District 2 to 689,991 in District 5.
The new map includes one supervisorial district that is a majority Latino district, District 1, currently represented by Supervisor Nora Vargas, with 61.4% of the total population identified as Hispanic/Latino. In general, District 1 includes the cities of Chula Vista, Imperial Beach and National City, portions of the City of San Diego, and unincorporated areas including the communities of Bonita and La Presa, Spring Valley, Sweetwater and Otay.
District 2, currently represented by Supervisor Joel Anderson, generally includes the cities of Poway, Santee and El Cajon, portions of the City of San Diego, and 20 unincorporated communities including Alpine, Boulevard, Campo, Jacumba, Jamul, Julian, Lakeside, Pine Valley and Ramona.
District 3, currently represented by Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer, generally includes the cities of Coronado, Del Mar, Solana Beach, Encinitas and Carlsbad, parts of the City of San Diego and unincorporated communities including Elfin Forest, Fairbanks Ranch, Harmony Grove and Rancho Santa Fe.
District 4, currently represented by Supervisor and Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher, generally includes the cities of Lemon Grove and La Mesa, parts of the City of San Diego, and unincorporated communities including Casa De Oro-Mount Helix, Rancho San Diego and Spring Valley.
District 5, currently represented by Supervisor Jim Desmond, generally includes the cities of Escondido, San Marcos, Oceanside and Vista, and 10 unincorporated communities including Bonsall, Borrego Springs, Fallbrook, Rainbow and Valley Center.
At their next meeting on Jan. 26, the commission will finalize the resolutions incorporating the technical adjustments to redistricting map and final report  approved on Jan. 12.

868,San Diegans Urged to Vaccinate Despite Milder Flu Season,"Influenza cases continued to decrease last week, though County health officials still recommend people get their flu shot for best protection.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-vaccinate-despite-milder-flu-season/,2022-01-19T11:07:47-08:00,"
Influenza cases continued to decrease last week, though County health officials still recommend people get their flu shot for best protection.
According to the latest data from the County Health and Human Services Agency’s Epidemiology and Immunization Services branch , 43 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported the week ending Jan. 15. 2022. That’s 36 fewer cases compared to the previous week. In comparison, 53 flu infections were reported during the same week last season.
“Once again, it appears that some of the same measures San Diegans are taking to prevent getting COVID-19 are also helping to slow down the spread of influenza,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
While the percentage of people at local emergency departments with influenza-like illness also decreased from 8% to 6% last week, influenza is still circulating in the region and San Diegans should continue getting vaccinated against the flu.
“It’s not too late to get a flu shot. When people are vaccinated, they are less likely to develop serious illness and require going to hospitals, which are currently under extreme pressure due to COVID-19,” Wooten said.
The latest Influenza Watch report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending Jan. 15, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 6% of all visits (compared with 8% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 43 (compared to 79 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,304 (compared to 642 at the same time last season and a 5,079 prior 5-year average during the same week)
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 1 (compared to 0 at the same time last year)

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands
Stay away from sick people
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth
Clean commonly touched surfaces
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, a total of 108 San Diegans died from influenza and more than 20,700 flu cases were reported.

869,County Expands COVID-19 Testing to Meet Demand Caused by Omicron,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is continuing to expand regional COVID-19 testing to meet the increased demand brought on by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-expands-covid-19-testing-to-meet-demand-caused-by-omicron/,2022-01-19T19:10:03-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is continuing to expand regional COVID-19 testing to meet the increased demand brought on by the rapid spread of the Omicron variant. The County has a network of free testing sites, both walk-up and appointment-based.
The newest testing center is a site at Palomar YMCA in Escondido that can provide up to 800 tests a day, Monday to Friday. New appointments are made available daily and can be booked up to three days in advance.
However, County-operated test sites are not the only testing option in the region. Local health care providers offer testing to members who meet each systems’ criteria. Many neighborhood pharmacies offer same-day testing as do other locations on this list.
Rapid antigen tests, which are available for purchase at many local pharmacies, are a good option if a testing site is unavailable. You can find information on how to best use rapid tests here.
The federal government rolled out a program this week that allows every residential household in the United States to order up to four at-home COVID-19 test kits free of charge. Tests can be ordered online at COVIDtests.gov. Those ordering the test kits need only provide a name and address. No ID, credit card, or health insurance information is required.
Avoid Hospitals for COVID Testing
Meanwhile, San Diegans should continue to avoid local emergency departments for COVID-19 testing. Area hospitals are experiencing an increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations, as well as staff shortages due to the coronavirus and are preserving their resources for patients who are seriously ill.
The County recommends that people worried about COVID-19 infection and others seeking COVID-19 testing go to a hospital to be tested only if they have severe symptoms.
“There continues to be a lot of virus activity in our community and your best bet for preventing illness is to avoid large crowds, wearing your mask when out in public and getting a booster shot when you are eligible,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Boosters are available for fully vaccinated people ages 12 and older and provide protection against severe outcomes from the highly contagious Omicron variant.”
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Close to 6.48 million.
Received at least one shot: Over 2.83 million or 90.0% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.50 million or 79.5%.
Boosters administered: 959,697.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

24 new deaths were reported since the last report on Jan. 12, 2022. The region’s total is 4,553.
11 women and 13 men died between Dec. 15, 2021 and Jan. 13, 2022.
11 were age 80 or older, four were in their 70s, six were in their 60s, one was in their 50s, one was in their 40s and one was in their 20s.
One of the people who died was fully vaccinated and 23 were not fully vaccinated.
20 had underlying medical conditions and four had medical history pending.

Cases, Hospitalizations, Case Rates and Testing:

69,151 COVID-19 cases were reported last week (Jan. 12 through Jan. 18, 2022) compared to 85,659 cases identified the previous week (Jan. 5 through Jan. 11, 2022).
During the 30-day period between Dec. 7, 2021 to Jan. 5, 2022 there were 729 COVID-19 hospitalizations; 419 people were not fully vaccinated and 310 were fully vaccinated.
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents is 209.7 overall, 173.3 for fully vaccinated people and 283.2 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
41,506 tests were reported to the County on Jan. 18, 2022, and the percentage of new positive cases was 22.6%.

872,Board Paves Way for Future of San Pasqual Academy,The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to sustain the future of San Pasqual Academy and expand the services provided at the residential education campus for foster youth.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-paves-way-for-future-of-san-pasqual-academy/,2022-01-25T17:09:04-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to sustain the future of San Pasqual Academy and expand the services provided at the residential education campus for foster youth.
The State of California had directed the County to close the group home located in the San Pasqual Valley near Escondido by the end of last year, but a San Diego Superior Court judge placed an injunction on the closure in December, allowing the campus to continue operating for the foreseeable future.
The plan approved by the Board today will allow the campus to maintain existing services for current students while adapting to changing guidance and regulations from the state.
The Board’s actions let the academy transition to a continuum of care multipurpose campus. It will be able to keep its existing group home license while extending its services to a wider population of youths, including temporary shelter care for foster youths needing emergency or temporary care.
Under the proposed changes, the campus will seek to create onsite family homes, or resource family homes, where youths would live in a homelike environment with several of their peers and one or multiple resource parents. Resource parents are specifically trained to care for youths in the foster care system.
The new plan would also establish transitional housing for current and former foster youths ages 18-24 and allow them to learn self-sufficiency skills in a safe environment. Furthermore, the campus would be able to offer educational, career readiness, mentoring, physical and mental health services to all youths entering the facility and throughout their length of stay.
Once fully operational, the proposed initial stage of the new plan would enable the academy to serve up to 116 youths and eight alumni households. The campus would maintain about 80 beds in the existing education-based residential group home setting and would create an additional 36 beds in resource family home settings.
San Pasqual Academy is a public-private partnership between the County of San Diego, New Alternatives, Inc., San Diego County Office of Education, and Access, Inc. Since the campus opened in 2001, more than 425 students have graduated from the on-site high school and the academy is considered a national model for guiding foster youth on a path toward success.

873,County Reports Second Flu Death of this Season,"An unvaccinated 95-year-old man from the North Coastal region of the county has become the second County resident to die of influenza this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reports-second-flu-death-of-this-season/,2022-01-26T10:35:11-08:00,"
An unvaccinated 95-year-old man from the North Coastal region of the county has become the second County resident to die of influenza this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The man had underlying medical conditions and died on Jan. 5. He was also routinely tested for COVID-19, for which he tested negative.
Meanwhile, influenza cases continued to decrease last week, with 29 new cases being reported for the week ending Jan. 22, 2022. That’s 14 fewer cases compared to the previous week. In comparison, 26 flu infections were reported during the same week last season.
“While the slowing of influenza activity in our region is good news, the new death being reported today is a sad reminder of how dangerous the flu can be,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Protect yourself and your loved ones and get the flu shot. It is the best defense we have against influenza.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending Jan. 22, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (compared with 7% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 29 (compared to 43 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,314 (compared to 668 at the same time last season and a 5,966 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 2 (compared to 0 at the same time last year).

Recently released research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that COVID-19 vaccine boosters are effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalizations.
Despite that, only 1,021,730 or 49.9% of San Diegans who are fully vaccinated have received a booster, according to the County Health and Human Services Agency. That means 1,026,439 are due for a booster. Boosters are currently available for everyone 12 years and older.
“While we’re seeing more breakthrough infections due to the COVID-19 omicron variant, research has shown that significantly fewer people who have received their booster are getting seriously ill and ending up in the hospital,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.
Of the 996 hospitalizations reported in the 30-day period Dec. 14, 2021 through Jan. 12, 2022, a total of 91 (9.1%) San Diegans who were boosted ended up in the hospital.
“San Diegans should get a booster immediately, if they are eligible,” Wooten said.
The region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses. The county has more than 400 vaccination sites including pharmacies, medical providers, clinics, and County locations. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.
Vaccination Progress:

Doses administered: Close to 6.58 million.
Received at least one shot: Over 2.85 million or 90.8% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.51 million or 79.9%.

A new Youth Transition Campus, designed to be less like an outdated correctional facility and more like a therapeutic, rehabilitative campus, is complete in the Kearny Mesa area of San Diego. The Youth Transition Campus supports young people with longer stays in custody and has been designed to reflect national best practices that promote positive youth development and staff well-being. The standards reflect the San Diego County Board of Supervisors’ commitment to provide the resources that help young people succeed and thrive.
“Youth who make poor decisions should be given an opportunity to turn their life around. We want to help them avoid a lifetime of incarceration and find a path of meaning and purpose” said Nathan Fletcher, Chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors.  “This new campus is a place where young people who want to change their circumstances can receive the encouragement, treatment, education, support, and skills they need to get on a path to a better future.”
Since 2017, Probation has worked with justice partners and community leaders including the Children’s Initiative which played a key role in helping County staff reimagine the future of juvenile detention with a specific focus on how research and data promote more successful outcomes. The design of the facility and the operating approach follows the Youth in Custody Practice Model designed by national experts from Georgetown University’s Center for Juvenile Justice Reform and the Council of Juvenile Justice Administrators.
County officials cut a ceremonial ribbon to open the Youth Transition Center on Jan. 28 in Kearny Mesa.
“Going into the future, the new Youth Transition Campus will emphasize restorative justice, or repairing the harm young people may have caused to their family or in the community. Struggling youth will be provided with trauma-informed rehabilitative and supportive services to complete their high school education, learn life skills, promote pro-social behaviors and prepare them for a successful reentry to the community,” said Interim Chief Probation Officer Cesar Escuro.
The new Youth Transition Campus is a complete transformation of the 1950s-era Juvenile facility and is built across 12 acres on the southern part of the County Juvenile Hall property. Eight housing units that accommodate 96 beds are organized along an arching tree-lined pathway with an open courtyard that includes basketball courts, handball courts, garden space and an amphitheater and stage. Along the other side of the courtyard is the main large visitation and dining building that includes a state-of-the-art culinary arts working kitchen, and a standalone school complex with a career technical education building, and an indoor gymnasium. The residential living units have high wood beam ceilings, large open areas with home-like finishes, and mental health clinicians in each unit.
“This work is part of the County’s larger efforts to ensure at-risk youth are provide evidence-based services and programs, including individual and group counseling, promoting family engagement and providing lived experience mentors,” said Sandra McBrayer, CEO of The Children’s Initiative. “The Youth Transition Center and the accompanying programs will provide youth the skills and tools they need to thrive. It will be a model for the country to implement positive youth development in a therapeutic detention setting.”
The Youth Transition Campus is where youth, ages 13 to 20, will reside after a true finding in juvenile court, and are committed to time in custody. Staff and 12 youth will move in the first week of February with more youth transitioning throughout the month.
This project is a LEED gold certified campus that will save taxpayers money by replacing an aging, facility with a modern, energy-efficient rehabilitative campus.
The Youth Transition Campus project is the first part of two phases in redeveloping the overall juvenile justice campus. The next phase of construction is set to begin in the spring and will include a 72-bed Temporary Residential Placement Facility, previously known as Juvenile Hall, and a small office building to support Probation staff and families.

878,100 Affordable Housing Units Coming to San Marcos,"One hundred more affordable housing units for low-income people and families are coming to San Marcos, thanks to the County and Affirmed Housing.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/100-affordable-housing-units-coming-to-san-marcos/,2022-02-01T11:26:55-08:00,"
One hundred more affordable housing units for low-income people and families are coming to San Marcos, thanks to the County and Affirmed Housing.
A groundbreaking was held today for Alora, a nearly $40 million complex at 604 Richmar Ave. The project includes the demolition of 40 older units which are being replaced by 100 one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments for families earning 30-80% of area median income.
“The loss of affordable units, coupled with the continuously rising rents, is creating housing instability for thousands of San Diegans across the region,”said David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “It is very important, now more than ever, that the County take significant steps to preserve and create affordable housing opportunities throughout the region. And Alora is a significant step in this effort.”
The four, 3-story walk-up buildings will have laundry rooms, a pool, community room, tot lots and 171 parking spaces. Alora is expected to open in summer 2023.

Alora’s funding includes $6.25 million from the County’s Innovative Housing Trust Fund and funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The development will remain affordable in the community of San Marcos for 99 years, ensuring that the residents have an opportunity for safe affordable housing.
The Innovative Housing Trust Fund was established by the County to provide gap financing for developments that create or preserve affordable housing. To date, the $50 million invested in the fund has leveraged $567 million in other public and private funds to create and preserve 1,397 permanent affordable housing units within 20 developments in 15 communities throughout San Diego County. In Aug. 2021, the Board of Supervisors increased funding by $20 million for a total of $70 million.

880,Flu Cases Continue to Decrease in County,"While the number of influenza cases was unusually high last week, the great majority of those are earlier infections that were just reported, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-cases-continue-to-decrease-in-county/,2022-02-02T13:59:37-08:00,"
While the number of influenza cases was unusually high last week, the great majority of those are earlier infections that were just reported, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Of the 170 flu cases reported the week ending Jan. 29, only nine occurred during that seven-day period. The rest are cases from previous weeks that date back to December 2021.
“Fewer San Diegans are getting sick from the flu. However, influenza is unpredictable. People should continue taking precautions, especially getting vaccinated,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It is not too late to get vaccinated, and the vaccine is safe and effective.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending Jan. 29, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 7% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 170 (compared to 28 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,483 (compared to 848 at the same time last season and a 6,614 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 2 (compared to 1 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

881,"COVID-19 Case Reports Down, But Increased Deaths are Reminder to Get Vaccinated, Boosted","New lab-confirmed COVID-19 infections are beginning to decline in the region, but actual case counts may be higher due to the increasing popularity and availability of home antigen tests, results of which are not reported to the County.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-case-reports-down-but-increased-deaths-are-reminder-to-get-vaccinated-boosted/,2022-02-02T18:37:54-08:00,"
New lab-confirmed COVID-19 infections are beginning to decline in the region, but actual case counts may be higher due to the increasing popularity and availability of home antigen tests, results of which are not reported to the County.
In the past week, a total of 29,508 lab-confirmed cases were reported in the region which represents about half of the lab-confirmed COVID-19 cases compared to the week prior when 60,548 COVID-19 lab-confirmed infections were reported.
“It’s important to note that lab-confirmed cases currently only make up a portion of the actual cases in the region, as more and more people rely on home antigen tests,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Virus activity in the region is likely a lot higher than confirmed cases reflect, so people should continue to take precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones.”
New hospitalizations in the region have started to decrease in the past week, indicating that the peak of infections from the Omicron variant wave may have occurred.
Meanwhile, the County is reporting an additional 113 deaths since the last update on Jan. 26, 2022. Since the beginning of the year, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of 225 San Diegans.
“There is a common misconception that the Omicron variant is not as deadly as prior strains of COVID-19,” Wooten said. “The latest data show that since the Omicron variant was first identified, COVID-19 deaths are on the rise, both here in San Diego and across the country. While you can still get COVID-19 despite being vaccinated and boosted, the vaccine keeps most people out of the hospital and reduces the risk of virus-related deaths.”
The region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses. The county has more than 400 vaccination sites including pharmacies, medical providers, clinics, and County locations. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.

883,"“Microbusinesses” Could Receive $2,500 COVID-19 Relief Grants","Microbusinesses across San Diego County hurt by COVID-19 could soon be getting $2,500 boosts after County supervisors approved a grant program Tuesday funded in part by the California Office of the Small Business Advocate.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/microbusinesses-could-receive-2500-covid-19-relief-grants/,2022-02-08T12:19:58-08:00,"
“Microbusinesses” across San Diego County hurt by COVID-19 could soon be getting $2,500 boosts after County supervisors approved a grant program Tuesday funded in part by the California Office of the Small Business Advocate.
Supervisors unanimously approved giving the $2,500 grants to help up to 1,550 microbusinesses, defined as earning less than $50,000 in 2019, being the owner’s primary source of income and having five or fewer employees, currently and in 2019, 2020 and 2021. The list could include home businesses like pet sitters, shoppers, cleaners and home health care workers, and sidewalk vendors like food cart operators.
Applications can be submitted online starting Feb. 15.
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher said even though COVID-19 restrictions and limitations on businesses ended last summer, the grant program would help small businesses that are still feeling the pandemic’s effects.
“There’s always more we can do,” Fletcher said. “So … this small business COVID-19 grant program will help get about $3.8 million out to some of the smallest businesses, often family-run businesses, to help them purchase equipment, invest in working capital, apply for and renew permits, pay off any debts accrued due to the pandemic and offset costs resulting from the pandemic.”
The application page can be reached indirectly through the County’s Microbusiness COVID-19 Relief Grant Program webpage or directly at the Small Business Development Center’s website.
The grants are planned to be distributed equally among the County’s five supervisorial districts, aided by outreach at events, farmer’s markets and libraries, and through community groups and door-to-door canvassing.
State and County officials hope the grants will reach microbusinesses run by those that have historically faced barriers to obtaining capital, including women, minorities, veterans, limited English speakers, businesses in low- to mid-income rural areas and people without documentation.
Microbusinesses may be eligible for the $2,500 grant if their business:

Was started before Dec. 31, 2019, is the owner’s primary source of revenue, and is currently operating or has a plan to reopen
Generated less than $50,000 in revenue in the 2019 tax year
Currently has five or fewer full-time employees and had five or fewer employees in 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Was significantly impacted by COVID-19
Has not previously received any grant money from the California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant Program

The County has contracted with Southwestern College’s Small Business Development Center to collect and process online applications and to conduct outreach along with the Asian Business Association of San Diego, the Logan Heights Community Development Corporation, the South County Economic Development Council and the San Diego East County Economic Development Council.
The County’s grants must be distributed in 2022. The first application process will run from Feb. 15 to 5 p.m. March 31. If there is grant money left after the first round, additional application periods will be held.

Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,509 (compared to 685 at the same time last season and a 7,322 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 2 (compared to 1 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

886,Mask Mandate for Fully Vaccinated People Ends Feb. 15,"Given that COVID-19 Omicron cases and hospitalizations have significantly decreased across the state, including San Diego County, the indoor mask mandate established by the California Department of Public Health nearly two months ago will expire Feb. 15.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/mask-mandate-for-fully-vaccinated-people-ends-feb-15/,2022-02-09T17:02:14-08:00,"
Given that COVID-19 Omicron cases and hospitalizations have significantly decreased across the state, including San Diego County, the indoor mask mandate established by the California Department of Public Health nearly two months ago will expire Feb. 15.
The County follows CDPH’s recommendations; therefore, the mask requirement will also expire locally.
Well-fitted masks will still be required indoors for people who are not fully vaccinated. A person is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or one shot of the Johnson and Johnson immunization.
“People who are not fully vaccinated are more likely to become infected compared to people who have received all the recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, including the booster,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccines are the best protection there is to prevent people from getting seriously ill, ending in the hospital or, worse, dying.”
Masks will still be required in schools and in certain settings regardless of vaccination status.
The County Board of Supervisors voted Feb. 8 to ask CDPH to phase out masking in schools in a “safe and responsible” manner.
On Feb. 7, CDPH announced that “the state is continuing to work with education, public health and community leaders to update masking requirements at schools to adapt to changing conditions and ensure the safety of kids, teachers and staff.”
The County Office of Education is the entity responsible for providing guidance to the county’s 42 school districts.

An independent panel of local doctors participated in a virtual event Wednesday that addressed COVID-19 misinformation brought up by members of the public at the Feb. 8 County Board of Supervisors meeting.
The virtual session was available to the public for live viewing and the two doctors who participated dispelled misleading claims about COVID-19.
The panel was moderated by Dr. Eric McDonald, County chief medical officer and included Dr. Jess Mandel and Dr. Mark Sawyer, both from UC San Diego Health.
Both panelists have worked on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic since the virus was first identified here in San Diego. Their discussion included the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, unfounded claims that unvaccinated patients are treated differently in hospitals than vaccinated patients, concerns over long-term side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, the perceived ineffectiveness of wastewater monitoring, as well as other issues that came up at the Board of Supervisors meeting.
County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency staff regularly track COVID-19 misinformation shared during public comment at the Board of Supervisors meetings.
In August of last year, San Diego County became the first jurisdiction in the nation to declare health misinformation a public health crisis. Others have since followed.
The County has also launched a website to debunk common false claims about COVID-19 and educate people on where to find credible medical information sources.
A video of today’s virtual event is available on the coronavirus-sd.com website.

888,Board Takes Action to Balance Housing and Climate Action,County Supervisors voted this week to take a two-phased approach to implement the state’s Vehicle Miles Traveled law to balance the need for housing with the need to address climate change.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-moves-to-apply-traffic-law-balance-housing-climate-action/,2022-02-10T11:13:49-08:00,"
The County’s Board of Supervisors voted Wednesday to take a two-phased approach to implement the state’s Vehicle Miles Traveled law to balance the need for housing with the need to address climate change.
The first phase will be to firm up within six months the current definitions of “infill” areas in unincorporated communities where housing developments could be built without triggering Vehicle Miles Traveled study and mitigation.
Phase two will be to begin longer-term work to explore “unlocking” vast portions of the unincorporated areas where development could by stymied by Vehicle Miles Traveled requirements.
The state’s Vehicle Miles Traveled law seeks in part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by requiring land use jurisdictions to ask proposed developments how many miles the cars their projects would add to roads will have to drive.
Developments where cars would travel 15% fewer miles than the regional average ― like infill development in urbanized areas near roads, jobs and transit ― can be built without expensive study and mitigation.
Projects where drivers would have to drive more than the regional average would have to pay to study and mitigate. That could make it much more expensive for developers to build in the County’s unincorporated areas, where people typically drive farther to reach jobs and amenities.
On Wednesday, the Board members voted 3-2 to finish identifying infill areas in unincorporated communities that could potentially allow interested developers to build as many as 5,441 homes without Vehicle Miles Traveled study and mitigation.
The Board also voted 3-2 to the longer-range phase, which would start with staff coming back to the Board in four months with a ”sustainable land use framework” that could ultimately lead to an update of the County general plan.
“Adopting a VMT (Vehicle Miles Traveled) policy is not an option,” Board Chair Nathan Fletcher said, “it is the requirement of state law.
“The opportunity in front of us,” he continued, “is to accept that we have to tackle climate change and we have to build housing ― and look for the most legally viable way in which we can put the housing in the right places, meet our climate goals and build more housing than we have ever built before.”

It requires all guns in homes or structures near a home to either be secured with a trigger lock or be locked away in a container. The only exception is if the firearm is within the immediate control of an authorized person.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/safe-gun-storage-ordinance-takes-effect-february-25/,2022-02-11T11:57:20-08:00,"
The County of San Diego ordinance requiring that all guns be safely stored takes effect Feb. 25, 2022. It requires all guns in homes or structures near a home to either be secured with a trigger lock or be locked away in a container. The only exception is if the firearm is within the immediate control of an authorized person.
“Safe firearm storage saves lives and prevents gun violence,” said Nathan Fletcher, Chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “Last year we introduced the measure. Earlier this year the rules were finalized, and now we’re delivering on our promise. The common-sense, safe storage guidelines that go into effect in our unincorporated areas will keep families safe, especially children.”
Acting Sheriff Kelly Martinez said, “Gun locks are an important safety measure that can provide critical time between someone having an impulse and taking action.”
Safe gun storage helps protect San Diegans.

Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows 117 children and teenagers were unintentionally killed with firearms, and more than 1,160 children and teenagers took their own lives by using firearms in the United States in 2019. In that same year, 54 children and teens died by suicide in California due to the use of firearms. Studies have demonstrated the risk of suicide is higher in homes where a firearm is kept loaded or unlocked.
The ordinance applies to all unincorporated areas of San Diego County.
The safe storage of guns was part of an ordinance passed Jan. 25, 2022 that also regulates non-serialized firearms and non-serialized pre-cursor firearm parts commonly known as ghost guns.

891,San Diegans Encouraged to Feel the Beat During ‘Love Your Heart’ Week of Action,The County of San Diego is joining forces with regional officials and community partners to ask San Diegans to check their blood pressure and take a step toward better heart health.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-encouraged-to-feel-the-beat-during-love-your-heart-week-of-action/,2022-02-11T12:16:43-08:00,"
The County of San Diego is joining forces with regional officials and community partners to ask San Diegans to check their blood pressure and take a step toward better heart health. They held a virtual news conference today to promote the Love Your Heart Week of Action, which runs Feb. 12 through Feb. 20.
Now in its 11th year, the Love Your Heart campaign uses the period around Valentine’s Day to encourage people to understand their blood pressure numbers and take steps to prevent hypertension.
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, and hypertension is the most common comorbidity in people who have died from COVID-19 in San Diego County. Death certificates for nearly half of the COVID-19 deaths in the region listed hypertension as an underlying condition.
“The impact of pre-existing heart disease has really come to the forefront in a very significant way during COVID-19,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors. “We have seen that people who are sickest with COVID-19 tend to have underlying health issues, with the most prevalent being high blood pressure.”
High blood pressure is known as the “silent killer” because it may show no symptoms. However, hypertension puts people at an increased risk for heart disease and stroke, two of the top causes of death in the region. More than 4,000 San Diegans die annually from complications of hypertension.
“The older you get, the greater your chances of developing high blood pressure,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Race, physical inactivity, obesity, a family history of hypertension, and smoking also put you at a higher risk of high blood pressure.”
This year, due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the number of sites offering blood pressure screenings will be more limited than in years past, but free educational and interactive heart health events will be available throughout the region and across the border in Mexico.
Select San Diego County Library branches and CVS pharmacy locations are offering onsite blood pressure screenings throughout the Love Your Heart Week of Action. The County and its partners also distributed 1,000 blood pressure monitors to San Diegans in communities where hypertension is most prevalent.
Love Your Heart aligns with Live Well San Diego, the County’s vision for healthy, safe and thriving residents and communities.

892,Got COVID? Get Treatment to Recover Faster,The County Health and Human Services Agency is reminding San Diegans that monoclonal antibody treatment is available for people at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/got-covid-get-treatment-to-recover-faster/,2022-02-15T09:30:01-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reminding San Diegans that monoclonal antibody treatment is available for people at high risk of serious illness from COVID-19.
The first Monoclonal Antibody Regional Center opened in the region just one year ago. Since then, more than 8,100 patients have been treated in ten regional outpatient settings, six of which remain open today. The treatment centers have availability to treat people with sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody that is effective against the Omicron variant.
“Despite the thousands of new COVID-19 cases being reported, we have a lot of capacity for monoclonal antibody treatment,” said Jennifer Tuteur, M.D., County deputy chief medical officer, adding that every eligible San Diegan should get all the recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, including the booster shot.
“Vaccination is the best protection we have against COVID-19, but if people get sick, we want all high-risk people to know they may be eligible for treatment, and there are several options throughout the County to serve them.”
These monoclonal antibody therapies are used to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children 12 years and older.
Monoclonal antibody treatment has proven to significantly reduce hospital visits and death in COVID-19 positive patients, if administered within 10 days of the onset of symptoms.
According to National Institutes of Health researchers, clinical trials showed “an 85% relative reduction…in the risk of hospitalization or death among those who received sotrovimab.” Studies have also shown patients feel better and get back to work faster after receiving monoclonal antibodies.
The treatment is available at no cost regardless of health insurance or immigration status, and a doctor’s referral is not required. The intravenous treatment takes less than an hour.
You may be eligible for treatment if you:

Tested positive for COVID-19; and
Have symptoms of COVID-19, but not for more than 10 days; and
Are at high risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19.

The County has partnered with the California Medical Services Authority and local health care providers to open several of the monoclonal antibody regional centers, or MARCs. In addition, a Mobile Monoclonal Antibody Administration Team provides treatment at skilled nursing facilities across the region. Skilled nursing facilities interested in monoclonal antibody treatment should contact the mobile team at MCSDNursingM_MAT.HHSA@sdcounty.ca.gov.
Patients or providers can call (619) 685-2500 to schedule an appointment. More information is also available at COVIDtreatment@sdcounty.ca.gov

“Microbusinesses” around San Diego County hurt by COVID-19 can now officially begin applying online for $2,500 grants.
The County Board of Supervisors last week approved making 1,550 grants totaling $3.8 million, funded in part by the California Office of the Small Business Advocate, to some of the smallest businesses in the county, like home businesses and sidewalk vendors.
The list could include home businesses like pet sitters, shoppers, cleaners and home health care workers, and sidewalk vendors like food cart operators.
Microbusinesses may be eligible for a $2,500 grant if their business:

Was started before Dec. 31, 2019, is the owner’s primary source of revenue, and is currently operating or has a plan to reopen
Generated less than $50,000 in revenue in the 2019 tax year
Currently has five or fewer full-time employees and had five or fewer employees in 2019, 2020 and 2021
Was significantly impacted by COVID-19
Has not previously received any grant money from the California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant Program

The grants are planned to be distributed equally among the County’s five supervisorial districts, aided by outreach at events, farmer’s markets and libraries, and through community groups and door-to-door canvassing.
State and County officials hope the grants will reach microbusinesses run by those that have historically faced barriers to obtaining capital, including women, minorities, veterans, limited English speakers, businesses in low- to mid-income rural areas and people without documentation.
The grant application page can be reached either through the County’s Microbusiness COVID-19 Relief Grant Program webpage or directly at the Small Business Development Center’s website.
The County has contracted with Southwestern College’s Small Business Development Center to collect and process online applications and to conduct outreach along with the Asian Business Association of San Diego, the Logan Heights Community Development Corporation, the South County Economic Development Council and the San Diego East County Economic Development Council.
The County’s grants must be distributed in 2022. The first application process will run from Feb. 15 to 5 p.m. on March 31. If there is grant money left after the first round, additional application periods will be held.

Earthquakes happen every day in California. Nearly all are so minor they go unnoticed. But one long-range scientific model forecasts a 6.7 magnitude will happen sometime in California in the next 12 years. Yet, the warning for a specific earthquake doesn’t come more than a few seconds ahead. That means the only time to prepare for a significant earthquake is before one happens.
As part of Earthquake Preparedness Month in California, the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services recommends residents have a plan to protect themselves in the event of an earthquake and practice what to do.
“Taking steps to prepare now could reduce injuries and damage to your home and help your household recover in the event of a significant earthquake,” said Jeff Toney, director of the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services. “Many of these suggestions are cost-free and take just minutes to do. It’s important not to put emergency preparedness off.”
Download, the SD Emergency app which now has ShakeReadySD earthquake early warning technology, powered by ShakeAlert®, a product of the U.S. Geological Survey. The ShakeReadySD technology is designed to trigger an alert to your cellphone if you are in a location close enough to an earthquake with a magnitude 4.5 or greater with a shaking intensity of 3 or greater. If an earthquake has occurred nearby that is likely to cause shaking within seconds, the app will urge users to take protective action such as drop, cover and hold on or another appropriate safety measure.

Learn and practice Drop, Cover and Hold On and other safety measures to take during shaking from an earthquake.
Learn what your risk is for an earthquake using this online tool. San Diego County is home to three major active faults: the Rose Canyon Fault (which runs along the coast, through downtown, Old Town and La Jolla), and the San Jacinto and Elsinore faults, which run through the northern and eastern areas of the county. Earthquakes along these faults could produce damaging earthquakes that may disrupt roadways, transportation, and services like water, gas, and phone communication for weeks or months. Coastal areas are also at risk for tsunamis.
Update your personal disaster plan. Templates are available in 12 languages and for people who may need assistance. A mobile version is also part of the SD Emergency app. Discuss with household members to include reunion locations since you may not be with your loved ones when a quake occurs, emergency supplies such as water, non-perishable food, specialized foods for infants, pets, first aid supplies, radios, flashlights, batteries and extra medications.
Register for AlertSanDiego  or AlertaSanDiego, the County’s cellphone notification service. By doing that, you will receive any emergency messages such as evacuation warnings that apply to the area you specify.
At home, people can secure large furniture and electronics to wall studs, move heavy items to lower shelves and install locks or latches on large cabinets.
Make sure you know where the gas valve is located and have a tool to turn it off if needed. Make sure you only turn it off if you smell gas or suspect a gas leak.

“COVID-19 vaccine additional doses and boosters offer protection against the Omicron variant, prevent serious illness in most people and keep people out of the hospital,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diegans should get all the recommended vaccine doses as soon as they are eligible.”
An additional shot is recommended for people ages 5 and up who are moderately and severely immunocompromised. COVID-19 vaccine boosters are available for fully vaccinated people ages 12 and up.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now recommends an additional dose for moderately and severely immunocompromised individuals three months after the primary dose.  For boosters, the CDC recommends people receive a Pfizer or Moderna booster shot five months after their primary series. A Johnson & Johnson booster is recommended two months after the first dose.
Pfizer boosters have been approved for everyone age 12 and older. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson boosters are available only for adults 18 years and older.
An additional dose for immunocompromised people is recommended to be given 28 days after the second dose—Pfizer is available for everyone ages 5 and up and Moderna for just adults 18 and older. Individuals in this category are also eligible for a booster dose 2 or 3 months after their last primary dose depending on the type of vaccine they received initially.
Locally, a total of 1,131,912 or 53.7% of the 2,107,394 San Diegans who are fully vaccinated have received a booster. That means 975,482 are due for a booster.

The Citizens’ Law Enforcement Review Board will host a virtual town hall Feb. 22 on a report recently published by the Center for Policing Equity that looked at practices by the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.
Members of CPE will present an overview of their report and answer questions regarding its findings, and the public can provide comments.
The Sheriff’s Department participated in a National Justice Database Project, in which the CPE independently reviewed the department’s uses of force, traffic stops, and non-traffic stop data from 2016 to 2020.
CPE published the report in December 2021. Among its findings, the report found disparities in how minorities were treated. The Sheriff’s Department issued a response disputing those conclusions and questioned the analysis.
The public is invited to participate in the virtual town hall at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 22 at https://zoom.us/j/92431622262?pwd=WktGMXJMSjlxaGpiaXFLbks1N1NYUT09. No registration is required.

899,East County Man Dies from Influenza,"A 64-year-old man from eastern San Diego County is the third influenza death reported in the region this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/east-county-man-dies-from-influenza/,2022-02-23T11:27:39-08:00,"
A 64-year-old man from eastern San Diego County is the third influenza death reported in the region this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The man died Jan. 7, 2022, had underlying medical conditions and had not been vaccinated against the flu. He did not have COVID-19 at time of death.
“Influenza deaths are very unfortunate. Our condolences go out to the man’s family and friends,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While influenza activity is low this season, you can still catch it, and it can be severe. Everyone six months and older should get a flu vaccine, which is safe and effective.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending Feb. 19, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 2% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 38 (compared to 34 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,581 (compared to 702 at the same time last season and an 8,775 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 3 (compared to 1 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

901,Hundreds of County Employees Volunteer for Homeless Count,The annual homeless count is spearheaded by the Regional Task Force on Homelessness and provides a one-day snapshot of people living on the streets or in short-term shelters.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/hundreds-of-county-employees-volunteer-for-homeless-count/,2022-02-24T13:13:41-08:00,"
It’s around 4 a.m. and it’s cold outside.
On the corner of 30th St. and University Ave. in North Park a man is walking with his bike in tow. He stops to talk to Lisa Lawrence and Christianne Knoop, two County employees with Health and Human Services Agency Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities who are volunteering in the annual homeless count.
He agrees to answer a short questionnaire and gets socks, masks and a $10 gift card to 7-Eleven in return. Starbucks gift cards were also provided.
His name is Rahid. He’s 49, Hispanic and has been homeless for 10 years. He says he does not have any mental illness, but admits he uses methamphetamines.
County social worker Christianne Knoop speaks with a homeless woman.
Why is a Homeless Count Done?
Knoop enters his information into the survey application the Regional Task Force on Homelessness uses to gather information on some of the thousands of people in San Diego County who are homeless.
Knoop and Lawrence don’t have to walk far since Emwar, covered in a comforter, is walking by.
He too agrees to talk to them. He is 34 years old, African American and has been homeless on and off for five years. He too is using substances but says he’s working on getting stable housing.
The annual homeless count is spearheaded by the Regional Task Force on Homelessness and provides a one-day snapshot of people living on the streets or in short-term shelters. The results are used to apply for federal and state funding to help people experiencing homelessness and find solutions on how to best serve this vulnerable population.  In San Diego County, the homeless count is completed annually, but a count did not take place in 2021 due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and this year’s count had to be pushed back for about a month due to the Omicron surge.
This year, about 1,400 people volunteered for the count. Volunteers gathered in different locations throughout the region where they are separated into teams, and they walk or drive the streets, parks, beaches and valleys looking for people who are experiencing homelessness.
The teams deployed from San Diego LGBTQ Center headed out to walk the streets and alleys of Hillcrest, Old Town, Mission Hills, North Park and University Heights.
Some teams drove. Others walked and engaged people they found asking them if they wanted to participate in a survey to better understand their situation.
County Employees Step Up
County employees have participated in the homeless count for the past eight years, earning their regular pay.  This year, more than 300 County employees volunteered for the count.
Knoop and Lawrence’s team also included a freshman student at San Diego State University who aspires to be a social worker when he graduates.
The group was assigned to North Park, particularly the area between University Ave. and El Cajon Blvd. from Arizona St. to Iowa Street.
“It’s important to volunteer for the count,” said Lawrence who has volunteered for five years. She is a Social Worker at the Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities, Office of Homeless Solutions within the Health and Human Services Agency.
“You hear the word homeless, but you really don’t know what it means until you see it,” said Lawrence, adding that she tries to get her friends to volunteer.
Knoop said she has volunteered to do the homeless count four times because she likes to be engaged in her community.
“Everyone has a story to tell and it’s important that we listen,” said Knoop who is also a Social Worker within the Office of Homeless Solutions. “These are real people. It’s hard to comprehend what they’re going through.”
Both Knoop and Lawrence regularly do homeless outreach as part of their job but emphasized importance of participating in the count to learn more about the needs of those experiencing homelessness.
Not every homeless person the teams encounter is interviewed. Some people who were sleeping were not disturbed. In those instances, the counters filled out an even shorter questionnaire, which noted where they were sleeping.
Some, like Mike, Stephanie and Mitchell also agreed to share their experiences.
Mike, who is 58 and White, has been homeless for 10 years. Nearby was Stephanie, a 53-year-old African American woman who has been homeless for the past five years. Both said they have no physical or substance abuse issues.
On an alley near Lincoln Ave. and 30th Street, Knoop and Lawrence came across Mitchell, a 61-year-old veteran who said he’s been homeless for 15 years.
Homeless count volunteers use an app to enter people’s information.
Lawrence looked him up in the Homeless Management Information System and found that Mitchell had received services in the past from PATH, a local organization that provides services to people experiencing homelessness. His contact information was outdated, so Lawrence took his phone number down to ensure he can be again connected to housing resources and supports.
During the 2020 count, the region’s combined total of people experiencing homelessness came to 7,638, a 6% drop compared to 2019.  Of those, 3,971 were unsheltered. These individuals included veterans, family members, victims of domestic violence, those with substance user disorders, HIV/AIDS patients and the chronically homeless.
Homeless advocates believe that the COVID-19 pandemic has displaced many more people over the past two years. They will have more information when the results of this year’s homeless count are available in the spring.
The County has multiple programs in place that could connect homeless people to the services they need and help them find a stable place to live. You can find more information here or by calling 2-1-1.

Community input is needed on the County’s Alternatives to Incarceration project. The County has launched a year-long study to improve the justice system, working with an independent contractor, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG). SANDAG is taking applications for an Advisory Group to provide community and stakeholder input.
The Alternatives to Incarceration project will review the input and data to inform recommendations to safely reduce jail populations. The recommendations will also focus on better protecting residents by improving and expanding rehabilitative treatment and services while advancing equity. The project recognizes incarceration can disproportionately impact the poor, homeless, mentally ill, and people of color.
The Advisory Group will meet monthly for a year to conduct a review of jail and law enforcement data, research best practices for diverting individuals from custody who can be served in community-based settings rather than jails, and identify gaps in treatments, facilities, and programs.
Those encouraged to apply include: community members who represent diverse perspectives and experiences, including incarcerated and formerly incarcerated individuals; local community-based-reentry, alternatives to incarceration, and recidivism experts (housing, substance use, reentry, mental and behavioral health, veteran services, domestic violence, etc.); and criminal justice reform advocates. Applications are due on Tuesday, March 15, 2022 at 5 p.m..

903,County Opens Applications for Mini Home-Kitchen Restaurants,The first aspiring chefs looking to turn their homes or apartments into mini-restaurants gathered at the County Operations Center as the County officially opened its application process for “Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations.”,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-opens-applications-for-mini-home-kitchen-restaurants/,2022-02-25T13:46:31-08:00,"
The first aspiring chefs looking to turn their homes or apartments into mini-restaurants gathered at the County Operations Center Friday as the County officially opened its application process for “Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations.”
County supervisors unanimously approved a two-year, temporary authorization in January to let people countywide operate mini-restaurants out of their homes serving up to 30 in-person, take-out or delivery meals a day, with a maximum of 60 a week.
On Friday, County Department of Environmental Health and Quality staff and members of the San Diego Microenterprise Home Kitchen Operations (MEHKO) Coalition greeted a couple dozen people to help them navigate the application process and answer questions. The department has also created a website where people can apply and get information.
Home cooks who want to operate a microenterprise kitchen will be required to submit an application, earn a food safety manager certificate from an approved school, pass an initial inspection, and undergo annual inspections. Kitchens that rely upon well water would also have to conduct private well tests to ensure the water is safe.
The state moved to allow microenterprise kitchens in 2019 with restrictions. Some of those include:

They must be operated by a resident living in the home or apartment
They cannot have more than one full-time employee, excluding family members.
Food must be prepared and served on the same day and sold directly to consumers.
They’re limited to $50,000 in sales a year.
They cannot operate as caterers, temporary event vendors, mobile event vendors or cottage food operators that prepare and sell packaged foods.

The County is the regional local authority that conducts health inspections for all restaurants and food facilities countywide and is the governing body to consider MEHKO authorization for the unincorporated areas and the county’s 18 cities.
County Board Vice Chair Nora Vargas and Supervisor Joel Anderson asked the Board to approve a microenterprise home kitchen operation ordinance. When the Board approved the ordinance last month, they said the kitchens would not compete with established restaurants but would help local communities, the economy and people with cooking skills trying to make ends meet.
County staff said comments collected in public meetings and hearings also stated that home-kitchen restaurants had numerous potential economic and community benefits. For example, they would give aspiring restaurateurs a way to earn a living and way to test their skills and ideas for an overall startup cost of about $740, rather than spending the estimated $275,000 average cost of opening a storefront restaurant. They would also provide “food justice” and healthy, home-cooked meals for communities that don’t have lots of restaurants or that lack access to healthy food.
County staff plan to study local home-kitchen restaurants during the two-year temporary authorization of the ordinance and bring that data back to the Board before the ordinance expires for supervisors to consider whether to make it permanent.

The Medical Examiner’s Office needs your help identifying a man killed while crossing Interstate 805 in January.
No identification or personal property was found by medical crews who took him to the hospital. An artist sketch of the man was made of the man and a tattoo on his arm.
Witnesses to the accident say the man ran across northbound I-805 at the Interstate 8 interchange in Mission Valley and was hit by a vehicle on Jan. 12. Motorists called 9-1-1 and he was taken to a hospital where he died Jan. 18.
Medical Examiner’s Office investigators said the man is a Caucasian male that appears to be in his early 20s. He is approximately 5 feet 5 inches tall and weighs 135 pounds with short brown hair, and brown eyes. He was unshaven at the time of his death. A fingerprint search with FBI, state, and local agencies did not result in a match.
Anyone who may recognize the man is asked to please contact the Medical Examiner’s Office Investigations Division at 858-694-2905 regarding Case 2022-00253.

The Registrar of Voters has mailed over 1.9 million postcards to registered voters in San Diego County informing them of their voting options for the June 7, 2022 Gubernatorial Primary Election.
This will be the first countywide election conducted under the Voter’s Choice Act. Under the act, every active registered voter will automatically receive a ballot in the mail and will have three options for returning that ballot: by mail, to one of the Registrar’s secure ballot drop box locations, or at any vote center in the county. Ballots will start going out in the mail the week of May 9, giving voters nearly a month to mark their ballot and return it before Election Day.
Voters also have the choice to vote in-person at any one of over 200 vote centers located across the county, which will be open over multiple days. Elections are no longer a one-day event, and there is no need to wait until Election Day to vote.
The concept won’t be entirely new to San Diego County voters. The Registrar’s office used a similar format for the November 2020 presidential general and September 2021 gubernatorial recall elections.
The Registrar’s office anticipates opening approximately 130 ballot drop box locations starting May 9. Over 200 vote centers will open for four days starting June 4. Nearly 40 of those vote centers will open earlier, May 28, giving voters 11 days to cast their ballots.
A list of ballot drop box and vote center locations will be available by April 1 at sdvote.com.

County of San Diego officials and community partners today announced early results and the launch of a broad, public awareness campaign for a program providing a specialized response to people experiencing a mental health, drug or alcohol-related crisis.
Since the Mobile Crisis Response Teams began services in January 2021, the non-law enforcement program has responded to 672 referrals and successfully linked over 110 people to treatment services. Forty-seven percent of referrals have resulted in people being able to access treatment in their community, without the need for law enforcement or more acute services. Of those MCRT has served, approximately 20% were experiencing homelessness.
“Mobile Crisis Response Teams are working. Nearly 700 referrals for behavioral health services have resulted in better outcomes for individuals experiencing a behavioral health crisis,” said Nathan Fletcher, chair of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “Mobile Crisis Response Teams change a person’s entry point into the health care system and change their trajectory moving forward. Over time, we want to reduce the number of people who get to a state of crisis, and the way you do that is by engaging people in community care and other services.”
Rolled out throughout February, the countywide public awareness campaign includes print, radio, digital and billboard ads, in English and Spanish, encouraging people to call the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 if they or someone they know is having a nonviolent behavioral health crisis.
Billboards like this one can be seen on freeways and streets throughout the region.
Following the initial round of the MCRT campaign, a second phase of public messaging will provide more focused messaging, photos and engagement tailored to underserved populations.
“These response teams are saving lives, demonstrating that this new approach to mental health is showing signs of real progress,” said Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer. “San Diego, we need your help to get the word out. You can call the Access and Crisis Hotline at 888-724-7240 when someone is experiencing a mental health or substance use emergency that does not involve threats of violence. Remember this phone number, because it can change someone’s life.”
What Are MCRTs?
Mobile Crisis Response Teams, or MCRTs, are available countywide for people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis. The teams are comprised of licensed mental health clinicians, case managers and peer support specialists who travel to the person to provide assessment, crisis intervention services and connections to treatment and other services, as needed. The training, compassion and resources these teams bring with them on every call is proving to be a winning combination.
MCRTs partner with Chula Vista and National City police departments, which refer calls to MCRT when appropriate. The County is also working with nine other jurisdictions to establish similar partnerships.
“Innovative community-based interventions are critically important to meeting people where they are with the right response, thereby advancing our vision to provide an equitable and regional distribution of services,” Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services division at the County Health and Human Services Agency, said at a news conference announcing the campaign and the early results. “MCRTs are an excellent example of innovative services, but they are not the only one.”
In the past few years, the County has made significant increases in investment and funding to provide better access to behavioral health services.
Throughout 2021, the County significantly expanded capacity of crisis stabilization units for people experiencing a behavioral health crisis, providing much needed support to individuals who may otherwise end up at a local emergency room or jail.
The units provide services in a community-based or hospital setting for people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis.
Services are provided on a walk-in basis with stays of less than 24 hours. In addition to walk-in, community and mobile crisis team transport, law enforcement may drop off people experiencing a behavioral health crisis to the stabilization units as a safe alternative to jail or a hospital, allowing officers more options to connect people to care.
Crisis stabilization units are designed to enable the smoothest transition possible from law enforcement engagement to care hand-off. The system is less taxing on individuals, allows officers to return quickly to the field and provides a care plan leading to less recidivism.
County Conducting Community Outreach
To complement the public awareness campaign, the County has also begun a community-based outreach and engagement effort through a contract with Jewish Family Service’s Breaking Down Barriers program. The Breaking Down Barriers program is a prevention and early intervention program providing outreach and education to reduce stigma around mental illness through trusted community partners.
The program will engage new outreach workers and work with community organizations to connect to diverse communities and provide information about how to access services when there is a need. The plan is to reach about 1,000 community members each month through outreach events, presentations, community conversations, flyer dissemination, posters placed in community locations, outreach to local businesses and social marketing.
If you or someone you know is experiencing a behavioral health crisis, call the Access & Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240.

908,Board Votes to Turn Three County Properties into Affordable Housing,The Board of Supervisors today voted to designate three vacant County properties as excess property and to request proposals so that they can be developed into affordable housing.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-votes-to-turn-three-county-properties-into-affordable-housing/,2022-03-01T14:18:59-08:00,"
The Board of Supervisors today voted to designate three vacant County properties as excess property and to request proposals so that they can be developed into affordable housing.
Two properties are in the City of San Diego. One is the former Northeast Family Resource Center, located at 5001 73rd Street in the College Area. The 1.26-acre property has been vacated by the County Health and Human Services Agency and includes a 22,000-square-foot building that will be demolished in late 2022.
The second property is located at 6255 Mission Gorge Road in the Grantville area. The land includes a 23,385-square-foot building on 0.86 acres that will also be demolished in late 2022, as well as a separate 18,731-square-foot parking lot across Glacier Ave. to the northeast.
The third property is in Escondido, located at 600-620 E. Valley Parkway, and includes 1.88 acres of vacant land that used to be the home of the North Inland Family Resource Center.
By demolishing and clearing the existing structures at the sites in the City of San Diego, at a cost of about $1.29 million, the properties could then be turned over to selected developers in a clean condition and will help expedite the development process for a financially feasible development.
The development of these properties is part of the County’s ongoing efforts to increase the number of affordable housing units in the region. Additional County affordable housing efforts includes the availability of No Place Like Home funding, Permanent Local Housing Allocation as well as recent efforts related to Project Based Housing Vouchers and the Innovative Housing Trust Fund.
In 2017, the County established the Innovative Housing Trust Fund to provide gap financing for developments that create or preserve affordable housing. To date, the $50 million invested in the fund has leveraged $567 million in other public and private funds to create and preserve 1,397 permanent affordable housing units within 20 developments in 15 communities throughout San Diego County. In Aug. 2021, the Board of Supervisors increased funding by $20 million for a total of $70 million.
According to the most recent Cycle Regional Housing Needs Assessment, about 68,959 affordable housing units are needed regionally for very low and low-income people and households.
All units reserved for low-income individuals and households serve tenant populations earning below 80% area median income, currently $67,900 for a one-person household and $97,000 for a four-person household, with many of the homes reserved for those earning far less.

909,"Parents Urged to Get Tweens, Teens Caught Up on Vaccinations","Feb. 27 through March 5, 2022 is Preteen Vaccine Week, and County health officials say this is the ideal time for parents to catch up and make sure their children get all the recommended vaccines.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/parents-urged-to-get-tweens-teens-caught-up-on-vaccinations/,2022-03-02T10:48:37-08:00,"
One can prevent a bacterial illness that can cause infections of the lining of the brain, spinal cord and bloodstream. Another can protect against several viruses that cause cancer.
They are vaccines for meningococcal disease and human papillomavirus (HPV), and are two of five immunizations recommended for preteens and adolescents. The other three vaccines offer protection against whooping cough, chickenpox and influenza.
Feb. 27 through March 5, 2022 is Preteen Vaccine Week, and County health officials say this is the ideal time for parents to catch up and make sure their children get all the recommended vaccines.
“When preteens are vaccinated, they can safely enjoy sports, after-school activities and in-person learning,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Also, certain vaccines are required to attend public or private schools in California. Parents should make sure their children have gotten all the recommended vaccines to protect them from getting sick.”
Making sure students have all the required vaccines is part of the countywide Live Well San Diego vision, an effort to improve the health and well-being of residents in the region. Staying up to date on recommended vaccinations, including the series for COVID-19,  is key to prevent or reduce the severity of infectious diseases.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends adolescent children get immunized against the following diseases:

HPV
Boys and girls need all shots in the series for full protection. HPV vaccine for girls and young women prevents cervical cancer, but the vaccine is also recommended for boys to prevent anal cancer and genital warts.
Meningococcal disease
The vaccine protects against meningococcal bacteria, which are known to cause serious illness. The bacteria can infect the blood and cause inflammation of the tissues covering the brain and the spinal cord. Ten percent of teens who become ill die, and another 15% suffer long-term disability such as loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems or brain damage.
Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (grouped in one vaccine called Tdap)
All students entering 7th grade need proof of a Tdap booster in order to attend school.
Influenza
The flu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months and older. Even though influenza activity has been very mild this season, other seasons have been more severe. Everyone 6 months and older should get a flu shot.
Chickenpox
Chickenpox, or varicella, is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. While chickenpox is a mild disease for most people, it can be life-threatening for some. Two doses are recommended.

The above vaccines are available at physician offices, community clinics and many retail pharmacies. For updates about COVID-19 vaccine requirements for schools in California, visit Shots for School. People without medical insurance can get vaccinated at one of six County locations; call 211 for a location nearest you.

The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 31 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the San Diego region for the week. That’s three fewer cases than the prior week.
No additional deaths were reported for the period ending Feb. 26. So far this season, there have been three influenza deaths, a slight uptick compared to last year when two flu deaths were reported.
“While influenza activity is lower this season than in many previous years, the flu can cause severe illness and death,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Help prevent the spread of influenza and get vaccinated.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending Feb. 26, 2022:

Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 3 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

A panel of doctors participated in a virtual event Thursday that addressed COVID-19 misinformation brought up by members of the public at the March 1 County Board of Supervisors meeting.
The virtual session was available to the public for live viewing and included simultaneous translation to Spanish. The two doctors who participated dispelled misleading claims about COVID-19.
The panel was moderated by Dr. Eric McDonald, County chief medical officer and included Dr. Christian Ramers from Family Health Centers of San Diego and Dr. Kelly Motadel, County child health officer.
The discussion included effective treatment and preventive measures, information about which masks are effective with the current strains of the virus, who should be seeking monoclonal antibody treatment if they test positive for COVID-19, the burden of the pandemic on immunocompromised San Diegans, as well as other issues that came up at the Board of Supervisors meeting.
County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency staff regularly track COVID-19 misinformation shared during public comment at the Board of Supervisors meetings.
In August of last year, San Diego County became the first jurisdiction in the nation to declare health misinformation a public health crisis. Others have since followed.
The County has also launched a website to debunk common false claims about COVID-19 and educate people on where to find credible medical information sources.
A video of today’s virtual event is available on the coronavirus-sd.com website.

Today, the County officially began demolishing three excess properties that will be developed into affordable housing.
By demolishing and clearing the existing structures, the properties could then be turned over to selected developers in a clean condition and will help expedite the development process for a financially feasible development.
The development of these properties—two in San Diego and one in Escondido—is part of the County’s ongoing efforts to increase the number of affordable housing units in the region.
In 2017, the County established the Innovative Housing Trust Fund to provide gap financing for developments that create or preserve affordable housing. To date, the $50 million invested in the fund has leveraged $567 million in other public and private funds to create and preserve 1,397 permanent affordable housing units within 20 developments in 15 communities throughout San Diego County. In Aug. 2021, the Board of Supervisors increased funding by $20 million for a total of $70 million.

915,County Fire Upgrades Two Mountain Fire Stations,"San Diego County and CAL FIRE recently completed significant improvements to two fire stations, increasing their ability to safeguard communities in the northernmost reaches of the county.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-fire-upgrades-two-mountain-fire-stations/,2022-03-08T11:39:54-08:00,"
San Diego County and CAL FIRE recently completed significant improvements to two fire stations, increasing their ability to safeguard communities in the northernmost reaches of the county.
A new County Fire Station 79 opened with new living quarters for firefighters serving Palomar Mountain. The $4 million project includes new sleeping quarters, a kitchen and dining room, a dayroom and laundry room.
The cabin-style building will replace use of a home built on the property in the 1930s. The modern building has exposed wood columns and beams, a stone veneer and a covered patio overlooking the beautiful mountain landscape.
“The County of San Diego is committed to improving fire protection in our region. We have been fortunate to avoid major wildfires over the past few years, but we know risk in this region is constant,” said County Supervisor Jim Desmond. “These new fire stations will provide resources with up-to-date equipment and stronger staffing levels, which will enable our public safety officials to halt the forward rate of spread to the more populated areas as well as being an integral part of our unincorporated communities.”
This sign leads into the San Diego County Fire Palomar Station 79 property.
“We want to provide the community and our firefighters first-class equipment and facilities for the highest level of service to residents and visitors,” said San Diego County Fire Director Jeff Collins. “We are grateful for the investments made by San Diego County at Fire Station 79.”
CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire Chief Tony Mecham sees the benefits for fire crews.
“These fire stations are staffed 24/7 with professional firefighters, responding to all types of emergencies,” Mecham said. ”The communities we serve become a second home for these men and women, who are on duty days – and sometimes weeks – at a time. We want to provide them safe living quarters as they work to protect San Diego County.”
The new construction allows for the existing space to be updated and turned back over to the community for use by neighbors in the area.
Construction at the remote site created special challenges for contractors working at the site. Crews had to excavate 13 feet into the mountain to create a proper foundation. Workers also had to work through COVID-19 supply chain material shortages and the cold, snowy weather that is present at the highest elevation in San Diego County.
“Platt Whitelaw Architects and EC Constructors delivered a spectacular building which complements the mountain aesthetic,” said General Services Director Marko Medved. “We are replacing a building that served the Palomar Mountain community for more than 90 years and we want crews to serve neighbors from this new building for 90 more.”
Crews also renovated one of San Diego County’s most remote fire stations at Sunshine Summit, along state Route 79 north of Warner Springs.  At this site, crews added 900 square feet to the vehicle bay to allow for the addition of a water tender to CAL FIRE Station 59.
This is San Diego County Fire Sunshine Summit Station 59.
This $2 million project adds much needed space to the small site, a 5,000-gallon water tank with pump to fill trucks, and a new exhaust system to keep the bay free of harmful exhaust fumes.
Construction at the site was done by EC Constructors, and Davy Architects redesigned the Sunshine Summit site.

916,Fourth Influenza Death Reported in San Diego County,"An 87-year-old woman from southern San Diego is the fourth County resident who has died from influenza this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/fourth-influenza-death-reported-in-san-diego-county/,2022-03-09T11:41:39-08:00,"
An 87-year-old woman from southern San Diego is the fourth County resident who has died from influenza this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The woman died on March 1, had underlying medical conditions and had not been vaccinated against the flu. She did not have COVID-19 at the time she died.
“While this flu season is relatively mild compared to many previous years, influenza-related deaths have already doubled from last season,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It is not too late to get a flu shot and protect yourself and your loved ones. The flu vaccine is safe and effective and is recommended for everyone six months and older.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending March 5, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 2% of all visits (compared with 2% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 53 (compared to 29 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,657 (compared to 718 at the same time last season and a 9,809 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

917,County Moves to Prioritized COVID-19 Case Investigations,The County is following the national recommendation to reprioritize COVID-19 case investigations to focus on cases reported in people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications from the disease.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-moves-to-prioritized-covid-19-case-investigations/,2022-03-09T17:56:21-08:00,"
The County is following the national recommendation to reprioritize COVID-19 case investigations to focus on cases reported in people who are at higher risk of developing serious complications from the disease.
COVID-19 case investigations are now limited to people 65 years of age and older, as well as those in congregate living facilities where the virus can spread at a faster rate. The County will no longer be contact tracing all individuals, but will continue to support high-risk settings and outbreak responses.
“COVID-19 vaccines are now widely available, and the majority of the local population is now more protected because they have received all the recommended doses,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Therefore, our efforts are now directed at high-risk people or individuals who reside in congregate settings, such as nursing homes, jails and homeless shelters, and in guiding them to care and treatment.”
The more focused approach began late last week and aligns with new recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is no longer recommending case investigation and contact tracing of every new case of COVID-19.
The change will result in fewer case investigations and contact tracing since the new target populations only represent about 10% of the total number of cases being reported.
“Widespread vaccinations of most age groups, increased use of rapid antigen tests, and the emergence of more-transmissible variants with short incubation periods allowed for the reprioritization of case investigations and contact tracing,” Wooten said.
COVID-19 Data Changes

The Registrar of Voters is seeking temporary election workers for the June 7, 2022 Gubernatorial Primary Election. Election workers can earn up to $20 an hour depending on the position.
There is a particular need for election workers to manage the operations of ballot drop box locations and site managers for vote centers around the county.
Ballot drop box locations will be open for nearly a month and vote centers will be open for up to 11 days instead of one. The Registrar’s office will hire election workers rather than use volunteer poll workers because training is more extensive for the expanded time period.
The Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership and customer service skills and display flexibility, patience, and the highest level of integrity at all times. Election workers must represent the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner.
English speakers who are bilingual in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese or Chinese are also needed. If you are fluent in one of these languages, be sure to indicate it on your application.
The Registrar’s office is working with Public Health Services to ensure the health and safety of election workers and voters. Recommended personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies will be provided to workers so they can conduct the election process safely.
Applications are available online. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.

Three applicants for Interim San Diego County Sheriff appeared before the Board of Supervisors Tuesday and answered questions about leading the law enforcement agency and its 4,300 employees.
Supervisors heard from applicants Michael Barletta, Edwin Brock, and Anthony Ray. The Board then voted to move all the applicants forward to the finalist process. The Board will hear again from the finalists and make an appointment at a Special Meeting on March 22 at 9 a.m.
Due to the early retirement of former Sheriff William Gore, who had served as Sheriff since 2009, the Board is appointing an Interim Sheriff to complete the current term. In November 2022, voters will elect a successor who will take office in January 2023.
None of the applicants considered for appointment are candidates for Sheriff in the upcoming election.
Ray is an Assistant Sheriff who began his career with the department in 1991 serving for more than 30 years. He collaterally is assigned as a co-director for the San Diego County Regional Leadership Institute.
Barletta is a former San Diego County Sheriff’s Department commander who retired in 2015 after serving more than 29 years. He currently works for the Anti-Defamation League as a private contractor teaching law enforcement officers.
Brock is a former San Diego County Sheriff’s lieutenant who retired after more than 30 years of service. He currently serves as police chief in Arvin, California.
Initially, there were four applicants, but Sheriff’s Commander Hank Turner withdrew his name from consideration due to another job offer.

921,Influenza Cases Increasing in San Diego County,"While influenza activity continues to be mild in the region this season, there has been an increase in cases over the past two weeks, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/influenza-cases-increasing-in-san-diego-county/,2022-03-16T10:31:54-07:00,"
While influenza activity continues to be mild in the region this season, there has been an increase in cases over the past two weeks, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Sixty lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in San Diego County the week ending March 12, up three from the 57 infections reported the week before and 29 more than the 31 cases reported the week prior.
A total of 1,721 flu cases were reported through March 12, more than double the 722 that had been reported at the same time last year. The past two influenza seasons have been much milder than the prior five-year average when 10,240 cases had been reported at this time.
“This season, we’re seeing more San Diegans get sick from influenza compared to last year which was an even milder flu season. However, people should continue taking precautions to avoid getting and spreading influenza,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diegans should get a flu shot, wash their hands regularly and stay home when sick.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending March 12, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 2% of all visits (compared with 2% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 60 (compared to 57 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,721 (compared to 722 at the same time last season and a 10,240 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

923,Supervisors Hear Decarbonization Workforce Study Update,"County supervisors received an update Wednesday on their draft Regional Decarbonization Framework and its newest addition, a draft study of opportunities and challenges facing the local workforce resulting from climate action.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/supervisors-hear-decarbonization-workforce-study-update/,2022-03-16T17:25:08-07:00,"
County supervisors received an update Wednesday on their draft Regional Decarbonization Framework and its newest addition, a draft study of opportunities and challenges facing the local workforce resulting from climate action.
“Putting San Diego County on the High Road, Climate Workforce Recommendations for 2030 and 2050” is part of the larger three-pronged decarbonization framework that is expected to be completed and brought to the Board for consideration in August.
The framework also includes a science-based, data-driven technical report that outlines how the entire region could move toward zero-carbon emissions by 2045. That includes a section by the University of San Diego’s Energy Policy Initiatives Center that analyzed 17 regional climate action plan commitments to identify what else the region needs to do to reach the zero-carbon goal in an equitable manner. The third part of the framework will be the collaborative development of workable policies among area cities; environmental, business and labor groups; community members; technical consultants and the County.
County officials are encouraging people to review and comment on the draft Regional Decarbonization Framework and its various reports online through May 31.
At Wednesday’s meeting, authors of the draft workforce study said decarbonization would create high-quality jobs and increase equitable access to them, but would require intentional policies and strategic capital investments.
Supervisors directed County staff in July 2021 to conduct a comprehensive green jobs plan to address the local available opportunities created by climate investments and career paths for workers affected by decarbonization.
Carol Zabin of Inclusive Economics and director of UC Berkeley Labor Center’s Green Economy program is author of both the state’s Jobs and Climate Action Plan for 2030 and the framework’s workforce study. She said Wednesday that good jobs are those that among other things, pay enough to support a family, have career pathways and allow workers to organize.
Some of the workforce study’s specific findings included:

Regional decarbonization pathways would generate an average of nearly 27,000 jobs per year in the San Diego region between 2021 and 2030.
No local workers in fossil fuel-based industries would face losing jobs to decarbonization before 2030, even taking into account industry contraction.
San Diego County and local governments should convene a “just transition task force” that includes government, business and labor to start developing a viable set of just transition policies for the workers in the community who will experience job displacement between 2031 and 2050.
The costs of a just transition will be much lower if the transition is able to proceed steadily rather than through a series of episodes. Under a steady transition, the proportion of workers who will retire voluntarily in any given year will be predictable, and the transition process avoids having to provide support for a much larger share of workers.

County, city and state officials celebrated the grand opening today of a new supportive housing community for older adults who have experienced homelessness. Ivy Senior Apartments, located on Mt. Alifan Drive in Clairemont, opened 53 units for low-income, chronically ill seniors who have experienced homelessness. This permanent, supportive housing offers a stable environment with on- and off-site medical and essential services through PATH, St. Paul’s PACE and Alpha Project.
The Ivy building was intentionally designed with senior-friendly features, including wide hallways that comfortably accommodate two wheelchairs passing each other, distinct color palettes on each floor for wayfinding, valet service for trash, roll-in/walk-in showers, and grab bars in all bathrooms.
Many older adults find themselves struggling to stay sheltered due to the high cost of living, major illness or even the loss of a spouse. They are alone and vulnerable. One in every four people who experiences homelessness in San Diego is 55 years or older and that number is expected to rise at the Baby Boomer generation ages.
Ivy Senior Apartments is the 20th completed development HHSA has helped fund through the Mental Health Services Act. Altogether, the Board of Supervisors has dedicated more than $53 million to create supportive housing for persons with a serious mental illness who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness. Currently, 12 additional projects are under construction that will add another 880 affordable housing units to our local communities.

Interim Sheriff Anthony Ray
Ray will be sworn in on April 5. He is currently an assistant sheriff and has served more than 30 years in the department. He will oversee one of the largest sheriff’s departments in the nation, managing nearly 4,700 employees and providing primary law enforcement to nearly one million people.
The Board first interviewed the three applicants, Ray, Michael Barletta and Edwin Brock on March 15 and invited them back Tuesday for a final round of questions. At the conclusion, the Board members made their choice by vote and the results were then immediately read and entered into the record.
The public applicant interviews and selection process occurred after former Sheriff William Gore, who served as sheriff from 2009 until Feb. 3, retired with 10 months left in the current term.
In November 2022, voters will elect a successor who will take office in January 2023.
Neither Ray nor the other two applicants who were considered for the job are vying for the permanent role in this election.
The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department provides patrol and investigative operations, air support, search and rescue service and forensic support for the San Diego region. The department operates seven detention facilities countywide and provides security to seven courthouses.

931,County Agriculture Detector Dog Honored at His Retirement,"After four years of service protecting the region’s agriculture industry, Podder is going to be sniffing out the life of leisure.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-agriculture-detector-dog-honored-at-his-retirement/,2022-03-23T15:23:11-07:00,"
After four years of service protecting the region’s agriculture industry, Podder is going to be sniffing out the life of leisure.
The detector dog has retired from his work with the County’s Agriculture, Weights & Measures Department. On Wednesday, County staff organized a small ceremony at the Waterfront Park to acknowledge Podder’s work. His former colleague, Yeti, the County’s other detector dog, and Venus, a retired detector dog, and other officials attended to give him a pat on the back, a scratch on the head, and lots of treats and toys.
“In honor of Podder’s service, I’d like to present this Service Award for four years of County service,” said Ha Dang, commissioner/sealer for Agriculture, Weights and Measures.

The Labrador and beagle mix has worked with his handler Kyle Moranton to intercept unmarked agricultural parcels that are shipped in violation of agricultural quarantine, or contain unwanted plant pests including insects, diseases, and other harmful organisms to agriculture.
“He has a great nose,” Moranton said. “I’m going to miss him.”
Only 6 years old, Podder is retiring due to a medical condition. He has since been adopted and is happy, Moranton said.
The California Department of Food and Agriculture Detector Dog Team program began in 2009. The dogs sniff and identify unmarked parcels, which are a high-risk pathway for significant pests to enter the states. Dog teams conduct inspections at parcel facilities such as UPS, FedEx, and the U.S. Postal Service. Dogs are trained to alert on packages that contain agricultural material such as plants, cuttings, fruits, vegetables, seeds, and soil. Those packages are then opened and checked for insects, diseases, or quarantines.
Podder made 426 visits to parcel facilities, where he found 728 plants in unmarked parcels, including 137 rated insect pests capable of causing serious harm to agriculture or were questionable, Moranton said.
Another San Diego County agriculture inspector is now training to become a dog handler and will join the department in the summer with a new detector dog.

934,Artists Invited to Shape Creative Vision For Southeastern Live Well Center,"Local artists are invited to participate in shaping the creative vision for the new Southeastern Live Well Center, which will serve as a hub for County and community services.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/artists-invited-to-shape-creative-vision-for-southeastern-live-well-center/,2022-03-25T14:00:20-07:00,"
Local artists are invited to participate in shaping the creative vision for the new Southeastern Live Well Center, which will serve as a hub for County and community services. The County is looking for submissions from visual and multimedia artists and will commission artwork for numerous spaces in and around the new center.
Once the artist proposals are received, the Southeastern San Diego Live Well Center Public Art Advisory Committee will be instrumental in advising on artist selection for the commissioned artwork. The Advisory Committee includes community residents and leaders from local grassroot organizations – with members representing various social, ethnic and cultural backgrounds in Southeastern San Diego.
The selected art will be placed in the outdoor main entry plaza, meditation garden, corridors, waiting and conference rooms, and family play area of the 65,000-square-foot center.
Art at the Southeastern Live Well Center will represent and celebrate the history, diversity and cross-cultural experiences of the community while educating, creating beauty, inspiration and healing.
“Like many others, I’m really looking forward to seeing the art that results from the proposals,” said Barbara Jiménez, the County’s community operations officer who has been involved with this project for more than a decade. “This is an especially exciting part of the County’s commitment to community engagement for our newest Live Well Center.”
The County broke ground on the project at the corner of Market Street and Euclid Avenue in October of 2021. Construction is on schedule to be completed by next summer.
Once completed, the Southeastern Live Well Center will serve the community with a variety of services, including medical insurance coverage, food and nutrition assistance, family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans’ services. A short walk from a trolley station, the Center will feature shared space for community meetings.
Artist proposals are due at 11:59 p.m. on April 25 and should reflect the County’s commitment to a healthy, safe and thriving region. For more information and to apply, visit the website for art consultant Leah Goodwin Creations. Questions should be directed to goodwin.leah@gmail.com.

938,Flu Cases Continue to Increase,"The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 121 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region, bringing the total case count for this season to 1,941.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208084,2022-03-30T13:54:26-07:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 121 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region, bringing the total case count for this season to 1,941.
This more than doubles the cases reported at this time last season, when 736 lab-confirmed influenza cases had been recorded in the County. In comparison, the prior five-year average was 11,014 cases by the same week.
“Cases of influenza have started to increase over the last several weeks, a trend we attribute to fewer people using face coverings once most masking mandates ended in California,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It is not too late to get vaccinated against the flu and protect ourselves and others from getting sick.”
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending March 26, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 121 (compared to 95 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 1,941 (compared to 736 at the same time last season and a 11,014 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

How to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

939,One Million San Diegans Missing First Booster; Fourth Dose Now Available for 50 and Up,"Close to 1 million San Diegans qualify now for the COVID-19 vaccine booster, yet have still not received their dose, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208088,2022-03-30T16:11:49-07:00,"
Close to 1 million San Diegans qualify now for the COVID-19 vaccine booster, yet have still not received their dose, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Of the 2,182,257 San Diegans eligible, 969,219 remain unboosted, prompting County health officials to remind them that having all the recommended vaccines can prevent getting and spreading COVID-19.
“The COVID-19 vaccines are the best defense we have to further slow the spread of the pandemic,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Although cases are comparatively low from the January peak, the pandemic is not over. Every San Diegan should get all recommended COVID-19 vaccine doses so that we’re better protected against the virus and its likely variants.”
Fourth Doses Available for Everyone 50 and Older 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Western States workgroup have approved an additional COVID-19 vaccine booster —Pfizer or Moderna— for people 50 and older. Eligible San Diegans in this age group can now get the second booster locally.
“Older adults are more likely to have complications from COVID-19 and be hospitalized, especially if they have underlying health conditions,” Wooten said. “San Diegans should definitely consider getting a fourth dose if they qualify.”
The region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses. Vaccinations are available at pharmacies, medical providers, clinics, and County locations. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Over 2.95 million or 93.9% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Nearly 2.60 million or 82.5%.
Boosters administered: 1,213,038 or 55.6% of 2,182,257 eligible San Diegans.

943,"County Kicks Off Annual Blood Drive, Public Welcome",Help save lives by rolling up your sleeve and giving blood at the 38th Annual County Blood and Marrow Registry Drive.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208123,2022-04-04T14:41:08-07:00,"
Help save lives by rolling up your sleeve and giving blood at the 38th Annual County Blood and Marrow Registry Drive.
The month-long event officially kicked off Monday outside the County Administration Center. Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher was the first to donate.
The County’s blood drive is one of the largest held by the San Diego Blood Bank. More than 20 County facilities will take part this year with the overall goal of collecting 500 pints for local hospitals. The events are open to the public, as well as County employees.
During its 38-year history, the County’s annual blood drives have collected more than 20,000 pints of blood. Each pint can save up to three lives. The San Diego Blood Bank says over the years, the County’s blood drives may have saved up to 60,000 lives.
Currently, there is a critical need for blood donations, and all blood types are welcome. Appointments are highly encouraged but walk-up donors will be accepted if open slots are available.
COVID-19 guidelines will still be in effect and all donors and staff are required to wear masks. For questions regarding deferrals or blood donations related to COVID-19, review the Blood Bank guidelines for eligibility. If you can’t donate, family or friends are welcome.

Eligible voters can do so at any of nine vote centers in the district or at the Registrar’s office until 8 p.m.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208130,2022-04-05T07:00:35-07:00,"
Tuesday, April 5 is the final day to cast your ballot in the State Assembly District 80 Special Election. Eligible voters can do so at any of nine vote centers in the district or at the Registrar’s office until 8 p.m.
All in-person voters can mark their ballot on a ballot marking device. After the voter marks their selection using the device’s touch screen, they will print their official ballot, review it, place it in a secrecy sleeve and return it to a poll worker to place it in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar’s office. The ballot marking device does not store, tabulate or count any votes.
If you’re still holding onto your mail ballot, the Registrar’s office reminds you to return it promptly to a ballot drop box location or vote center in the district. Ballot drop box locations will also be open until 8 p.m. on Election Day. You can return it by mail, no postage needed, as long as it is postmarked on or before April 5 and received by the Registrar’s office by April 12.
Any voter who is in line at a vote center or ballot drop box location at 8 p.m. will be allowed to vote. However, no one can join the line after the 8 p.m. deadline.
Remember that campaigning or electioneering within 100 feet of a vote center or ballot drop box location is not allowed. This includes information you can see or hear that advocates for or against any candidate on the ballot.
Only those who live in the state’s 80th Assembly District under the 2011 district boundaries can vote in the election. The district covers portions of southern San Diego County and includes parts of the cities of Chula Vista, National City and San Diego. If you’re not sure whether you were in the 2011 district boundary, you can look it up at sdvote.com.

945,Observe Before Rescuing Found Kittens,It’s kitten season and the San Diego County Department of Animal Services is reminding people to hold off on immediately scooping up kitten litters they may encounter in their communities. Mother cats typically leave litters alone for some stretch of time while she hunts for food and then returns to them.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208133,2022-04-05T09:07:43-07:00,"
It’s kitten season and the San Diego County Department of Animal Services is reminding people to hold off on immediately scooping up kitten litters they may encounter in their communities. Mother cats typically leave litters alone for some stretch of time while she hunts for food and then returns to them.
But in some instances, they are gone because a well-meaning person wanted to rescue them.
From this time through October every year, underage kittens pour through the shelter doors.
If the kittens aren’t in immediate danger from such things as traffic or predators, and they aren’t visibly sick or injured, it’s best to observe them for a while to see if a mother cat will return – often she is just away from her kittens temporarily. Be sure to watch from a safe distance so the mother cat feels safe enough to return to her babies.
If you don’t see a mother cat return after six hours and feel the kittens need care, you can make an appointment to bring them to an animal shelter or try to care for them yourself. Many local pet stores carry kitten milk replacer and the proper bottles (please don’t use an eyedropper). Bottle-feeding kittens can be rewarding, but very time intensive, since round-the-clock feedings are needed until the kittens are old enough to eat solid food.
Keep in mind, age is a critical factor in found kittens’ ability to thrive (learn how to estimate a kitten’s age). Neonatal kittens are four weeks and under and are still nursing; they cannot survive on their own and need special care. Contact your veterinarian for details on caring for neonates.
If you decide to bring neonatal kittens to the shelter, staff will make every effort to find a partner shelter, foster caregiver, or rescue organization to properly care for these youngsters. If the kitten is not eating on its own and still nursing from the bottle, staff must find a rescue for it immediately as the shelter does not have overnight staff to care for neonatal kittens. Underage kittens also cannot be vaccinated yet and are susceptible to illnesses in a shelter environment. For these reasons, the kittens you may find are best off staying with their mother, if possible, until they are eight weeks old.
That’s why it’s so important to help reduce the number of unwanted kittens by spaying and neutering your cats, the free-roaming cats you see in your neighborhood, and by encouraging your neighbors to alter their cats. County Animal Services sees hundreds upon hundreds of kittens come in every year and there are a very limited number of foster homes or rescues for them all, so any support you may be able to offer these little ones is always much appreciated.
If you’d like to learn more about becoming a lifesaving foster caregiver, please contact the Department of Animal Services at DASinfo@sdcounty.ca.gov for more information or to sign up.

946,80th Assembly District Election Results – When to Expect Them,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time, even for a special election such as the 80th Assembly District Primary Election.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/80th-assembly-district-election-results-when-to-expect-them/,2022-04-05T13:02:07-07:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time, even for a special election such as the 80th Assembly District Primary Election.
So, what can you expect on election night?
The first set of results comes in shortly after 8 p.m. They include ballots that were mailed in, returned to ballot drop box locations, or cast during early voting at the Registrar’s office and vote centers prior to Election Day.
The Election Day vote center ballots come in after the vote centers close at 8 p.m. and must be driven in from nine locations across the 80th Assembly District.
Upon arrival, the ballots are scanned and results will be periodically updated until all of the vote center ballots have been counted. For the latest results on election night, you can visit sdvote.com or follow the Registrar’s office on Twitter.
The final unofficial election night results may not come in until midnight and will only cover the ballots that could be counted immediately.
A number of outstanding mail ballots will still need to be counted. The Registrar’s office mailed nearly 250,000 ballots for this election and a portion of those were dropped off at vote centers or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Mail ballots sent right before or on April 5 have seven days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots. People who missed the March 21 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day.
For those who register on Election Day, they can do so at any vote center. We don’t know how many people might do so, but it adds to the number of provisional ballots.
For each provisional ballot, election workers must make sure the voter didn’t already cast a ballot or was otherwise ineligible to vote.
Election workers must review and process every provisional and mail-in ballot envelope. It’s a labor-intensive, time-consuming process.
However, the results must be certified on April 14, and the Registrar expects to use every minute of the certification period to make sure the results are accurate.
If a candidate receives a majority vote, then they are elected for the remainder of the current term, ending December 2022. If no candidate receives a majority vote, then the top two vote-getters will move on to the special general election on June 7.

947,Vaccinations Urged for People at Higher Risk from Influenza,"An additional 157 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the region last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/vaccinations-urged-for-people-at-higher-risk-from-influenza/,2022-04-06T10:18:14-07:00,"
An additional 157 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the region last week, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
That is up from 121 reported the previous week. To date, 2,098 infections have been reported in San Diego County, compared to 752 at the same time last season. In comparison, the prior five-year average was 11,218 cases by the same week.
“While overall cases remain low despite the increase, influenza can result in serious illness, especially for older adults and the very young,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If you have not gotten a flu vaccine this season, it’s not too late to do it.”
The flu vaccine is especially important for people at higher risk of having serious complications from the virus.
They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending April 2, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 157 (compared to 121 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 2,098 (compared to 752 at the same time last season and a 11,218 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

949,San Diegans Urged to Take Precautions from Heat,Higher than normal temperatures are coming to the coast and inland valleys of San Diego County over the next two days. County health officials are urging residents to take precautions to avoid heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-urged-to-take-precautions-from-heat/,2022-04-06T17:42:46-07:00,"
Higher than normal temperatures are coming to the coast and inland valleys of San Diego County over the next two days.
The National Weather Service in San Diego has issued a heat advisory that is expected to last through 6 p.m., Friday, April 8.
County health officials are urging residents to take precautions to avoid heatstroke and other heat-related illnesses. San Diegans should also make sure vulnerable populations, especially children, older adults and pets, are protected.
“Older adults, infants and children, and people with chronic medical conditions are more prone to heat stress,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People with elderly neighbors should check on the well-being of the older persons.”
While the cool zones are not technically open, libraries, community centers and other buildings are open, and people can go cool there. Click here to see hours and locations for County libraries. The Borrego Library’s community room will be open from 12 to 5 p.m. Sat., April 9. Given the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, masks are strongly recommended indoors.
Pet owners should exercise their pets in early morning hours or late afternoon and early evening to avoid prolonged exposure to the heat.
Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler. Do not rely on electric fans for cooling if temperatures exceed 90 degrees.
To avoid heat-related problems, health officials recommend the following:

Stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty
Take cool showers
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun
Avoid using the oven to cook

Signs of heatstroke or exhaustion include an extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion and headache. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature, and continuing cooling efforts
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

950,County Modifies Vaccine and Testing Efforts to Vulnerable Populations,The County is modifying its COVID-19 testing and vaccination efforts to better reach San Diegans who struggle with accessing these services.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208151,2022-04-06T18:12:48-07:00,"
The County is modifying its COVID-19 testing and vaccination efforts to better reach San Diegans who struggle with accessing these services.
The focus will include providing its resources at public health centers and through mobile services, including two Live Well on Wheels buses and a bookmobile, which has been repurposed as a mobile vaccine clinic.
This shift comes as the majority of COVID vaccinations and tests in the region are now administered through pharmacies, medical offices and hospitals. About 10% of COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are being administered through the County.
“We have seen low demand at several of our existing testing and vaccination sites and are therefore shifting our efforts to more of the underserved safety net approach,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The County remains committed to providing no-cost vaccinations and testing across the region but recognize that most people now get these services elsewhere.”
Changes in the testing process have also come to the seven state-funded COVID-19 testing sites the County organizes. Individuals will now initially be administered an antigen test and wait about 15 minutes for the results to come back. If the results of the antigen test are positive, the individual is given a confirmatory PCR test, with results expected back within one day. In the meantime, they are advised to follow isolation protocol.
Following are the seven locations across the County that are offering the no-cost antigen/PCR testing process. More information about appointments and walk-ups is available at coronavirus-sd.com:

North Coastal Live Well Center, 3708 Ocean Ranch Blvd., Oceanside, 92056

Imperial Beach Sports Park Recreation Center, 425 Imperial Beach Blvd., Imperial Beach, 91932
Former USD Electronics Recycling Center, 5330 Linda Vista Rd., San Diego, 92110

For over two years, San Diego County residents have been feeling the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the region.
And through it all, thousands of people and organizations have been working to keep residents and communities safe.
Today, the County Health and Human Services Agency honored 58 individuals and organizations for their efforts to improve San Diegans’ health and quality of life during these unprecedented times.
The above video highlights the 2022 Live Well San Diego 21st Annual Public Health Champion Awards recipients. The awards are presented every year during National Public Health Week.

953,County Reports Slight Decrease in Flu Cases,"The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 134 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region, bringing the total case count for this season to 2,233.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208187,2022-04-13T11:30:41-07:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 134 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region, bringing the total case count for this season to 2,233.
That is 23 fewer cases than the previous week, when 157 cases were reported.
However, the case count for the season to date is almost three times higher than last flu season. At the same time last season, a total of 759 infections had been reported. In comparison, the prior five-year average was 11,363 cases by the same week.
“Influenza activity appears to be slowing down in the region, but immunocompromised San Diegans should continue to use precautions,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People who are at higher risk of having serious complications from the flu virus and have not received their flu shot should consider getting vaccinated to prevent illness.
This includes:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending April 9, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 134 (compared to 157 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 2,233 (compared to 759 at the same time last season and a 11,363 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

954,Second COVID-19 Pediatric Death Reported,"A 15-year-old girl died from COVID-19 and is the second death of someone under the age of 18 in the region during the pandemic, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today. The girl died on Feb. 3, 2022, had underlying medical conditions, and had not been vaccinated.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208191,2022-04-13T16:32:26-07:00,"
A 15-year-old girl died from COVID-19 and is the second death of someone under the age of 18 in the region during the pandemic, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The girl died on Feb. 3, 2022, had underlying medical conditions, and had not been vaccinated.
“Pediatric deaths are very tragic and unfortunate. Our condolences go out to the family and friends of this young girl,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “This unfortunate death reminds us that COVID-19 can impact anyone, regardless of age or gender, and we must do everything to protect ourselves and our loved ones.”
County health officials continue to encourage everyone eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19 to get all the recommended doses.  In addition to deaths, the pediatric age group is at risk for developing Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare but serious condition associated with COVID-19 in which different body parts become inflamed. 
Ninety-six MIS-C cases have been reported in San Diego County since the COVID-19 pandemic began.
In San Diego County, about 94% of those eligible—age 5 and older—have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. About 84% of those 12-17 have gotten at least one dose. The percentage drops to about 43% for those between the ages of 5 and 11.
A child gets vaccinated against COVID-19 at Rady Children’s Hospital.
The California Department of Public Health is working with local community organizations and pediatric medical providers to get children age 5 and up vaccinated against COVID-19. As part of the nine-week vaccination campaign, COVID-19 vaccinations will be offered at after school programs, libraries, local parks and other recreational areas.
“The more people who are vaccinated, the better protected we all will be,” Wooten said.
The region has plenty of COVID-19 vaccines and booster doses. Vaccinations are available at pharmacies, medical providers, clinics, and County locations. You can also make an appointment or find a site near you by calling (833) 422-4255 or 2-1-1 or by visiting the MyTurn or coronavirus-sd.com websites.
San Diegans Encouraged to Take Part in COVID-19 Antibody Study
San Diego County is one of seven California counties participating in CalScope, a study that will help public health professionals better understand how many people in California have antibodies against COVID-19.
The California Department of Public Health has randomly selected about 45,000 San Diego households to participate in the study.
If your household was selected, you should have received or should be receiving an invitation with a unique access code to sign up online or over the phone. You’ll be asked to complete an anonymous survey and a free, at-home COVID-19 antibody test using a finger-prick blood sample.
Each participant will receive a $20 gift card for completing the survey and a $20 gift card for returning the blood test sample.
The study will help CDPH and local health departments in California monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and refine strategies to protect the health of Californians.
For more information about CalScope, visit the study website at CalScope.org.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Over 2.96 million or 94.2% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.60 million or 82.7%.
Boosters administered: 1,229,500 or 55.9% of 2,200,612 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

The projects that received awards include Aviara East in Carlsbad, Union Tower in National City, Santa Fe Senior Village in Vista, COMM 22 in Logan Heights and Mariposa II in San Marcos. Combined, these five projects offer 375 units.
“Many area residents are priced out of the local market due to the rising cost of living,” said David Estrella, director of HHSA’s Housing and Community Development Services. “These funds will secure a stable place to live for some of the most vulnerable San Diegans.”

The funding for the five projects resulted from the County’s work with various federal and state housing initiatives, including HUD’s HOME Investment Partnership Program (HOME), The HOME Investment Partnerships American Rescue Plan Program, the Innovative Housing Trust Fund and the No Place Like Home program.
These newest investments in affordable housing projects are in addition to a previous round of funding announced in March for four projects in Vista, Ramona, Clairemont and San Ysidro. Combined, the funding totals more than $43 million, and will allow the County to support the addition of nearly 800 new affordable housing units throughout the region.

957,Tuberculosis Case Reported at San Ysidro High School,"A person at San Ysidro High School was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis and may have exposed students and school staff, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-case-reported-at-san-ysidro-high-school/,2022-04-19T16:39:51-07:00,"
A person at San Ysidro High School was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed students and school staff, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The dates of exposure were from January 11, 2022 to March 18, 2022. HHSA is working with San Ysidro High School officials to notify those who were potentially exposed. Meanwhile, the County’s TB Control Program is testing, at no-cost, all identified students and staff members.
“Testing is recommended for people who were exposed to assure they are not infected, since initial infection usually has no symptoms,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “For any infected individuals, early diagnosis and prompt treatment can prevent the infectious form of the disease.”
A negative test result usually indicates that the person is not infected with the TB bacteria. However, it may take eight to 10 weeks after exposure for a test to be positive. San Ysidro High School students and staff who were exposed  to the infected individual and receive a negative test result from their first TB test in April, will require a follow-up test next month.
About Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis is transmitted from person to person through indoor air during prolonged contact with an infectious person. Most people who are exposed do not become infected.
Symptoms of infectious tuberculosis include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss. People with symptoms of TB, or who are immune-compromised and may not show obvious symptoms, should consult their medical provider to be evaluated for the bacteria. Tuberculosis can be cured with an extended course of specific antibiotics.
People who would like more information on this potential exposure should contact the San Diego County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621, or San Ysidro High School at (619) 710-2300.
Tuberculosis is not uncommon in the San Diego region and, although decreasing since the early 1990s, case counts have stabilized in recent years. In 2021, 201 cases were reported in San Diego County. To date, 23 cases of tuberculosis have been reported in 2022.

960,Influenza Activity Slows as Flu Season Nears End,"The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 136 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region, bringing the total case count for this season to 2,351.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/influenza-activity-slows-as-flu-season-nears-end/,2022-04-20T10:52:48-07:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 136 new lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region, bringing the total case count for this season to 2,351.
No new flu deaths have been reported. Influenza-related deaths remain at four for the 2021/2022 season.
“Influenza activity appears to be slowing down, which is in line with the typical end of flu season in the region in April or May,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “However, people who are at higher risk of having serious complications from the flu should continue to take precautions to stay safe, including getting a flu shot, if they haven’t received one.”
Individuals at Higher Risk Include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The County will stop producing this season’s regular flu updates after next week, with the final report scheduled to be published on April 27.
The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending April 16, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 3% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 136 (compared to 120 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 2,351 (compared to 773 at the same time last season and a 11,469 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: 4 (compared to 2 at the same time last year).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

Though the figure is still well below daily case counts repeatedly over 10,000 in January of this year, County health officials are urging vulnerable populations to practice increased caution when out in public.
“The unfortunate hospitalization milestone and bump in cases in the region and across the country are a reminder that the COVID-19 pandemic is not over,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “San Diegans, especially those at higher risk for severe outcomes from an infection, should continue to utilize non-pharmaceutical interventions, like masking and staying away from sick people. Everyone should get vaccinated and boosted when they are eligible, protecting themselves and those around them.”
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Nearly 2.97 million or 94.3% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Close to 2.61 million or 82.8%.
Boosters administered: 1,237,325 or 55.9% of 2,213,453 eligible San Diegans.

963,Special Ceremony Honors Abused and Neglected Children,"The County’s Child Welfare Services and its partners held a moment of silence and a special flag raising ceremony Friday to honor the more than 1,700 children who die in the U.S. each year as a result of abuse, violence and neglect.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208242,2022-04-22T13:57:15-07:00,"
The County’s Child Welfare Services and its partners held a moment of silence and a special flag raising ceremony Friday to honor the more than 1,700 children who die in the U.S. each year as a result of abuse, violence and neglect.
That’s an average of five children per day, and the numbers have steadily increased over the last two decades. In addition to the deaths, more than 3 million cases of child abuse are reported in the U.S. each year.
The annual flag raising event at the Polinsky Children’s Center coincides with Children’s Memorial Day, which is part of National Child Abuse Prevention Month. The event is intended to provide the community with tools that help recognize the warning signs of abuse and neglect.
“Child abuse prevention starts with each one of us,” said Kimberly Giardina, Child Welfare Services director. “I encourage everyone in our community to educate themselves about the signs of child abuse, so we can collectively work towards preventing tragedies involving children.”
Polinsky Children’s Center provides temporary emergency shelter to children who must be separated from their families for their own safety. Partners at Friday’s ceremony included representatives from the County’s Behavioral Health Services, the San Diego County Office of Education, the San Diego Juvenile Court, Probation, Rady Children’s Hospital, Promises 2 Kids, and the YMCA.
The County Administration Center will be lit in blue Saturday in honor of National Child Abuse Prevention Month.
If you have reason to believe a child you know is experiencing abuse or neglect, contact the County’s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or 800-344-6000. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego, or check this website for a variety of resources related to child abuse prevention.

964,County Urges Parents to Get Children All Recommended Vaccinations,"April 24-30 is National Infant Immunization Week, and the County Health and Human Services Agency is urging parents to make sure their children are vaccinated against all vaccine-preventable diseases.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208252,2022-04-25T16:20:18-07:00,"
The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a negative impact in the number of San Diego children getting routine childhood vaccinations.
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report showed that during the 2020-21 school year, 94% of children had received all the required vaccines, about one percentage point lower than the previous school year.  In California, the decrease was about 0.3%.
April 24-30 is National Infant Immunization Week, and the County Health and Human Services Agency is urging parents to make sure their children are vaccinated against all vaccine-preventable diseases.
“The pandemic changed everyone’s everyday life and reminded us of the value of vaccinations when we are up against a new virus. It also reminds us of the importance of routine childhood vaccinations to keep children healthy,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Parents should make sure their children have all the recommended vaccines to protect them.”
Vaccines reduce disease, disability and death from a variety of infectious diseases.
The CDC recommends that children—from birth to 6 years of age—get vaccinated against 16 diseases. COVID-19 vaccinations are also urged for children five years of age and older.
Vaccine-preventable diseases are not that common in the United States thanks to vaccinations. However, these diseases continue to sicken people around the world, and cases of diseases like mumps, measles and pertussis, also called whooping cough, can and do happen in San Diego County.
Seasonal influenza is more common and requires a new vaccine each year and is recommended for all children 6 months and older.
“Vaccinations and doctor visits are essential to keep children healthy,” Wooten said.
In addition to infant immunizations, children need the following:

Children 4 to 6 years of age are due for boosters of DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis), chickenpox, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and polio.
Preteens and teens need a Tdap booster shot to protect against tetanus, diphtheria and whooping cough. They also should get meningococcal and human papillomavirus vaccines.

Parents can obtain the vaccines for their children through their regular medical provider. People with no medical insurance can get vaccinated at a County Public Health Center at no cost. Local retail pharmacies also offer some vaccinations for a fee.
For more information about vaccines, National Infant Immunization Week, or back-to-school vaccine requirements, visit the Health and Human Services Agency Immunization Unit  website at www.sandiegocounty.gov/iz or call (866) 358-2966.

965,County Bolstering Aerial Fire Resources,The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to strengthen aerial fire protection in the region by approving the purchase of a new twin-engine firefighting helicopter and adding two additional firefighting helicopters to a firefighting response agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208273,2022-04-26T18:08:08-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to strengthen aerial fire protection in the region by approving the purchase of a new twin-engine firefighting helicopter and adding two additional firefighting helicopters to a firefighting response agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric.
The Bell 412 EPX helicopter will be the first twin-engine in the Sheriff’s fleet. A twin-engine helicopter is safer, can fly at night, hoist more weight, carry more water and reach more locations to pick up water.
“The reality is we need a twin-engine firefighting helicopter in our county firefighting arsenal. This has been a long-desired goal of making sure as a region, we’re better prepared to fight wildfires,” said Board Chairman Nathan Fletcher at the meeting. “We know over time we will need more than one but moving forward now with one is the right step as we confront the realities of much more devastating risk of wildfires than we’ve seen in the past and we upgrade our fleet air support arsenal.”
The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department firefighting and search and rescue helicopter fleet now consists of three Bell 205 helicopters built in the 1960s and 1970s. During wildfires, CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire Protection District staff the helicopters, except for the pilot, for water drops. Eventually, all the Sheriff helicopters will be replaced with twin-engine models.
“It’s the next generation for ASTREA (Aerial Support to Regional Enforcement Agencies),” said Sheriff’s ASTREA Sgt. Gavin Lanning.
After a purchase is made, it typically takes 18 months for it to be delivered.
The Board also voted to amend an agreement with San Diego Gas & Electric to provide an additional two firefighting helicopters, bringing to five the number of helicopters available from the utility company to fortify an initial fire response. The agreement states that SDG&E pays for the first two hours of a new fire and the County pays for another two hours. In the event they are needed longer, the jurisdiction may choose to pay additional hours. Both SDG&E and the County have a $150,000 annual contribution limit.
The SDG&E fleet includes two Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawks, one Sikorsky S-64 Skycrane and one Airbus H145, with another Black Hawk to be added in 2023. All will be based in San Diego County and available to be assigned to local fires.
The County first entered into the agreement with SDG&E in 2009 and has renewed and expanded terms since then. In five years, the SDG&E helicopters have responded to 144 fires with 333 flight hours.

A 72-year-old woman is the fifth San Diegan to die of influenza this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.
The woman died on April 7. She had underlying medical conditions and did not receive a flu vaccine this season.
This latest influenza-related death brings the season total for the region to five.
There has also been a spike in new flu infections, with an additional 207 cases reported since last week. This increase in cases is prompting County health officials to continue publishing the weekly Influenza Watch Report until further notice.
“We typically end publication of this report at the end of April, but due to the recent increase in flu cases, we will continue to report on the situation,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “I advise anyone who is at a higher risk of developing complications from the flu to take precautions.”
Individuals at Higher Risk Include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

967,"County Affordable Housing Efforts Putting 3,400 Units in San Diego","Since 2017, the County has invested $175 million towards the creation of affordable housing.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208278,2022-04-27T11:26:10-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors on April 26 received an update on the significant efforts underway to increase the regional supply of affordable housing.
Since 2017, the County has invested $175 million towards the creation of affordable housing. The funds have leveraged about $1 billion in local, state and federal monies, as well as private funding, which are being used to create 3,390 affordable housing units that have housed and will become home for more than 35,000 San Diegans.
The wide-ranging efforts include 44 developments—10 completed, 13 under construction and 21 future projects—in 24 communities throughout the region, including eight County excess properties and four developments in unincorporated areas of the county.
Alora is located in San Marcos and is expected to open in summer 2023
The affordable units will provide housing for low-income families, seniors, veterans, developmentally disabled people, transition-aged youth, people who are homeless and people experiencing homelessness and have serious mental illness.
To date, 10 developments have been completed, resulting in 835 affordable housing units that have become home to over 2,900 people throughout the region.
“Completed developments presented today are just the first fruits of the affordable housing efforts we started five years ago,” said David Estrella, director of Housing and Community Development Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Housing development takes time. As a result of the these affordable housing efforts, the County’s pipeline of affordable housing has grown into a robust source of ongoing housing production and positive economic impact for the San Diego region.”
The 13 developments under construction are expected to create over 950 affordable housing units and are expected to be completed between now and December 2024.
Furthermore, the 44 developments could generate 3,400 construction jobs and about 1,000 permanent property management and maintenance positions.
About $42 Million in Housing Funds Requested for Region
The Board also directed the County to apply for nearly $30 million in additional No Place Like Home funds from the state to house people experiencing homelessness and who have serious mental illness.
This fourth and final allocation of No Place Like Home funds will bring the total for the region to nearly $123 million.
The Board also opted to allocate $12 million in American Rescue Plan Act funding for permanent supportive housing units for extremely low-income households.

968,County Provides Legal Defense for Immigrants,"The County of San Diego announced today a first-of-its-kind legal defense program for immigrants going through removal proceedings in federal court. People detained, on monitoring or under house arrest can now receive free legal representation contracted by the Public Defender’s Office.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208291,2022-04-29T08:33:42-07:00,"
The County of San Diego announced Thursday a legal defense program for immigrants going through removal proceedings in federal court. People detained, on monitoring or under house arrest can now receive free legal representation contracted by the Public Defender’s Office.
“Eight out of ten people facing deportation in San Diego County cannot afford to hire an attorney,” said County Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer. “Today, San Diego County is changing that and making history in the process. San Diego County is now the first border region in the United States to provide free legal representation for immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers facing removal proceedings. We are declaring with one voice that our justice system must be based on facts and laws, not access to wealth and resources.”
The Immigrant Legal Defense Program uses three contractors to provide legal counsel to anyone detained here in San Diego County. That representation starts before they go to their first hearing until their case is finished.
The Board of Supervisors approved this initiative looking for a solution which upheld the principles of fairness and due process in our immigration courts.
“Our program is established, not to promote illegal immigration, but exactly the opposite,” said Michael Garcia, director of the Office of Assigned Counsel and the leader of project. “It is meant to promote the lawful application of our immigration laws and due process within the four walls of all our courtrooms in the County of San Diego.”
Garcia continued, “Of those unrepresented, 83% have to navigate the complex legal system on their own. The success rate of gaining any relief whatsoever during their case is a mere 4%. By contrast, when represented by counsel, the success rate climbs to over 40%.”
Those seeking legal representation can contact any of three service providers to help with their cases:
· American Bar Association Immigration Justice Project: 619-736-3315
· Southern California Immigration Project: 619-516-8119
· Jewish Family Service: 858-637-3365
“Immigration law is one of the most complicated areas of law and trying to navigate it without help is overwhelming – and if you’re detained, it’s almost impossible,” said Andrew Neitor, an attorney with the Southern California Immigration Project. “This program isn’t just important for individuals in need of a lawyer, it’s important for our entire system of justice, where we have always believed that people should be able to have legal representation regardless of their race, nationality, or income.”
The pilot program will be used to gather data and inform future immigrant legal defense projects. The program is intended to reduce the backlog in the immigration system, reduce the workload of immigration judges and save taxpayer dollars by moving people through the system more efficiently and getting people out of expensive detention facilities.
Muna Shegow, a downtown resident and refugee who fled war-torn Somalia in 1999, and her 9-year-old daughter were once detained because of a paperwork mix-up. An attorney was able to clear up the issue, getting both released from detention and back to their community.
“I don’t know what I would have done without the help of my attorney.” she said.
Supervisor Lawson-Remer says detainees with legal counsel are four times more likely to be released allowing them to return to their jobs, to their families, and their communities while they await the results of their legal matter, and they can get back to work supporting their families.

969,"Countywide Effort Aims to Eliminate DUI Fatalities, Injuries","Today, the County Health and Human Services Agency, San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan, and other community partners joined forces in support of Vision Zero, a countywide initiative to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries related to driving under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs to zero by 2025.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208288,2022-04-29T13:21:12-07:00,"
About seven San Diegans are injured every day in motor vehicle crashes involving drivers impaired by drugs or alcohol.
Today, the County Health and Human Services Agency, San Diego District Attorney Summer Stephan, and other community partners joined forces in support of Vision Zero, a countywide initiative to reduce the number of fatalities and injuries related to driving under the influence of alcohol and/or other drugs to zero by 2025.
In 2021, nearly 40 fatalities were caused by people driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to the San Diego County District Attorney. The figure surpasses the 33 fatalities reported in 2020 and more than doubles the 18 deaths which occurred in 2019.
Last year also saw a record number of alcohol- and drug-related incidents with over 400 crashes reported. In comparison, 380 DUIs occurred in 2020 and 350 in 2019. In 2021, about one-third of DUI cases involved people who were under the influence of alcohol, cannabis, and prescription drugs, often at the same time.
Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency, said there has been a 14% increase of DUI injuries in San Diego County over the last five years, a trend that is alarming.
“We are addressing this trend head-on through multi-layered prevention efforts including advocacy of environmental changes and education around safe consumption,” Bergmann said. “We need to continue to work toward educating the public about safe consumption, with particular attention to the dangers of consuming multiple substances simultaneously.”
Bergmann said servers, retailers, promoters, and marketers of alcohol and cannabis need to be aware of the responsibilities surrounding safe consumption. A new California law taking effect later this year will require alcohol servers and sellers to be trained about the effects of alcohol, signs of overserving, and how to refuse service.
The County funds the Binge and Underage Drinking Initiative and the Marijuana Prevention Initiative, as well as the Meth Strike Force and the Prescription Drug Abuse Task Force. The County also funds prevention and treatment services throughout the region.
People experiencing a substance use problem can call the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego.

970,San Diego County K-12 Youth Services Community Grant Program,"The County announced today grant awards of up to $250,000 are available to help community and non-profit organizations support, promote, and improve educational options for San Diego County children.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208306,2022-05-02T15:55:55-07:00,"
The County announced today grant awards of up to $250,000 are available to help community and non-profit organizations support, promote, and improve educational options for San Diego County children. County leaders want to help organizations identify and implement new and innovative methods to support educational equity and acceleration of learning, support behavioral health needs, address housing, food stability, and poverty, and provide mentorship opportunities for kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) youth and their families.
This opportunity is made possible by fines imposed by the court related to the District Attorney’s successful prosecution of one of the nation’s largest fraud schemes targeting state dollars intended for K-12 education.
“It is truly rewarding for our team at the District Attorney’s Office to see millions of dollars that were recovered in restitution as part of our massive public corruption prosecution be used to care for our children by reducing inequities and improving opportunities for students across San Diego County.” said San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan.
This past fall, a workgroup was convened to help identify areas of need that could positively impact K-12 youth in our community. Representatives from the Office of the District Attorney, the Office of Equity and Racial Justice, Health and Human Services Agency, Behavioral Health Services and Child Welfare Services, Live Well San Diego Youth Sector and the County Office of Education participated in this important effort.
“It’s critical to provide students with the tools necessary not just to survive but thrive in life,” said San Diego County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Paul Gothold. “But schools can’t do that alone. This grant program will help support students, families, and communities with high-impact partnerships, wraparound services, and deeper learning. By working with our partners, we can fully prepare students for the world as it is today so they can forge the tomorrow they want and we all need.”
The County is using these funds to provide an opportunity for smaller community-based organizations to begin promising new programs or to expand existing programs to improve educational outcomes and reduce inequities and disparities in our communities.
Proposals for the K-12 Youth Services Community Grant must focus on one or more of the following focus areas:

Educational Equity/Acceleration of Learning
Behavioral Health Needs
Housing, Food Stability, Poverty
Mentorship

Organizations interested in applying for a K-12 Youth Services Community Grant must apply by 5 p.m., Friday, June 3. Grants are expected to range from $50,000 to $250,000 to be utilized for up to a twelve-month period.

Almost half of the state’s largest and most damaging wildfires occurred in 2020 and 2021, burning almost 7 million acres.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/be-prepared-for-wildfires/,2022-05-02T18:43:11-07:00,"
The County of San Diego joined CAL FIRE and partner agencies at the Ramona CAL FIRE Air Attack Base today to explain what you can do to prepare for wildfires. Almost half of the state’s largest and most damaging wildfires occurred in 2020 and 2021, burning almost 7 million acres. But there are proactive steps you can take to prepare your home and communities to be more resilient to the impacts of wildfire. 

Create defensible space around your property by maintaining your lawn and removing combustible debris from around your home. 
Harden your home by using fire resistant materials for construction, renovation and landscaping to help protect your property. 
Make and share a family wildfire emergency plan. Talk to your neighbors about wildfire safety and plan how the neighborhood can work together before and after a wildfire. 

“San Diego County is prepared, and we are ready to respond to wildfires,” stated Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher. “Since the devastating 2003 Cedar Fire, your County has invested more than $600 million. Those investments have improved fire protection and EMS, added staffing, fire stations, made communication enhancements, increased training and brush management. We’ve also added more ground and air equipment.” 
Supervisor Joel Anderson said, “Some of the things we can do is really focus on the grants to help people harden their homes which we’ve done. We’ve all voted to spend $1 million towards that goal. We also worked so that when you need to evacuate a place like Ramona, Alpine or Fallbrook the roads aren’t restricted. We’ve cut back all the trees along the evacuation routes, so people have a chance to get out.” 
The event was the first of a statewide campaign to help Californians prepare for wildfires. The CAL FIRE Director was there to speak and show off some of the agency’s newest equipment. He was joined by representatives from the California Natural Resources Agency, United States Forest Service, California Office of Emergency Services, the California Military Department, the Highway Patrol and the CAL FIRE San Diego Fire Chief, Tony Mecham. 
Chief Mecham praised all local fire crews, “San Diego County is unique, and I believe we are one of the most prepared regions in the United States. And the reason that we are so prepared is we have a mindset of collaboration and cooperation.”

975,County First in Nation to Use Rapid DNA-Based Beach Water Testing to Protect Public,"San Diego County became the first coastal county in the nation to start using a rapid, DNA-based ocean-water testing technology this week that will yield faster results and earlier warnings to protect beachgoers when bacteria levels reach unhealthy levels in ocean water.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208350,2022-05-04T15:48:15-07:00,"
San Diego County became the first coastal county in the nation this week to start using a rapid, DNA-based ocean-water testing technology that will produce faster results and earlier warnings to protect beachgoers when bacteria levels reach unhealthy levels in ocean water.
County Board of Supervisors Vice Chair Nora Vargas, County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma J. Wooten, officials from the County’s public health lab, its Department of Environmental Health and Quality, and others gathered Wednesday morning near the Imperial Beach Pier for the announcement.
Vargas said the County plans to expand its use Thursday of the DNA-based droplet-digital polymerase chain reaction testing technology — ddPCR — to more than 70 miles of shoreline the County regularly samples and tests to protect the public.
The new system will let the County sample beach water in the morning, get results and warn the public by the afternoon instead of the next day.
Officials said the DNA-based system is also more sensitive to bacteria levels than the older method, which required growing bacterial cultures from water samples in petri dishes.
“I’m happy to announce with today’s sampling, San Diego becomes the first coastal county in the nation to implement the ddPCR method for beach water sampling,” Vargas said Wednesday to applause.
“Faster results,” she said, “are going to allow the County to issue or lift beach advisories on the same day samples were collected. And it reduces the time the public could unknowingly be at risk and … when the water is contaminated.”
The County’s Public Health laboratory and the state conducted a side-by-side study of how the DNA testing compared to the petri-dish system in 2019.
The California Department of Public Health gave the new system its final laboratory approval in February, clearing the way for the County to expand its use of the process.

Mental health has a powerful influence on people’s quality of life. Experts say it affects how people feel about themselves, how they handle stress, make choices and relate to others. San Diegans’ mental health should be as important as their physical, but, too often, it gets overlooked or ignored.
May is Mental Health Matters Month and County behavioral health officials say there’s no better time than now to take stock of your mental health and the mental well-being of those you care about.
Throughout May, the County and its many partners are asking San Diegans to help raise awareness about the importance of mental health. By doing that, you will help to reduce the stigma associated with mental illness which is what keeps people from getting the help they need. A list of organizations and activities taking place in May is available here.
“The sooner people reach out for help, the better off they will be. It’s important for everyone to observe and check their emotional well-being and to share with friends and loved ones how they’re feeling,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Taking good care of our minds and engaging in self-care activities is a good exercise to improve our behavioral health and improve our overall quality of life.”
Bergmann says San Diegans should use the Mental Health Matters Month resources as an opportunity to promote community awareness of mental health and check in with people who may be struggling or recovering from a mental health condition.
In the past few years, the County has made significant increases in investment and funding to provide better access to behavioral health services.
People needing immediate behavioral health assistance should call 9-1-1. Help is also available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego or by visiting www.Up2SD.org.

Board Chair Nathan Fletcher, San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria and County Deputy Chief Administrative Officer for Public Safety Holly Porter toured the center, which becomes a hub for members of different agencies to coordinate actions during emergencies.
Disasters faced by San Diego include wildfires, flooding, earthquakes, oil spills, tsunamis, pandemics and even acts of terrorism.
“We think about how we are ready to respond to any situation that might occur,” said Board Chair Nathan Fletcher. “The folks who come to the emergency operations center, these are the unseen heroes, the folks who coordinate logistics, supplies and water and getting power turned back on and coordinate evacuation routes. And everyday of the year, they are doing planning and exercises and drills to make sure that our region is ready to respond to any situation or any crisis that we face.”
All leaders come together to help with an emergency, bringing “many voices, but one message” through collaboration and coordination.
“Your City and County governments are working together seamlessly,” said San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria. “We work collaboratively, we share information, we share resources in order to make sure that when the unthinkable happens we are prepared to respond and do it effectively.”

978,County Budget Builds on Commitments Across Key Areas,"The County of San Diego released a $7.15 billion recommended budget today that builds on its commitments to address mental health, homelessness, equity, racial justice, and climate change.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208353,2022-05-05T08:24:32-07:00,"
The County of San Diego released a $7.15 billion recommended budget today that builds on its commitments to address mental health, homelessness, equity, racial justice and climate change. It would add significant investments and just over 1,000 staff across priority areas. The budget also maintains essential public safety, land use, health and social services.
The total recommended budget is 1.1% smaller than the budget the County Board of Supervisors approved last year, mainly because many one-time costs for COVID-19 response are no longer needed.
The County Board of Supervisors must approve a new budget by June 30 and County leaders are urging the public to take part in the approval process. The board will get an overview of the budget during presentations by County departments at public meetings May 19 and 20. The public can comment in person or by phone at two budget hearings in June: a daytime hearing June 13, and an evening session June 16. People can also comment online through e-comment until budget hearings close. See more information on how to comment at Board of Supervisors meetings.
In addition, the public can attend virtual community budget meetings for each Board of Supervisors district (find your district):

May 23: District 3
May 31: District 4
June 2: District 1
June 6: District 5
June 8: District 2

The recommended budget makes investments in these key areas:
Mental Health and Substance Use Support
The new budget recommends adding $71.8 million and 115 new positions to help continue County efforts to transform its behavioral health system, from one of crisis response to prevention, continuous care and everyday health care to keep people connected and healthy.
The budget will continue to improve services to help people with mental health challenges and substance use disorders, focusing on those who have historically suffered silently, including people experiencing homelessness and youth.
Funds will support Mobile Crisis Response Teams, made up of mental health experts rather than law enforcement, to respond to someone in crisis.
The budget also includes a wide variety of resources to match the right type of care with the person in need – things such as recuperative care, school-based services, services for foster youth, people in long-term care services and the LGBTQ community.
Homelessness and Housing
Mental health and substance use support are combined with investments in innovative housing solutions to make significant progress in ending homelessness.
Increased investments in the new recommended budget include $11.9 million from one-time stimulus funds to develop affordable housing to reduce homelessness.
Another $10 million increase would be spent to help people experiencing homelessness regionwide by working with cities to buy shelters and places for people to stay. One recent partnership with the Lucky Duck Foundation and the City of San Diego will result in a 150-bed emergency shelter opening this summer.
Additional efforts to create more affordable housing for residents include $3 million to waive permit fees to encourage building accessory dwelling units. Another $810,000 will create an inclusionary zoning ordinance, which will require new development to include housing that people at or below median income levels can afford.
Justice Reform
The County’s justice system continues to move toward prevention, rehabilitation and training to help people avoid justice involvement and successfully come back to our communities following time in custody. This includes the Alternatives to Incarceration initiative. The initiative supports alternatives to jail and provides services and care, including mental health and sobering services, for people who don’t pose a public safety threat.
More than $130 million is invested in health care services in the County’s jails to help offenders.
Roughly $6.2 million will be spent on a Youth Development Academy to help young people who have committed serious offenses by giving them more intensive, longer-term behavioral health, rehabilitative and skill-building services to help them come back to our communities.
County Probation will use $1 million toward de-escalation training for their staff, supporting the young people they supervise.
The Juvenile Diversion Initiative and Transitional Age Youth Diversion program in the District Attorney’s office will be bolstered with $2.4 million, to give juveniles the opportunity to accept services and counseling instead of prosecution.
The Public Defender’s Office will add $21.8 million and 90 staff to defend clients, represent immigrants and the indigent in our neighborhoods, and improve transitions back into communities.
The District Attorney will use $3.5 million and add 18 positions to expand services to victims of crime, including the South Bay Center for Community Resiliency and Trauma Recovery, and a resentencing program.
Equity and Access
The new budget also continues efforts to weave equity into all County programs and services.
The County Office of Equity and Racial Justice has implemented its new Budget Equity Assessment Tool that helps County departments prioritize services and allocations with equity in mind. The tool uses a series of questions to better understand how allocations affect historically marginalized vulnerable communities, those who are low-income or those who have historically and currently suffer from inequality.
The tool also incorporates community engagement, an important cornerstone of the County’s operations that will be expanded in this budget to provide opportunities for all community members to play meaningful roles in discussions and decision-making.
Increased translation and interpretation services will provide greater access to services and information.
A new Office of Sustainability and Environmental Justice will be funded with $3.5 million and work to make sure all communities have the same protection from health hazards.
And the San Diego County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement will serve as the central location for education and resources for employers and their workers; it will undertake research and data analysis regarding worker issues, and pursue enforcement measures to protect workers.
Sustainability and Fighting Climate Change
Climate change is already affecting San Diego County communities and the County is working hard to address the issue through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing sustainability.
More than $25 million will be invested to cut greenhouse gas emissions in our unincorporated communities, including $1 million to support electric vehicle charging stations.
Nearly $60 million will be spent on other environmental improvements, including $40 million to address stormwater issues, $16.3 million on the Multiple Species Conservation Program and $3.4 million to improve the Tijuana River Valley.
Green building and solar energy will be promoted by waiving an estimated $2.1 million in permit fees. More than 3,500 trees intended to trap more than 178,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year will be planted around the county.
Greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced — while equitable access to health care is boosted — by allocating $2 million to buy two additional Live Well on Wheels vehicles and a new mobile public health lab that can bring services to residents rather than requiring them to travel individually to health offices.
Supporting Families 
This budget also includes additional funding and positions to focus on the day-to-day needs of residents at home and at work, especially the most vulnerable.
In-Home Supportive Services for older adults and people who are blind or disabled will be boosted by 60 positions. Another 100 new positions will bolster essential services including CalFresh and Medi-Cal, to help people get the food and health care they need. Child Welfare Services will also add 100 new positions to increase emergency response support, and quality placement for children in care, to strengthen prevention services and continue improving connecting families to community-based services.
More than $30 million received through the America Rescue Plan Act of 2021 will continue to support the Board of Supervisors’ framework for using the funds, including mental health services for young people and support for renters and nutrition programs.
The County’s new Office of Economic Development & Government Affairs will foster inclusive economic growth, provide opportunities in arts and culture, and administer grant programs that focus on nonprofits and community-based organizations.
And the County’s new Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics will use data and analytics to better inform decisions that impact our communities and improve service delivery.
Enhancing Communities and Keeping Them Safe
The budget also invests in safety and quality of life.
This includes $2.9 million for land for a future public safety facility located at Interstate 15 and State Route 76, and $250,000 to start plans and design for a new Jacumba fire station.
In addition, the San Diego County Fire Protection District is adding $2.2 million to protect communities and reduce community wildfire risk in unincorporated areas through roadside vegetation management and creating fire breaks.
Public Health Services will add 71 new positions to continue to strengthen its overall ability to protect our residents’ health.
The budget would spend $550,000 for new and expanded County parks, including Calavo, Star Ranch, Lindo Lake, Park Circle and the Waterfront Park. And a Food Access Initiative to help create community gardens will be funded with $1 million.

981,"Proms, Graduations Call for COVID-19 Precautions","Given that it’s prom and graduation season, the County Health and Human Services Agency is reminding parents to make sure their children are up to date on their vaccinations and boosters and to take other preventive measures to avoid getting sick.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208456,2022-05-05T15:54:29-07:00,"
Given that it’s prom and graduation season, the County Health and Human Services Agency is reminding parents to make sure their children are up to date on their vaccinations and boosters and to take other preventive measures to avoid getting sick.
“When large groups of people gather indoors, the risk of getting and spreading COVID-19 increases,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Having all the recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, wearing a mask indoors, washing your hands and taking other precautions is the best way to protect yourself and others.”
Kaiser added that attending large gatherings or events increases your chance of being in close contact with people outside your household and being exposed to COVID-19, especially now that the region is experiencing an increase in cases.
People who feel sick should stay home and isolate themselves from others. However, if you come into close contact with someone with COVID-19, you should:

Wear a mask around others for 10 days, even at home
Get tested 3-5 days after the exposure
Monitor for symptoms and stay home if you’re ill
Isolate and notify your close contacts if you test positive for COVID-19

COVID-19 Treatment Available in San Diego
If you do get COVID-19, County health officials say treatment is available. Treatment can help prevent high-risk individuals from getting sick enough to need hospital services and even from dying from COVID.
Oral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral medications require a doctor’s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.
To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider. Monoclonal Antibody Regional Centers (MARCs) offer treatment with the monoclonal antibody Bebtelovimab, which is effective against the Omicron variant. You can call (619) 685-2500, seven days a week, to schedule a no-cost appointment, regardless of health insurance or immigration status. A referral or prescription is not required.

Federal Test to Treat locations can provide testing and treatment in one location. For more information, call (800) 232-0233 or visit the Test to Treat website for locations and what treatments they carry.
“Vaccinations are still the best protection we have to prevent serious illness, hospitalization and death from COVID-19,” Kaiser said “However, treatments reduce the risk of hospitalization and death for people who get COVID-19, whether they have been vaccinated or not. Treatment is available throughout San Diego.”
Since the MARCs opened in February of last year, a total of 9,323 patients have been treated, thanks to the collaboration with hospitals, federally qualified health centers and local municipalities.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 2.95 million or 93.7% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.61 million or 83.1%.
Boosters administered: 1,310,571 or 58.2% of 2,252,277 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Seven new deaths were reported since the last report on April 27. The region’s total is 5,244.
Four women and three men died between Jan. 21, 2022 and May 2, 2022.
Three of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s and two were in their 60s.
Three of the people who died were fully vaccinated and four were not fully vaccinated.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

1,926 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (May 2-4, 2022). The region’s total is now 763,422.
4,110 cases were reported in the past week (April 28-May 4) compared to 2,977 infections identified the previous week (April 21 through April 27).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 8.25 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 5.30 for fully vaccinated people and 14.36 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.

Laguna Fire Station #49,” shared Supervisor Joel Anderson.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208431,2022-05-05T17:50:03-07:00,"
County Fire, CAL FIRE and the community of Mt. Laguna on Wednesday celebrated the completion of the County’s highest elevation fire station, sitting at about 6,000 feet.
“I am honored to recognize the grand opening of Mt. Laguna Fire Station #49,” shared Supervisor Joel Anderson. “I am thankful for all the firefighters and staff that keep our County safe—and I am hopeful that this strategically placed fire station will help them do just that.”
The building is shared with County Department of Public Works crews, who are responsible for maintaining roads, including plowing snow or clearing debris following storms.

https://www.countynewscenter.com/wp-content/uploads/IMG_3785-1920.mp4
Station 49 has 5,000 feet of floor space including the area for two fire trucks.  It also includes sleeping quarters for 6 firefighters, a living area, kitchen, office space and gym. There is also a second story balcony so firefighters can enjoy the outdoor environment. The station was built using fire-resistive materials as it is in a high wildfire area.
The site also has very specific lighting systems to maintain the light pollution standards of the International Dark-Sky Association, so it does not impede the research performed at the Mt. Laguna Observatory near the station.
CAL FIRE San Diego Chief Tony Mecham said, “The new fire station is the beautiful end result of working with the community and former volunteer fire department to assure the continuance of fire protection and emergency medical services on Mt Laguna.”

The Registrar of Voters is seeking additional poll workers throughout the county for the June 7 Gubernatorial Primary Election. Poll workers play an essential role in elections and can serve their community while earning $15 per hour.
There is a particular need for additional poll workers in Linda Vista, Valley Center, Pala, Warner Springs, Borrego Springs, Dulzura, Santa Ysabel and Jacumba. Applicants do not need to live in those communities to work at vote centers in those locations.
With the introduction of the Voter’s Choice Act, vote centers replace traditional polling places. Vote centers are open throughout the county for an extended period before Election Day. Rather than a single day of service, poll workers are now needed to staff vote centers up to 11 days in the two weeks before Election Day.
English speakers who are bilingual in Spanish, Filipino, Vietnamese or Chinese are also needed.
Responsibilities include:

Submitting hiring/payroll paperwork
Attending a two-day, paid poll worker training
Opening/closing a vote center
Processing voters
Answering voter questions

To become a poll worker, applicants must be 18 years old, a U.S citizen and registered to vote in California, or lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Applicants must also provide their own transportation to their assigned vote center.
The Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership and customer service skills, and display flexibility, patience and the highest level of integrity at all times. Poll workers must represent the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner.
The Registrar’s office is working with Public Health Services to ensure the health and safety of election workers and voters. Recommended personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies will be provided to workers so they can conduct the election process safely.
Applications are available online. For more information, call (858) 565-5800 or email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.

It is National Nurses Month, and the County would like to recognize the hundreds of County nurses who are devoted to caring for people throughout the region’s hospitals, neighborhoods and homes.
County nurses deliver compassionate, trauma-informed care, often in challenging circumstances. They meet people where they are to provide person-centered service with special attention to inclusion, diversity and equity.
Throughout the pandemic, County nurses committed countless hours to the frontlines of the COVID-19 response, offering exceptional care and courageous leadership. They interacted with vulnerable populations including older adults, children and people experiencing homelessness. They ensured a rapid and equitable response in high-risk communities. They adapted to changing protocols and solved problems with innovation and perseverance.
The efforts of County nurses played a big part in the region reaching nearly 94% of its population having received at least one COVID-19 vaccination, placing San Diego among the top 10 counties in California.
The County thanks its nurses for their unwavering commitment to the public’s health and well-being, for their hard work and compassion for all, and for their mission to ensure a healthier tomorrow.

987,All Local Law Enforcement Agencies to Refer Calls to County Mobile Crisis Response Teams,"County behavioral health officials, law enforcement representatives and community partners today announced that all of the region’s 911 dispatchers have signed on to a memorandum of understanding to refer certain mental health calls to the County’s Mobile Crisis Response Teams.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208497,2022-05-12T15:00:32-07:00,"
County behavioral health officials, law enforcement representatives and community partners today announced all of the region’s 911 dispatchers have signed on to a memorandum of understanding to refer certain mental health calls to the County’s Mobile Crisis Response Teams.
MCRTs began in January 2021 as a pilot in the North County. Since then, the non-law enforcement program has expanded countywide and responded to 1,277 referrals: 1,099 through the County’s Access and Crisis Line and 178 through referrals from law enforcement. The service also expanded in April to offer in-person response 24 hours a day.
Of the 1,277 calls received:

47% were about people who were able to be stabilized in the community and referred to treatment services
22% of people were transported to crisis behavioral health treatment services, such as a crisis stabilization unit
13% of the people declined services
18% were people who needed more acute intervention (such as going to an emergency department), people who could not be located or canceled calls while MCRT was en route
43% were white, 30% were Hispanic, 10% were Black, 6% were Asian/Pacific Islander and 9% were other, mixed or unknown ethnicity

Of those MCRT has served, approximately 20% were people experiencing homelessness.
What do MCRTs Do?
The Mobile Crisis Response Teams provide non-law enforcement, community-based crisis response. The Teams provide crisis intervention, triage and connection to appropriate behavioral health services.
MCRT County contractors are Exodus Recovery, Inc. and Telecare, they initially received referrals from the Access and Crisis Line, Chula Vista and National City police departments. Now, all other law enforcement agencies have agreed to refer calls, including the Sheriff’s Department.
“As a County we have continued to work to better address the mental health needs and crisis that we face in our street,” Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher said at a news conference outside the County Administration Center. “We are incredibly grateful that this is a regional response. Our entire region is committed to doing things differently and to figure out how we can do more.”
Mobile Crisis Response Teams are for people experiencing a mental health or substance use crisis. Calls about people who are a threat to themselves or others are handled by law enforcement who are better suited to manage the situation.

“When someone is experiencing a behavioral health crisis, our teams of clinicians, case managers and peer staff who are trained to respond to a behavioral health crisis meet the person in the community where they live,” said Christian Hodges, clinical director at Telecare. “We know how to deescalate the situation, connect with them on a personal level, and provide them with the care and services they need to improve their circumstances.”   

The teams of behavioral health experts offer non-law enforcement intervention whenever possible. They travel to the patients to assess the individual’s condition, expedite medication, connect them to support services including food and shelter and even provide transportation.
“The ability to offer the community a non-law enforcement, clinician-led, behavioral health crisis response benefits the community, individuals and families who need assistance in a crisis,” said Dr. Piedad García, deputy director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Although we have come a long way, the MCRT is still in its infancy stage. We will continue to expand, adjust and modify as needed based on input from the community and our partners to ensure we are meeting the needs of our community.”
The County funds prevention and treatment services throughout the region. If you, or someone you care about, needs treatment, please call the Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240.

988,County Encourages Skilled Nursing Facility Residents to Get All COVID-19 Boosters,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults and those with compromised immune systems have been at the greatest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. New data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that these high-risk populations have a better survival chance when they are both vaccinated and boosted.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208510,2022-05-12T17:55:19-07:00,"
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults and those with compromised immune systems have been at the greatest risk of severe outcomes from COVID-19. New data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now shows that these high-risk populations have a better survival chance when they are both vaccinated and boosted.
The CDC report evaluated vaccination and infection data from close to 15,000 skilled nursing facilities during the height of the Omicron variant earlier this year. The data indicates that booster COVID-19 vaccine doses provided greater protection against Omicron than just the primary series of the two-dose Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, or one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
Boosters are currently available for everyone age 12 and older. Anyone 50 and older, and those who are severely immunocompromised, can get an additional dose four months after their initial booster.
More than 600,000 County residents ages 50 and older are currently eligible to receive a second booster, but so far, less than one in five in that group has taken advantage of the additional shot.
County health officials recommend that all immunocompromised San Diegans, especially those in skilled nursing facilities, get their booster doses when eligible.
“The majority of our local deaths have been in unvaccinated San Diegans, or those who did not receive the recommended booster doses,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “As infection cases are beginning to trend up again in the region, I encourage anyone who is eligible for a booster to get it as soon as possible.”
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 2.95 million or 93.8% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Close to 2.62 million or 83.1%.
Boosters administered: 1,316,265 or 58.3% of 2,256,074 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

27 additional deaths were reported since the last report on May 4. The region’s total is 5,271.
Of those 27 additional deaths, 13 were women and 14 were men. They died between Aug. 4, 2021 and April 6, 2022.
The majority of the newly-reported deaths were older cases discovered during the County’s routine quality assurance process.
17 of the people who died were 80 years or older, five were in their 70s, one was in their 60s, two were in their 50s, one was in their 40s and one was in their 20s.
22 of the people who died were fully vaccinated and five were not fully vaccinated.
26 had underlying medical conditions and one has medical history pending.

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

2,236 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (May 9-11, 2022). The region’s total is now 768,368.
4,995 cases were reported in the past week (May 5-May 11) compared to 4,110 infections identified the previous week (April 28-May 4).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 11.69 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 6.98 for fully vaccinated people and 23.56 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
8,306 tests were reported to the County on May 8, and the percentage of new positive cases was 6.2% (Data through May 8).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through May 8, is 4.9%.

The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency and its partners are working together to get the word out about CalFresh benefits during the month of May, which is designated as CalFresh Awareness Month.
Numerous scheduled community events will be used to promote the program and provide San Diegans with free screenings and application assistance.
CalFresh is a supplemental nutrition program for families and individuals who meet certain income guidelines. The program is designed to reduce food insecurity and increase food budgets to improve participant’s access to fresh and healthy food.
The need for supplemental nutrition assistance has greatly increased over the last couple of years, in part due to the rising cost of living in the region, as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
CalFresh plays a critical role in filling that need, with 354,204 people in San Diego County currently receiving the benefit, up 6.8% from a year earlier. Maximum monthly amounts for qualifying households range from $250 for a single person to $835 for a household of four an up to $1,316 for a household of seven.
In addition to attending one of the upcoming events, San Diegans can also apply for CalFresh online at GetCalFresh.org and MyBenefitsCalWIN.org, or by calling 2-1-1 San Diego. For more information about CalFresh, visit the County’s CalFresh page.

992,Child Support Services Recognized for Innovative Program,The San Diego County Department of Child Support Services received an award for two new programs to help families work through problems facing many parents. The Innovation in the Child Support Program Award was given to the County by the California Child Support Directors Association.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208525,2022-05-13T17:00:55-07:00,"
The San Diego County Department of Child Support Services received an award for two new programs to help families work through problems facing many parents.
The Innovation in the Child Support Program Award was given to the County by the California Child Support Directors Association. The award highlights the department’s Expanded Service Delivery and Youth with Dreams programs.
The Child Support Services team understands their customers come from all walks of life and are often working, handling child care, struggling with transportation and working though daily hurdles. The need to visit an office during common hours can be an obstacle for many parents. The Expanded Service Delivery Program allows customers to receive help at a time and setting that works for them.
Child Support now connects with families via chat, video conferencing, texting, through a call center or even in person on Super Saturday events. All are options to let customers meet with representatives quickly and conveniently. There are even family law facilitators to help answer questions for those who do not have access to an attorney.
Almost 5,000 families have conducted virtual conferences, more than 2,000 have used the chat feature, and nearly 450 customers visited on Super Saturdays.
The Youth with Dreams program was started last year to encourage teen and young adult parents to continue reaching for goals. In the program, young families access essential resources like education, employment and resources to help lead a self-sufficient life. The goal is to reduce barriers young customers face, dismantle stereotypes associated with teen and young adult parents, and to help end the cycle of intergenerational poverty. In less than a year, more than 400 people were receiving help through the Youth with Dreams program.

994,Sixth Influenza Death Reported in San Diego County,"A 76-year-old woman from North County is the sixth influenza death reported this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/sixth-influenza-death-reported-in-san-diego-county-2/,2022-05-18T10:25:12-07:00,"
A 76-year-old woman from North County is the sixth influenza death reported this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The woman, who died May 6, had underlying medical conditions. She had not gotten a flu vaccination and did not have COVID-19 when she died.
“Our condolences go out the family and friends of the latest flu victim,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Influenza can be deadly, especially for older adults who are more susceptible to the virus. If you have not gotten a flu shot, do it now as influenza continues to sicken people in our communities.”
Of the flu deaths this season, four have been in 2022 and two in late 2021. Last season, a total of two influenza deaths were reported.
The flu vaccine is especially recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending May 14, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 3% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 179 (compared to 186 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,082 (compared to 798 at the same time last season and a 11,660 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: six (compared to two last season).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The coronavirus vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

995,COVID-19 Boosters Expected to Soon Be Available for Children 5 to 11,"Pending approval from the Western States committee, booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine may soon be available for San Diego children ages 5 through 11, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208561,2022-05-19T16:05:10-07:00,"
Pending approval from the Western States committee, booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine may soon be available for San Diego children ages 5 through 11, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The COVID-19 Pfizer boosters should be given five months after receiving the final dose of the primary vaccine series.
“Some parents have been anxiously waiting to give their children extra protection against COVID-19 and the shots may be finally approved,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “COVID-19 boosters for everyone who is eligible are easy to get because we have plenty of vaccine available in the region.”
MIS-C Cases in San Diego County
While COVID-19 symptoms tend to be less severe in children, the Omicron variants have been making more San Diego children sick, with some requiring hospitalization and others developing multisystem inflammatory syndrome or MIS-C. From November 27, 2021 to May 7, 2022, 90% of the pediatric hospitalizations for the syndrome occurred in not fully vaccinated children.
Since the pandemic began, there have been 98 MIS-C cases in San Diego County.  Fifty-three percent of MIS-C cases have been reported in children ages 5 to 11 and the majority (60%) have been Hispanic.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, “MIS-C is a rare, but serious, postinfectious hyperinflammatory condition occurring about 2 to 6 weeks after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.”
Symptoms of MIS-C include fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea, skin rash, inflammation and multiorgan dysfunction. In severe cases, children can experience hypotension (low blood pressure) and shock. Approximately 60-80% of the early cases of MIS-C patients required intensive care admission.
“MIS-C can often be so severe that children require life-saving interventions. Parents should contact their doctor immediately if their child develops any of these symptoms,” Wooten said. “The best thing parents can do is get all the recommended doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for themselves and their children.”
Vaccine supplies remain plentiful, both for those seeking initial doses and those eligible for boosters. People can get vaccinated or a booster through their medical provider, a retail pharmacy or a site operated by the County. Additional booster eligibility details are at coronavirus-sd.com.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Nearly 2.96 million or 94.0% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.62 million or 83.3%.
Boosters administered: 1,323,824 or 58.5% of 2,264,730 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

11 additional deaths were reported since the last report on May 12. The region’s total is 5,282.
Of those 11 additional deaths, six were men and five were women. They died between Jan. 17, 2022 and May 15, 2022; two of the deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Six of the people who died were 80 years or older, three were in their 70s, one was in their 60s and one was in their 20s.
Five of the people who died were fully vaccinated and six were not fully vaccinated.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

3,409 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (May 16-18, 2022). The region’s total is now 775,369.
7,007 cases were reported in the past week (May 12-May 18) compared to 4,995 infections identified the previous week (May 5-May 11).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 15.67 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 8.86 for fully vaccinated people and 34.84 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
9,611 tests were reported to the County on May 14, and the percentage of new positive cases was 7.3% (Data through May 14).

The County of San Diego has hired Ricardo Basurto-Dávila to be its new Chief Evaluation Officer and lead one of the County’s newest offices, the Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics.
The office’s job will be to increase the County’s ability to collect, share and analyze data to help County leaders create and improve policies and programs to address top priorities including mental health, homelessness, equity, racial justice, and climate change.
County supervisors voted to create the office in May 2021, and it is still being developed.
Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer said Basurto-Dávila will be a valuable addition to the County.
“We conducted a nationwide search to find Ricardo and he brings a wealth of academic, research and data science experience to our County,” Robbins-Meyer said. “His experience in leading evaluation teams for the County of Los Angeles in the areas of health, justice, housing and social services will serve our Board perfectly as they look to create and improve policies. I’m excited that he will lead our efforts to become a national leader in the field of data-driven, evidence-based policy making.”
“I am beyond excited!” Basurto-Dávila said. “I have a passion for finding the most effective ways to use data to help government leaders make their best decisions and San Diego County’s Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics creates the perfect opportunity to do that.”
The County hired a national search firm that talked with over 40 County and community leaders to help build a comprehensive pool of local and national candidates over a period of six months. Basurto-Dávila was selected from a group of six finalists from more than 200 candidates. He started his new position May 16.
Basurto-Dávila most recently was a principal analyst at the County of Los Angeles Chief Information Office, where he led a data-science team with the county’s Analytics Center of Excellence. Before that he served as a health economist with the County of Los Angeles’ Department of Public Health, helping build and lead a team that conducted economic evaluations and health impact assessments of public policies. He also served as a Prevention Effectiveness Fellow with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, where he helped use data analytics to evaluate U.S. and international responses to the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic.
Basurto-Dávila earned a doctorate in policy analysis from the Pardee RAND Graduate School in Santa Monica, California; a Master of Science in economics from the University of Texas at Austin; and a Bachelor of Arts from ITESM, the Tecnológico de Monterrey, in Monterrey, Mexico.

The County of San Diego garnered 61 Achievement Awards this year including a Best in Category nod from the National Association of Counties, which recognizes innovative county government programs.
“As a County, we are always striving to identify and offer needed programs and services for our region, so it is validating to receive recognition from the National Association of Counties for 61 programs addressing varying issues such as the environment, community engagement, community assistance, building up our youth, and certainly public health,” Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher said. “Our workforce is rising up to the challenge and continues to innovate to meet emerging issues.”
A San Diego County Treasurer-Tax Collector program set in a video game-style virtual environment to engage employees enrolled in the County’s deferred compensation plan into choosing an asset allocation strategy won a Best in Category Award for NACo’s Employment and Training category. The Investing Learn to Earn Virtual Event was created and implemented when many employees were working remotely due to the pandemic and was a way to provide information that can seem too complex to some and hinder financial wellness.
The County received the awards in 15 categories. More than a dozen are programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to support the region’s workforce, employers, renters, and public health providers, systems and scientists. Other programs streamlined County processes to benefit users, supported youth and families, protected the environment including agriculture, addressed housing insecurity and emergency preparedness.

County Fire and CAL FIRE are working to turn a sixth-grade camp site at the base of Palomar Mountain into a fire center to train new firefighters. Today, a board letter from Supervisor Jim Desmond recommended the County finalize an agreement with CAL FIRE to use the Camp Fox site as a wildland firefighting base.  The Camp Fox property was owned by the County, but transferred to the San Diego County Office of Education in 1977.  It is now transferring back to the County.
The new Fox Fire Center is already being updated by CAL FIRE. When it is complete, four CAL FIRE hand crews will live at the property to help provide 24-hour wildland fire protection coverage.  The crews will train daily in wildland fire prevention, education and suppression exercises such as hose lays, brush cutting, line cutting, and tree falling. CAL FIRE Recruits will also conduct prescribed fire burning, brush clearing for defensible space and fuel reduction in surrounding communities.
“This is an exciting win for the County and a great opportunity to further support wildland fire suppression in the back country,” said District 5 County Supervisor Jim Desmond. “I want to thank our County Fire Staff for making this possible.”
County Fire Director Jeff Collins said, “It is great to see the County, CAL FIRE and the San Diego County Office of Education work together to secure this exceptional location to prepare our professional firefighters and better protect the region.”
The Fox Fire Center is now housing two firefighter hand crews per day.  The crews are working to clean up the site and complete general maintenance to the former sixth-grade camp.

1000,Responding to Children about Violent Incidents,A County mental health expert offers parents advice on responding to children after school shootings and other violent incidents.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208606,2022-05-25T09:41:09-07:00,"
Read this article in Spanish: Respondiendo a los niños sobre incidentes violentos
Children who learn of violent incidents like the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas can experience a great deal of anxiety and fear. Those emotions can last for days or weeks.
For many, the feelings could be compounded by anxiety suffered following earlier mass shootings, including those at a grocery store in Buffalo, New York and a church in Orange County.
The County of San Diego’s deputy director for Behavioral Health Services, Dr. Piedad Garcia, said it’s important for parents to be aware of their children’s responses. They should be ready to talk openly but without providing too many details.
“Each child exhibits distress differently,” Garcia said. “It has to do with their age, their maturity, their individual experiences.”
Parents should monitor how their children are doing and acknowledge that their children’s feelings are OK. Their sleep routines and appetite may be disrupted. These are all normal reactions, Garcia said. Provide emotional support. It may take minutes, hours or even days for the incident to affect children. When it does, provide nurturance (hugs, empathy, kindness, calm support) and ask about their thoughts and feelings.
She advises parents to limit children’s exposure to information on the tragedy. Media reports often repeat distressing images and ongoing coverage can exaggerate the event in children’s minds.
“Sometimes what happens is they are overly stimulated by the information and that can create even further anxiety,” Garcia said.
Parents can emphasize to children that the event has ended and reassure them that they are safe, Garcia said.
She said to answer children’s questions simply, without dramatizing the incident. And provide perspective, explaining that these incidents are not a common occurrence.
Garcia said children’s caregivers need to be aware of their own stress levels and try to stay calm. Children look to parents for a sense of security and safety. Adults should talk to another adult about what they’re feeling, too.
The County also operates the Access and Crisis Line seven days a week, 24 hours a day, where people can get help for issues such as depression, anxiety, anger or other mental health challenges. The number is 888-724-7240.
Mental health experts also offered these behavioral signs that may show your child is reacting to the incident:

Infants up to two years old may react to their parents’ anxiety or other responses. The infants may be irritable, they may cry more than usual and want to be cuddled.
Preschool-aged children are not able to fully understand the tragedy, but they may know enough to feel helpless and overwhelmed. They may feel fear and insecurity about being separated from caregivers. They may try to re-enact the incident through play activities.
Elementary school-age children have a better ability to understand the tragedy. They may become intensely preoccupied with the details of the event and want to discuss it. Other reactions may include sadness, generalized or specific fears about the event happening again, as well as feelings of guilt, overreaction or inaction. They may feel angry that the event was not prevented or have fantasies of rescuing others.
Middle school and high school-age children could become involved in dangerous, risk-taking behaviors such as reckless driving or alcohol and drug use. Others may be fearful of leaving home. A teenager may have intense feelings but not want to discuss them. They may not want to attend school or participate in school-based activities. School performance may decline. Teens may become argumentative and/or withdrawn.

1001,Seventh Influenza Death Reported in San Diego County,"An 89-year-old North County woman is the seventh influenza death reported in the region this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208612,2022-05-25T11:42:44-07:00,"
An 89-year-old North County woman is the seventh influenza death reported in the region this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The woman, who died May 9, had underlying medical conditions, had received a flu vaccination, and did not have COVID-19 when she died.
Her death is the second influenza death recorded in the County during the month of May. Health officials note that deaths are uncommon this late in the season.
“We are seeing a late spike of influenza cases in our region this season and it is not too late to get vaccinated against it,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “The same precautions we use for COVID-19 also help protect anyone who is at higher risk of complications from the flu.”
The County also reported an additional 196 lab-confirmed influenza cases in the region last week, a slight increase compared to the prior week, when 176 cases were recorded.
Although the flu vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone six months and older, it is especially recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending May 21, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 196 (compared to 176 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,274 (compared to 823 at the same time last season and a 11,686 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).

1002,Respondiendo a los niños sobre incidentes violentos,"Los niños que se enteran de incidentes violentos como el tiroteo en las escuelas de Uvalde, Texas, pueden experimentar una gran ansiedad y miedo. Esas emociones pueden durar días o semanas.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208616,2022-05-25T13:05:14-07:00,"
Los niños que se enteran de incidentes violentos como el tiroteo en las escuelas de Uvalde, Texas, pueden experimentar una gran ansiedad y miedo. Esas emociones pueden durar días o semanas.
Para muchos, los sentimientos podrían verse agravados por la ansiedad sufrida después de tiroteos masivos anteriores, incluidos los de una tienda en Buffalo, Nueva York y una iglesia en el condado de Orange.
La subdirectora de Servicios de Salud del Comportamiento del Condado de San Diego, la Dra. Piedad García, dijo que es importante que los padres estén al tanto de las respuestas de sus hijos. Deben estar dispuestos a hablar abiertamente, pero sin dar demasiados detalles.
“Cada niño exhibe angustia de manera diferente”, dijo García. “Tiene que ver con su edad, su madurez, sus experiencias individuales”.
Los padres deben monitorear como les va a sus hijos y reconocer que sus sentimientos están bien. Sus rutinas de sueño y apetito pueden verse interrumpidos. Todas son reacciones normales, dijo García. Proporcionar apoyo emocional. Pueden pasar minutos, horas o días para que el incidente afecte a los niños. Cuando lo haga, brinde apoyo (abrazos, empatía, amabilidad, apoyo tranquilo) y pregúntele sobre sus pensamientos y sentimientos.
Ella aconseja a los padres que limiten la exposición de los niños a la información sobre la tragedia. Los informes de los medios a menudo repiten imágenes angustiantes y la cobertura continua puede exagerar el evento en la mente de los niños.
“A veces lo que sucede es que la información los estimula demasiado y eso puede créales más ansiedad”, dijo García.
Los padres pueden enfatizarles a los niños que el evento ha terminado y asegurarles que están a salvo, dijo García.
Dijo que respondiera a las preguntas de los niños de manera simple, sin dramatizar el incidente. Y proporcionar una perspectiva, explicando que estos incidentes no ocurren con frecuencia.
García dio que los cuidadores de los niños deben ser conscientes de sus propios niéveles de estrés y tratar de mantener la calma. Los niños buscan en los padres una sensación de seguridad y protección. Los adultos también deben hablar con otros adultos sobre lo que sienten.
El Condado también opera la Línea de Acceso y Crisis los siete días de la semana, las 24 horas del día, donde las personas pueden obtener ayuda para problemas como depresión, ansiedad u otros problemas de salud mental. El número es 888-724-7240.
Los expertos en salud mental también ofrecieron estas señales de comportamiento que pueden mostrar que su hijo está reaccionando al incidente:

Los bebés de hasta dos años pueden reaccionar a la ansiedad u otras respuestas de sus padres. Los bebes pueden estar irritables, pueden llorar más de lo normal y quieren que los abracen.
Los niños en edad preescolar no pueden comprender completamente la tragedia, pero pueden saber los suficiente como para sentirse impotentes y abrumados. Pueden sentir miedo e inseguridad por estar separados de los cuidadores. Pueden tratar de recrear el incidente a través de actividades de juego.
Los niños en edad escolar primarias tienen una mejor capacidad para comprender la tragedia. Pueden estar intensamente preocupados por los detalles del evento y quieren discutirlo. Otras reacciones pueden incluir tristeza, temores generalizados o específicos de que el evento vuelva a ocurrir otra vez, así como sentimientos de culpa, reacción exagerada o inacción. Pueden sentirse enojados porque el evento no se impidió o tener fantasía de rescatar a otros.
Los niños de edad de escuela intermedia y secundaria podrían involucrarse en comportamientos peligrosos y arriesgados, como conducir de manera imprudente o consumir alcohol y drogas. Otros pueden tener miedo de salir de casa. Un adolescente puede tener sentimientos intensos, pero no querer discutirlos. Es posible que no quieran asistir a la escuela o participar en activadas escolares. El rendimiento escolar puede disminuir. Los adolescentes pueden volverse argumentativos y/o retraídos.

To celebrate the opening, there will be numerous features and free fun for kids and families, including a “live” Mirabel Madrigal character — the fictional heroine of “Encanto” — bounce houses, themed crafts, music, games and other free activities. Although the movie starts at dusk, about 15 minutes past sunset, activities are expected to begin at 6 p.m. People should dress warmly and bring blankets as the weather is expected to be chilly.
The Summer Movies in the Parks events are a great way for families and friends to enjoy the outdoors, great parks, the night sky and great movies. Just bring a blanket or a lawn chair, maybe a picnic basket, settle back and enjoy adventures, comedies, superheroes and animated classics for the kids.
Now in its 14th year, The County’s Department of Parks and Recreation has teamed up with eight cities and numerous local sponsors, including presenting sponsor Rose SD Realtor Group, to expand the number of movies and parks over the years.
This year’s schedule includes more than 150 movie showings in parks around the county, including 55 at 30 County of San Diego parks and facilities through October 29.

1005,County Moves to Medium Risk in CDC’s COVID-19 Community Level,"Due to high levels of virus spread in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has moved the County of San Diego to its medium-risk level for COVID-19.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-moves-to-medium-risk-in-cdcs-covid-19-community-level/,2022-05-26T17:42:40-07:00,"
Due to high levels of virus spread in the community, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has moved San Diego County to its medium-risk level for COVID-19.
The CDC tracks community levels of the virus based on geographic regions to determine the impact of COVID-19 in communities, and to allow individual jurisdictions to implement preventive strategies based on the latest local data.
The CDC’s risk levels are low, medium, or high and a region’s level is determined by looking at hospital bed capacity, hospital admissions, and the total number of new COVID-19 cases in an area.
What Actions You Can Take
The medium-risk level means that San Diegans who are immunocompromised should consider resuming higher levels of protective measures to prevent illness and speak to their doctor about other steps they can take to stay well.
Everyone, regardless of individual risk level, should stay up to date with their vaccines and booster doses and get tested if they develop symptoms of COVID-19.
“While facial coverings are no longer mandatory in most places, the County, along with the California Department of Public Health, strongly recommends masking, especially indoors and around those who may be vulnerable to COVID-19,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Spread of the virus has increased in recent weeks and we should step up individual efforts to keep our community safe.”
COVID-19 Treatment Available in San Diego
If you do get COVID-19, County health officials say treatment is available. Treatment can help prevent high-risk individuals from getting sick enough to need hospital services and even from dying from COVID.
Oral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral medications require a doctor’s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.
To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider. Monoclonal Antibody Regional Centers (MARCs) offer treatment with the anti-viral pill Paxlovid and with monoclonal antibody Bebtelovimab, which are both effective against the Omicron variant. You can call (619) 685-2500, seven days a week, to schedule a no-cost appointment, regardless of health insurance or immigration status. A referral or prescription is not required.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 2.96 million or 94.1% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.62 million or 83.4%.
Boosters administered: 1,330,530 or 58.5% of 2,273,207 eligible San Diegans.

Of those six additional deaths, three were men and three were women. They died between Jan. 21, 2022 and May 15, 2022; two of the deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Five of the people who died were 80 years or older and one was in their 70s.
Three of the people who died were fully vaccinated and three were not fully vaccinated.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

13,982 tests were reported to the County on May 21, and the percentage of new positive cases was 8.6% (Data through May 21).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through May 21, is 7.3%.

1006,"County Nears 10,000 Monoclonal Antibody Treatment Milestone","Nearly 10,000 San Diegans diagnosed with COVID-19 have received monoclonal antibody treatments since these intravenous infusions became available in the region in February of last year. Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight viruses.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208644,2022-05-26T17:50:35-07:00,"
County health officials urged San Diegans diagnosed with COVID-19 to seek the treatments now available, as they gathered to mark a milestone in fighting the disease.
Nearly 10,000 San Diegans diagnosed with COVID-19 have received monoclonal antibody treatments at the Monoclonal Antibody Regional Centers (MARCs) since these medications became available in the region in late 2020.
More recently, antiviral pills were introduced, and are now recommended as a first option. Both antiviral pills and monoclonal antibodies are available at the MARCs.
“We know treatments work and can lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization by nearly 90 percent,” said Jennifer Tuteur, M.D., County deputy chief medical officer. “If you test positive for COVID, please isolate from others and seek treatment as soon as you can if you develop symptoms and are at high risk.”
Treatment can prevent a person from progressing to more severe illness, therefore cutting down on need for hospitalizations and risk of dying from COVID. The antiviral pills are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego, including Test to Treat sites (1-888-634-1123). Antiviral pills must be prescribed by a health care provider and started within five days of symptoms to be effective. Monoclonal antibodies must be started within seven days.
To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.
MARCs operate seven days a week with locations in Vista, Clairemont, Hillcrest, and Chula Vista. MARCs offer treatment with the antiviral pill Paxlovid and the monoclonal antibody Bebtelovimab, both of which are effective against the Omicron variant.
You can call (619) 685-2500 to schedule a no-cost appointment at the MARCs, regardless of health insurance or immigration status. A referral or prescription is not required.

1007,Some Voters Have Two State Assembly Contests on June 7 Ballot,"An estimated 250,000 registered voters in the southern part of San Diego County will have two State Assembly contests on their ballot for the June 7 Gubernatorial Primary Election.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208654,2022-05-27T10:56:54-07:00,"
An estimated 250,000 registered voters in the southern part of San Diego County will have two State Assembly contests on their ballot for the June 7 Gubernatorial Primary Election.
The ballot shows two contests. One is to fill a vacancy in the 80th Assembly District for the remainder of the current term ending Dec. 5. The other is a primary for an Assembly District to fill the new term beginning Dec. 5.
A special primary election was held April 5 to fill the vacancy in the 80th Assembly District, but none of the candidates received more than half the votes to win the seat. The top two vote getters in the April 5 primary are now on the June 7 ballot for a special runoff election to fill the vacancy.
Only those who live in the 80th Assembly District under the 2011 district boundaries can vote to fill the vacancy because the term was started under those boundaries.
District boundaries were changed by the 2020 Census. Some of the voters may now reside in a different State Assembly District. Those remaining in the 80th District can vote in the vacancy runoff and the primary for the 80th District. Those who changed districts can vote for the 80th District vacancy and the primary for their new district.
Voters can look up their new 2021 districts at sdvote.com.

1010,Flu Continues Late-Season Surge,"An additional 205 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the region last week, far exceeding the number of infections identified during the same week in previous seasons, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-continues-late-season-surge/,2022-06-01T11:19:33-07:00,"
An additional 205 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported in the region last week, far exceeding the number of infections identified during the same week in previous seasons, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
In comparison, seven flu cases were reported during the same week last season and an average of 27 infections were identified during the same period over the past five seasons.
No new flu deaths were reported in the past week. Influenza-related deaths remain at seven for the 2021-2022 season.
“During average flu seasons, influenza activity would be winding down by this time, but we are seeing a late spike in cases this year,” said Ankita Kadakia, Deputy Public Health Officer. “Even though it is late in the season, it is not too late to vaccinate if you have not done so.”
Although the flu vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone six months and older, it is especially recommended for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch Report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending May 28, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (compared with 4% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 205 (compared to 196 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,479 (compared to 830 at the same time last season and a 11,713 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

The County of San Diego on Wednesday kicked off its 2022 Cool Zones program to help San Diegans beat the heat this summer. Cool Zones are free, air-conditioned locations, available throughout the region, where people can go to escape extreme temperatures.
A list of Cool Zones locations is available online. People can enter their address once they navigate to the map and it will show locations near them. Residents can also call 2-1-1 to find a location.
Excessive heat can be particularly dangerous for seniors and children, and they are advised to seek shelter in cool locations when temperatures rise. Working or exercising outside on a hot day, or staying in an overheated place for too long can cause heat-related illnesses, including cramps, exhaustion and heatstroke.
An extremely high body temperature (103 degrees or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion, and headache are signs of heatstroke or exhaustion. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the person immediately.
San Diegans who are unable to get to a Cool Zone on their own can call 2-1-1 to request transportation to a location free of charge.
In addition to Cool Zones, the County, in partnership with San Diego Gas & Electric, provides free electric fans to San Diegans who are living on limited incomes.
To be eligible for the fan program, a county resident must not have access to an air-conditioned space at their home or apartment building. To learn more about the Cool Zones Fan Program or to request a fan, call 2-1-1.

1014,COVID Cases on Rise as Summer Activities Get Underway,"Cases of COVID-19 continue to increase in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208692,2022-06-02T16:06:58-07:00,"
Cases of COVID-19 continue to increase in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.
Weekly average coronavirus cases have more than tripled in the past 30 days. Hospitalizations and ICU admissions are also up.
The growing case counts are prompting the County, consistent with the state’s SMARTER Plan, to remind San Diegans to continue using established protective measures. This includes the state’s strongly recommended guidance of voluntary masking when out in public.
Masking is particularly important when traveling or moving through crowded indoor spaces, as is avoiding large gatherings, especially if you are immunocompromised.
“Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and staying up to date on all recommended boosters is the best protection San Diegans can take amid the current surge of new cases,” said Ankita Kadakia, Deputy Public Health Officer. “Get-togethers with friends and family are popular during summer months, but take precautions to keep your loved ones safe, including staying home if you are sick, getting vaccinated or boosted, and cleaning your hands frequently.”
Boosters are available for everyone age five and older. Those 50 and older, and those who are severely immunocompromised, are encouraged to get a second booster four months after their initial booster.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Close to 2.97 million or 94.3% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Nearly 2.63 million or 83.5%.
Boosters administered: 1,336,530 or 58.6% of 2,280,870 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

1016,Tuesday is Last Day to Vote in Primary Election,"Tuesday, June 7 is the final day to cast your ballot in the Gubernatorial Primary Election. Voters can do so at any one of 218 vote centers or 132 official ballot drop box locations around the county.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208703,2022-06-06T09:38:38-07:00,"
Tuesday, June 7 is the final day to cast your ballot in the Gubernatorial Primary Election. Voters can do so at any one of 218 vote centers or 132 official ballot drop box locations around the county.
All will be open on Election Day, June 7, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Any voter who is in line at a vote center or ballot drop box location at 8 p.m. will be allowed to vote. However, no one can join the line after the 8 p.m. deadline.
If you’re not registered to vote and want to participate in the election, you may visit any vote center to conditionally register and vote provisionally through Election Day.
Once the voter registration is processed and the Registrar’s office confirms the voter did not vote elsewhere in the state, the voter registration becomes active, and the provisional ballot is counted.
Vote centers replace polling places and provide more services. Vote center services include:

Vote in person or drop off a mail-in ballot
Vote using an accessible ballot marking device
Receive assistance and voting materials in multiple languages
Register to vote or update your voter registration and vote on the same day

Voters can use a touch screen to make their selections on the ballot marking device. When finished, the voter will print out the official ballot with their selections. The voter can review the ballot and then it is placed in the ballot box to be counted at the Registrar’s office. The ballot marking device does not store, tabulate or count any votes.
Remember that campaigning or electioneering within 100 feet of a vote center or ballot drop box location is not allowed. This includes the visible display or audible dissemination of information that advocates for or against any candidate on the ballot. Additionally, an individual may not circulate any petitions, including for initiatives, referenda, recall, or candidate nominations.

1017,When to Expect Gubernatorial Primary Election Results,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208709,2022-06-07T09:44:41-07:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time. Here are some reasons why:

Over 1.9 million registered voters.
Every active registered voter received a ballot in the mail.
Mail ballots can be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and received up to 7 days after.
Vote centers opened for up to 11 days, May 28 – June 7.

So, what can you expect on election night?
The first set of unofficial election night results comes in shortly after 8 p.m. This will include mail ballots received before Election Day and vote center ballots from early voting between May 28 – June 6. They will also include votes for qualified write-in candidates.
For the latest results update on election night, you can visit sdvote.com or follow the Registrar’s office on Twitter.
After the first unofficial report, election night updates will include vote center ballots cast on Election Day only. There will be no more updates to mail ballots and write-in candidates on election night.
The Election Day ballots come in after the vote centers close at 8 p.m. There will be a gap in time for the next set of results due to poll workers packing up supplies and driving in from the county’s 218 vote centers.
Upon arrival, the vote center ballots are scanned and results will be periodically updated until all of the vote center ballots have been counted. Since there are fewer vote center locations compared to the traditional polling place model, the Registrar’s office expects to provide less frequent result updates.
The final unofficial election night results may not come in until 1 a.m. or later and will only cover the ballots that could be counted immediately. The counting of ballots does not end election night.
What’s left to count?
Mail ballots. The Registrar’s office mailed over 1.9 million ballots for this election and a portion of those were dropped off at vote centers or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Mail ballots sent right before or on June 7 have seven days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots. People who missed the May 23 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally up to and on Election Day. It is unknown how many people will choose to do that.
Once the voter registration is processed and the Registrar’s offices confirms the voter did not vote elsewhere in the state, the voter registration becomes active, and the provisional ballot is counted.
After election night, the next release of unofficial results will be posted by 5 p.m. on Thursday, June 9. Additional updates will occur at the discretion of the Registrar of Voters.
However, the results must be certified on July 7, and the Registrar expects to use the full certification period to make sure the results are accurate. All updates will be posted on sdvote.com with the final certified results posted by July 7.

1018,"Summer is Almost Here, and Influenza is Not Gone","Summer is just around the corner, but influenza continues to sicken San Diegans.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208714,2022-06-08T10:15:50-07:00,"
Summer is just around the corner, but influenza continues to sicken San Diegans.
A total of 195 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported last week, a figure similar to flu totals identified in recent weeks and far greater than the sums detected at this time in previous seasons.
During the same week last year, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced five influenza cases, and during the past five seasons, the same time period had an average of 18 flu infections.
Influenza-related deaths remain at seven for the 2021-2022 season.
“Influenza isn’t easing up,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “The same precautions we take for COVID-19 work for the flu, too. And it’s not too late this season to get your flu shot.”
The flu vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone six months and older, but it is especially important for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending June 4, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (up from 4% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 195 (down from 206 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,675 (compared to 835 at the same time last season and a 11,731 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

1020,"County Surpasses 800,000 COVID-19 Cases Since Start of Pandemic","More than 800,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the San Diego region since the start of the pandemic, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208737,2022-06-09T16:14:11-07:00,"
More than 800,000 COVID-19 cases have been reported in the San Diego region since the start of the pandemic, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.
The County has recorded a total of 803,293 cases of the virus since the first local case was identified in March 2020.
Weekly average coronavirus cases have more than tripled in the past 30 days. Hospitalizations are also on the rise.
“The somber milestone and recent spike in cases should serve as a reminder this isn’t the time to let our guard down,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Please, make sure you’re up to date on your vaccinations and boosters, and consider a mask, especially if you’re medically vulnerable yourself or may be around people who are.”
Masking is particularly important when traveling or moving through crowded indoor spaces, as is avoiding large gatherings.
County health officials stress that vaccination and boosters continue to be the best defense against COVID-19 and associated hospitalizations or death.
Boosters are available for everyone age five and older. Those 50 and older, and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, are encouraged to get a second booster four months after their initial booster.
Treatment Options
San Diegans who test positive for COVID-19 can access monoclonal antibody treatment and antiviral drugs free of charge, regardless of health insurance or immigration status.
Antiviral drugs are administered over the course of several days in pill form. They are available to patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 symptoms who are at risk of progressing to severe coronavirus disease, including hospitalization or death.
Monoclonal antibody therapies are used to treat mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and children 12 years and older.
Antiviral pills must be prescribed by a health care provider and started within five days of symptoms to be effective. Monoclonal antibodies must be started within seven days.
“The available treatments are safe and effective and lower the risk of severe illness and hospitalization by nearly 90 percent,” Kaiser said.
You may be eligible for treatment if you:

Tested positive for COVID-19; and
Have symptoms of COVID-19, but not for more than 10 days; and
Are at high risk for developing severe illness from COVID-19.

To learn more about all treatment options, visit the County’s COVID-19 Treatment page.

1024,Board Votes to Oversee Grant Program to Harden Homes in Rural Communities,The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to establish a Home Hardening Program as part of a state pilot program to encourage homeowners to create fire-resistant homes.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-votes-to-oversee-grant-program-to-harden-homes-in-rural-communities/,2022-06-14T16:42:57-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to establish a Home Hardening Program as part of a state pilot program to encourage homeowners to create fire-resistant homes.
San Diego County is one of three counties selected to take part in the California Wildfire Mitigation Program which will fund the County initiative. In December, the Board accepted a $250,000 CAL FIRE/CAL OES grant for the development of the program. CAL FIRE/CAL OES has since approved the County’s nearly $25 million grant request to implement the 3-year program. The funding is expected in the fall which will allow the project to officially kick off.
“I am proud to serve on a Board that prioritizes fire prevention and preparedness, especially in the rural areas of my district that we know are most prone to wildfires,” said County Supervisor Joel Anderson. “Hardening homes and creating defensible spaces is crucial to saving lives, and I am grateful that three backcountry communities in District 2 will be given this opportunity for financial assistance.”
Two of the most effective measures that homeowners can take to protect themselves and their home from wildfire is maintaining defensible space and updating their home using fire resistant materials, also called “home hardening,” San Diego County Fire Chief Tony Mecham said.
The program will provide direct financial assistance, up to $40,000 dollars per home, to complete defensible space and home hardening retrofit measures. The program will help some 500 homeowners in the three-year pilot, he said.
“Homes that lack defensible space or were built long before the modernization of the fire code are far more vulnerable during a wildfire,” San Diego County Fire Director Jeff Collins said. “The initial phase takes place in one of our highest at-risk communities, where we intend to better safeguard a number of homes with fire resistant materials and critical vegetation clearing.”
Based on a detailed analysis of wildfire risk and vulnerability in the county, the program will assist the communities of Dulzura, Potrero and Campo, which are the highest areas of need, Mecham said.
County Fire has already started outreach in the community of Dulzura and is accepting applications for those in the 91917 ZIP Code. The goal is to help harden 25 homes by year’s end. In 2023, the program will expand to Potrero with a goal for another 100 homes in both communities. By 2024, they will add Campo and set a goal to harden 375 more homes in all three communities.
Defensible space, which includes trimming, cutting and clearing vegetation within 100 feet of a home or accessory unit, will be the first thing that the program will recommend for funding, if the home needs it.
After those measures, they will look at home modifications prioritized by vulnerability to embers, radiant heat, and flame. These retrofits may include replacing roofing with a noncombustible material, installing metal gutters, and upgrading to dual-paned windows with one pane of tempered glass.
Construction costs will be fully covered for households under 120% of the Area Median Income. As fire has no economic barriers, homeowners who earn above the 120% Area Median Income for household will still be able to participate in the program with a cost share of between 10% to 25% of the total project cost.

1025,Flu Virus Still Present in San Diego,"A total of 178 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported last week, a figure slightly lower when compared to flu totals identified in recent weeks, but far greater than the number of cases detected at this time in previous seasons.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208763,2022-06-15T10:38:02-07:00,"
A total of 178 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported last week, a figure slightly lower when compared to flu totals identified in recent weeks, but far greater than the number of cases detected at this time in previous seasons.
During the same week last year, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced three influenza cases, and during the past five seasons, there were an average of 16 flu infections for this time period.
Influenza-related deaths remain at seven for the 2021-2022 season.
“Flu cases spiked unusually late this flu season and it’s not too late to get your flu shot,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Anyone who is at a higher risk of developing complications from the flu should continue to take precautions.”
The flu vaccine is recommended for nearly everyone six months and older, but it is especially important for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

The latest Influenza Watch report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending June 11, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 4% of all visits (down from 5% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 178 (down from 193 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,851 (compared to 838 at the same time last season and a 11,747 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

1026,Recognizing the Signs of Elder Abuse,"On this World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the County of San Diego Aging & Independence Services is asking San Diegans to be on the lookout for signs of elder abuse.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/recognizing-the-signs-of-elder-abuse/,2022-06-15T14:00:02-07:00,"
On this World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, the County of San Diego Aging & Independence Services is asking San Diegans to be on the lookout for signs of elder abuse.
Elder abuse can take many shapes and forms, including physical abuse, neglect, financial abuse, abandonment, isolation, abduction, or other poor treatment that results in harm, pain, or mental suffering to an adult 60 years of age or older.
Each year, an estimated 1 in 10 older Americans become victims of elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation.
You can help by reporting suspected elder abuse or concerns about self-neglect. Make an anonymous report by calling the County’s Adult Protective Services (APS) at (800) 339-4661.
Local elder abuse report numbers have increased in recent years as the large percentage of Baby Boomers who live in the region reach their retirement years. Almost 23 percent of the County’s population is projected to be over age 65 by the year 2050.
Due to the large number of older residents, APS is receiving more requests for elder abuse investigations than ever before.
Additional Resources
In addition to responding to allegations of abuse and neglect, the County is proactively working to reduce the likelihood of abuse by addressing risk factors, including social isolation, and building community support.
One of the tools used to address risk factors is the Aging Roadmap, the region’s comprehensive plan for services to make the county a better place for residents as they age.
The plan includes alternative transportation options, opportunities for social engagement, training older adults to use technology, and providing additional supports to caregivers, such as respite care, to help manage burnout.
APS also has a specialized program called the Alzheimer’s Response Team, which helps older adults with dementia access support services when they are in crisis so that they are less likely to end up in the emergency department or in law enforcement custody. Originally created as a pilot project in East County, the initiative was recently expanded to serve all areas of the county.
For more information on Adult Protective Services and elder abuse resources, visit the APS website. You can also get general information about programs and services for older adults and caregivers on the Aging & Independence Services website.

1027,Two Presumptive Cases of Monkeypox Identified in San Diego County,"The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has identified two presumptive cases of monkeypox, that must be verified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208760,2022-06-15T14:14:12-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has identified two probable cases of monkeypox that must be verified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These would be the first cases to be found in San Diego County.
The two cases are unrelated to each other, but both individuals recently traveled internationally. Although symptomatic, they are doing well and are not hospitalized. Both individuals are isolated from others.
“We have seen an increasing number of cases of the monkeypox virus across the world and in the U.S. in recent weeks, so our public health department was prepared for possible local cases,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Overall, the risk of monkeypox to the general population remains very low.”
Both cases are currently listed as probable as all suspected cases of monkeypox must receive final confirmation from the CDC. Confirmation is expected in the coming days.
“The arrival of these probable cases in our region is not a surprise, but rather has been expected,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “Our public health leaders are confident there is very little risk of exposure to the majority of County residents.”
About Monkeypox
Monkeypox is a viral infection that can spread through contact with body fluids, sores on the body of someone who has monkeypox, or shared items (e.g., clothing and bedding) that have been contaminated with fluids from sores of a person with monkeypox.
The disease can also spread between people through saliva or respiratory droplets, typically between people in a close setting. Although monkeypox is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, it can be transmitted during sex through skin-to-skin and other intimate contact, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
The virus is not known to linger in the air and is not transmitted during short periods of shared airspace.
Cases of monkeypox have previously been identified in travelers from, or residents of, countries in western and central Africa, where monkeypox is considered to be endemic. Since May 2022, monkeypox cases have been reported in several non-endemic countries, including the United States.  No deaths have been reported.
Monkeypox Symptoms
Symptoms of monkeypox are similar to, but milder than, the signs and symptoms of smallpox. They include:

Fever
Headache
Muscle aches
Backache
Swollen lymph nodes
Chills
Exhaustion

A rash usually develops within 1 to 3 days after the appearance of fever. The rash often begins on the face and then spreads to other parts of the body.
Most people who develop monkeypox experience symptoms 7 to 14 days (and up to 21 days) after exposure.
The majority of people who become infected with monkeypox have a mild illness that improves without treatment over 2 to 4 weeks. Monkeypox is contagious and can spread to others until scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed.
What People Should Do
Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms of monkeypox, including unusual rashes or lesions, should contact a healthcare provider right away. Cover the area of the rash with clothing, wear a mask and avoid skin-to-skin or close contact with others until the symptoms are medically evaluated.

Students at the County Probation Department’s new Youth Transition Campus are preparing for a woodworking exhibition Friday, June 17. Youth will get to show off their projects built over the last year in Career and Technical Education classes at the new Kearny Mesa campus and at the East Mesa Juvenile Detention Facility.
The students have created Adirondack chairs, an entertainment center, a baby crib, a sideboard and two tables. The projects will be presented by the youth and then each item will be sold to raise money for tools and materials to be used for future students.
The Career and Technical Education program started five years ago, and teacher Alex Long only accepts youth who have the best behavior into it.  The students learn construction skills and how to be professional in their actions.
“When they are released from here, they actually have something that they can take and go get a job,” Long says. “We change the way they think, and the way they behave, and who they hang out with. And I think they get a real-world chance to go and start a different life than the path they were on before.”
After successfully completing the class, students have a guaranteed job interview with a local company, Long says.
The items created in the woodshop are sold on the site ProjectBirdland.com.

1029,COVID Vaccines for Children Under 5 Expected Soon,"If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Western States committee approve Moderna’s vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years and Pfizer’s for children ages 6 months to 4 years, San Diego County children in those age groups will soon be able to get vaccinated at their pediatrician’s office, community clinics and some retail pharmacies.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208781,2022-06-16T18:26:04-07:00,"
Children under 5 years of age are the only group that is not eligible to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
The situation is likely to change soon if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Western States committee approve Moderna’s vaccine for children ages 6 months to 5 years and Pfizer’s for children ages 6 months to 4 years.
If that occurs, San Diego County children in those age groups will be able to get vaccinated at their pediatrician’s office, community clinics and some retail pharmacies.
“While children have not been as susceptible to COVID-19, it’s important that they, too, are vaccinated to keep them from getting sick and passing the virus to others,” said Wilma J. Wooten. M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Some parents have been eagerly anticipating the COVID vaccine for their younger kids. They should make an appointment to get them vaccinated as soon as possible.”
Smaller Doses for Younger Kids
The vaccines for children this age would be given in much smaller doses. The Pfizer vaccine would be given in three shots, each containing one tenth of an adult dose. The first two doses would be given three weeks apart and the final shot at least three months later.
The Moderna vaccine, which currently is only available for adults, is also likely to be approved for two more age groups: children between 6 and 17 years of age and those under 6. The Moderna shot for kids under 6 is a two-dose series, given about four weeks apart. Each dose contains one quarter of the adult dose.
Both the Pfizer and Moderna shots for kids under 6 are given with smaller needles and, most times, it is administered in the leg.
Everyone 5 years and older can get a vaccine and boosters at no cost. Parental consent is required for all eligible minors to be vaccinated.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 2.97 million or 94.4% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.63 million or 83.6%.
Boosters administered: 1,358,992 or 58.7% of 2,316,581 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Three additional deaths were reported since the last report on June 9. The region’s total is 5,318.
Of those three additional deaths, two were men and one was a woman. They died between June 9, 2022 and June 11, 2022; the three deaths occurred in the past week.
Two of the people who died were 80 years or older and one was in their 70s.
Two of the people who died were fully vaccinated and one was not.
All three had underlying medical conditions

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

4,003 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (June 13 – June 15, 2022). The region’s total is now 813,035.
9,672cases were reported in the past week (June 9 through June 15) compared to 10,370 infections identified the previous week (June 2-June 8).

1030,County Identifies Third Probable Case of hMPXV,"The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has identified an additional probable case of hMPXV, also known as human monkeypox, bringing the total probable case count in the region to three.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-identifies-third-probable-case-of-hmpxv/,2022-06-17T16:51:24-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency has identified an additional probable case of hMPXV, also known as human monkeypox, bringing the total probable case count in the region to three.
All probable cases must be verified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and that process can take several days. The two prior probable cases reported by the County on Wednesday have not been verified by the CDC yet.
County health officials say this most recent case has no connection or relation to the first two probable cases, but like the other two, the individual also recently traveled internationally.
Currently, the individual is in isolation and although symptomatic, the patient is doing well and is not hospitalized.
“All three individuals with probable cases of hMPXV here in the region are doing well and are managing their symptoms in home isolation,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most individuals who become infected experience mild to moderate symptoms and the risk of contracting the virus remains very low for the general population.”
Going forward, the County will provide weekly updates on the hMPXV situation in the region on Fridays. The County’s hMPXV website will be updated by 5 p.m. each Friday, excluding holidays.
As of Friday, the CDC has confirmed 113 hMPXV cases in 20 states and the District of Columbia, with California (24), New York (21) and Illinois (15) seeing the largest number of cases.
About hMPXV
hMPXV, or human monkeypox is a viral infection that can spread through contact with body fluids, sores on the body of someone who has hMPXV, or shared items (e.g., clothing and bedding) that have been contaminated with fluids from sores of a person with hMPXV.

1031,County Invites Public to Events Celebrating Pollinator Week,"Birds do it, bees do it, and without them and all the other pollinators in our world, life as we know it wouldn’t exist ― no flowers, no food, no terrestrial ecosystems. That’s why the County of San Diego's Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM) wants to help people celebrate National Pollinator Week!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208796,2022-06-21T12:37:31-07:00,"
Birds do it, bees do it, and without them and all the other pollinators in our world, life as we know it wouldn’t exist ― no flowers, no food, no terrestrial ecosystems.
That’s why the County of San Diego and its Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM) want to help the public celebrate National Pollinator Week through June 26!
Starting Tuesday, AWM will have an interactive display up for visitors from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. in their office lobby, located at 9325 Hazard Way in San Diego, where people can learn more about pollinators.
At 10 a.m. Friday June 24, the department and master gardeners from the University of California Cooperative Extension will host a pollinator presentation for the public at the Demonstration Garden at the County Operations Center.
And Friday night, the County Administration Center will be lit to honor the most famous pollinators of all ― bees ― and their keepers!
National Pollinator Week is held every year the world over to support pollinator health. The U.S. Senate’s unanimous approval and designation of a week in June as National Pollinator Week was a needed step to addressing the issue of declining pollinator populations. The week gives scientists and the public a special week to celebrate pollinators and spread the word about what we all can do to protect them.
Roughly 75% of all flowering plant species need animal pollinators to reproduce.
AWM supports local farmers and the County’s $1.8 billion agriculture industry by protecting native plant habitat for pollinators including bees, butterflies, bats, moths and flies through programs that help prevent the introduction of invasive plants, pests and diseases.
In addition, AWM’s Apiary Program helps ensure the health and safety of managed bee colonies by inspecting apiaries and providing outreach about the importance of pollinators.
You can help pollinators by sharing Pollinator Week on your social media, building native bee houses, planting pollinator habitat in your yard and many other ways. For more information about how you can help, please visit pollinator.org, UC Cooperative Extension and AWM’s Apiary Program, or call AWM’s Bee Hotline at 1-800-200-BEES (2337).

1032,Final Flu Update of 2021-2022 Influenza Season,"Flu cases continued to decline in the region during the past week, with 147 new cases being recorded, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported Wednesday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/final-flu-update-of-2021-2022-influenza-season/,2022-06-22T12:14:13-07:00,"
Flu cases continued to decline in the region during the past week, with 147 new cases being recorded, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported Wednesday.
Due to the continued decline in cases, the County will cease to publish its weekly Influenza Watch and written articles on County News Center. The County will release a final report with total case numbers for the 2021-2022 season later this summer.
So far this year, there have been 3,999 cases of influenza and seven deaths. At the same time last year, there had been 848 cases and two deaths.
“We saw a lot more flu cases this season when compared to last, as well as a late-season surge in influenza activity,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While cases are trending down at this time, seasonal influenza vaccinations are still available and encouraged, especially for those at higher risk of adverse outcomes.”
The latest Influenza Watch report from the County Health and Human Services Agency shows the following for the week ending June 18, 2022:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 5% of all visits (compared to 4% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 147 (down from 178 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 3,999 (compared to 842 at the same time last season and a 11,758 prior 5-year average during the same week).
Influenza-related deaths reported to date: seven (compared to two last season).

Tips to Prevent the Flu
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

The smallest of San Diego County’s small businesses ― from dog walkers to tutors, sidewalk vendors and everything in between ― now have more time to apply for a free $2,500 County grant.
The deadline for “microbusinesses” hurt by COVID-19 to apply for the second round of $2,500 grants has been extended from June 24 to July 15.
The grants are partly funded by the California Office of the Small Business Advocate. A first round of grant applications closed in March.
County supervisors unanimously approved in February giving out 1,550 of the $2,500 grants, totaling $3.8 million, to COVID-19-affected businesses earning less than $50,000 a year with fewer than five full-time employees.
The grants are being given out with a special emphasis on helping businesses run by people and groups that have historically faced barriers to obtaining capital, including women, minorities, veterans, limited English speakers, businesses in low- to mid-income rural areas and people without documentation.
Microbusinesses may be eligible for a $2,500 grant if their business:

Was started before Dec. 31, 2019, is the owner’s primary source of revenue, and is currently operating or has a plan to reopen
Generated less than $50,000 in revenue in the 2019 tax year
Currently has five or fewer full-time employees and had five or fewer employees in 2019, 2020 and 2021
Was significantly impacted by COVID-19
Has not previously received any grant money from the California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant Program

The grants are available in all five County supervisorial districts and outreach is occurring in all districts.
Businesses that could benefit include home operations like pet sitters, shoppers, cleaners and home health care workers, and sidewalk vendors like food cart operators.
The grant application page can be reached either through the County’s Microbusiness COVID-19 Relief Grant Program webpage or directly at the Small Business Development Center’s website.
The County has contracted with Southwestern College’s Small Business Development Center to collect and process online applications and to conduct outreach along with the Asian Business Association of San Diego, the Logan Heights Community Development Corporation, the South County Economic Development Council and the San Diego East County Economic Development Council.
The County’s grants must be distributed in 2022. If there is grant money left after the first and second round, additional application periods will be held.

1036,County Breaks Ground for First Affordable Housing Development on Surplus Property,"In a first for the County, officials broke ground on a surplus property that will transform an empty lot into a site for low-income affordable housing.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208823,2022-06-23T14:48:34-07:00,"
In a first for the County, officials broke ground on a surplus property that will transform an empty lot into a site for low-income affordable housing.
Thursday’s groundbreaking marks the start of construction for the Levant Street Cottages in the Linda Vista neighborhood of the City of San Diego. The site once housed a County Child Welfare Services building.
The cottages will go up on a 4.57-acre plot of land and include 127 independent living and affordable senior housing units expected to house 150 people. At least 20% of the units will go toward seniors with 50% or less of the area median income. The rest will go to seniors with 60% or less.
The County is working with Wakeland Housing and Development, and San Diego Kind Corporations to develop the property. The developers will lease the land for a $1 a year and pay an annual $10,000 administrative payment to the County. The housing units will remain affordable for 70 years.
The San Diego Housing Commission provided 70 project-based vouchers. The state provided $23 million in tax credits and $19 million in Multifamily Housing Program funds.
Construction on the Levant Street Cottages is scheduled for completion in early 2024.
Since 2017, the County has invested $175 million toward creating affordable housing in the region. Seven other excess County properties are slated for affordable housing.

1037,"COVID-19 Vaccines, Boosters Strongly Recommended for Older San Diegans","  Vaccination Progress: Received at least one shot: Nearly 2.98 million or 94.6% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.

COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters help to prevent severe illness and hospitalization, especially in older adults over the age of 50.
However, thousands of older San Diegans have yet to receive all the recommended doses and boosters.
The County Health and Human Services Agency conducted an analysis local COVID-19 vaccination data and found that as of June 20, 2022:

89,647 San Diegans ages 50 and older or 8.42% of the estimated population in this age group were not fully vaccinated.
352,732 residents who are 50 and older (33.1%) were fully vaccinated but have not gotten their first booster dose, even though 295,990 (83.9%) are eligible.
Of the 711,749 San Diegans age 50 and older who received a first booster dose, 71.3% (507,398) are missing a second booster.
Of the 507,398 people who are missing a second booster, 91.9% (466,232) are eligible to receive one, which may be administered at least four months after the first.

“Because immunity from the COVID-19 vaccine wanes over time, boosters help to give you added protection against the virus and its strains, both in terms of reducing infections and severe outcomes,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “People over age 50 are more susceptible to severe illness and complications from COVID-19. If you are eligible, you should get the recommended boosters as soon as possible to protect yourself and those around you.”
Furthermore, of all San Diegans who are fully vaccinated and eligible for their first booster, 42.7% have not received one. Currently, there are 2,384,778 people, 5 years and older, who are eligible for their first booster.
Everyone 6 months and older can get COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. Boosters are also available for people 5 years and older. Parental consent is required for all eligible minors to be vaccinated.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Nearly 2.98 million or 94.6% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.63 million or 83.7%.
Boosters administered: 1,366,219 or 57.3% of 2,384,778 eligible San Diegans.

Deaths:

14 additional deaths were reported since the last report on June 16. The region’s total is 5,332.
Of the 14 additional deaths, eight were men and six were women. They died between Jan. 25 and June 21, 2022; three deaths occurred in the past two weeks.

1040,County Adopts $7.36 Billion Budget,The San Diego County’s Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a $7.36 billion 2022-23 budget Tuesday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208855,2022-06-28T15:21:08-07:00,"
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved a $7.36 billion 2022-23 budget Tuesday.
The new budget builds on commitments to address mental health, homelessness, equity, racial justice and climate change, while upholding essential public safety, land use and social services.
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher thanked the public for its input, feedback and participation in numerous budget meetings and hearings. Citing the County’s motto, “the noblest motive is the public good,” Fletcher said the Board recognized its fundamental role in keeping the community safe from crime and emergencies like wildfires, but that the County was also making record investments in other essential services.
“I believe that our fiscal year 2022-23 budget is a reflection of values,” Fletcher said. “At the end of the day, that’s what budgets are. They’re not just buckets of money. They are a reflection of values and prioritizations and recognizing the needs of the community.”
The $7.36 billion budget the Board adopted Tuesday is $208 million larger than the budget the County recommended in May. It is 1.8%, larger than the County’s 2021-22 budget.
Some additions to the recommended budget that increased the final spending plan included added money for labor costs based on negotiations; for six additional capital improvement projects; to buy a twin-engine firefighting helicopter; and for a pilot program to retrofit, harden and create defensible for homes in high fire-risk areas. There is also additional spending for new vehicles and added staff for law enforcement.
The final adopted budget makes investments in several key areas:
Mental Health and Substance Use Support
The new budget adds $71.8 million and 115 new positions to help continue County efforts to transform its behavioral health system, from crisis response to prevention, continuous care to keep people connected and healthy.
The budget continues to improve services to help people with mental health challenges and substance use disorders, focusing on those who have historically suffered silently, including people experiencing homelessness and youth.
The budget supports the County’s Mobile Crisis Response Teams that send mental health experts rather than law enforcement to respond to people in crisis when appropriate.
The budget also includes a wide variety of resources to match the right type of care with the person in need — things such as recuperative care, school-based services, services for foster youth, people in long-term care services and the LGBTQ community.
Homelessness and Housing
To continue efforts to make significant progress to end homelessness, the budget combines mental health and substance use support with investments in innovative housing.
Increased investments include $11.9 million from one-time stimulus funds to develop affordable housing to reduce homelessness.,
As part of the new budget, in March, County Supervisors approved making an additional $10 million available to cities to buy shelters and places to stay for people experiencing homelessness. One recent partnership with the Lucky Duck Foundation and the City of San Diego will result in a 150-bed emergency shelter opening this summer.
Another $3 million will be used to create more affordable housing for residents by waiving permit fees to encourage building accessory dwelling units. In addition, $810,000 will be spent to create an inclusionary zoning ordinance that will require new development to include housing that people at or below median income levels can afford.
Justice Reform
The new budget continues County programs to shift its justice system toward prevention, rehabilitation and training to help people avoid justice involvement and successfully come back to their communities after custody. This includes the Alternatives to Incarceration initiative. The initiative supports alternatives to jail and provides services and care, including mental health and sobering services, for people who don’t pose a public safety threat.
More than $130 million is invested in health care services in the County’s jails to help offenders.
Roughly $6.2 million will be spent on a Youth Development Academy to help young people who have committed serious offenses by giving them more intensive, longer-term behavioral health, rehabilitative and skill-building services to help them come back to our communities.
County Probation will use $1 million toward de-escalation training for their staff, supporting the young people they supervise.
The Juvenile Diversion Initiative and Transitional Age Youth Diversion program in the District Attorney’s office will be bolstered with $2.4 million, to give juveniles the opportunity to accept services and counseling instead of prosecution.
The Public Defender’s Office will add $21.8 million and 90 staff to defend clients, represent immigrants and the indigent in our neighborhoods, and improve transitions back into communities.
The District Attorney will use $3.5 million and add 18 positions to expand services to victims of crime, including the South Bay Center for Community Resiliency and Trauma Recovery, and a resentencing program.
Equity and Access
The new budget also continues efforts to weave equity into all County programs and services.
The County Office of Equity and Racial Justice has implemented its new Budget Equity Assessment Tool that helps County departments prioritize services and allocations with equity in mind. The tool uses a series of questions to better understand how allocations affect historically marginalized vulnerable communities, those who are low-income or those who have historically and currently suffer from inequality.
The tool also incorporates community engagement, an important cornerstone of the County’s operations that will be expanded in this budget to provide opportunities for all community members to play meaningful roles in discussions and decision-making.
Increased translation and interpretation services will provide greater access to services and information.
A new Office of Sustainability and Environmental Justice is funded with $3.6 million and work to make sure all communities have the same protection from health hazards.
And the San Diego County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement will serve as the central location for education and resources for employers and their workers. It will undertake research and data analysis regarding worker issues and pursue enforcement measures to protect workers.
Sustainability and Fighting Climate Change
Climate change is already affecting San Diego County communities and the County is working hard to address the issue through reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing sustainability.
More than $25 million will be invested to cut greenhouse gas emissions in our unincorporated communities, including $1 million to support electric vehicle charging stations.
Nearly $60 million will be spent on other environmental improvements, including $40 million to address stormwater issues, $16.3 million on the Multiple Species Conservation Program and $3.4 million to improve the Tijuana River Valley.
Green building and solar energy will be promoted by waiving an estimated $2.1 million in permit fees. More than 3,500 trees intended to trap more than 178,000 pounds of carbon dioxide a year will be planted around the county.
Greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced — while equitable access to health care is boosted — by allocating $2 million to buy two additional Live Well on Wheels vehicles and a new mobile public health lab that can bring services to residents rather than requiring them to travel individually to health offices.
Supporting Families
This budget also includes additional funding and positions to focus on the day-to-day needs of residents at home and at work, especially the most vulnerable.
In-Home Supportive Services for older adults and people who are blind or disabled was boosted by 60 positions. Another 100 new positions bolster essential services including CalFresh and Medi-Cal, to help people get the food and health care they need. Child Welfare Services will add 100 new positions to increase emergency response support, and quality placement for children in care, and to strengthen prevention services and continue improving connecting families to community-based services.
More than $30 million received through the America Rescue Plan Act of 2021 will continue to support the Board of Supervisors’ framework for using the funds, including mental health services for young people and support for renters and nutrition programs.
The County’s new Office of Economic Development & Government Affairs will foster inclusive economic growth, provide opportunities in arts and culture, and administer grant programs that focus on nonprofits and community-based organizations.
And the County’s new Office of Evaluation, Performance and Analytics will use data and analytics to better inform decisions that impact our communities and improve service delivery.
Enhancing Communities and Keeping Them Safe
The budget also invests in safety and quality of life.
It includes $2.9 million for land for a future public safety facility located at Interstate 15 and State Route 76, and $250,000 to start plans and design for a new Jacumba fire station.
In addition, the San Diego County Fire Protection District is adding $2.2 million to protect communities and reduce community wildfire risk in unincorporated areas through roadside vegetation management and creating fire breaks.
Public Health Services will add 71 new positions to continue to strengthen its overall ability to protect our residents’ health.
The budget will spend $550,000 for new and expanded County parks, including Calavo, Star Ranch, Lindo Lake, Park Circle and the Waterfront Park. And a Food Access Initiative to help create community gardens will be funded with $1 million.
Community Engagement
The County and Board of Supervisors courted the public’s input in forming the budget.
The County held virtual community budget meetings in each of the Board of Supervisor’s five districts; conducted public hearings June 13 and an evening hearing June 16. It also created an Operational Plan website and offered people the chance to comment online throughout the public hearing process.

1041,"GALLERY: One Safe Place, a New Family Justice Center, Will Support Crime Victims in North County","The District Attorney, County leaders, health professionals and law enforcement celebrated the upcoming opening of One Safe Place in San Marcos with a ribbon cutting Thursday.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208859,2022-06-28T16:12:41-07:00,"
The District Attorney, County leaders, health professionals and law enforcement celebrated the upcoming opening of One Safe Place in San Marcos. One Safe Place is a family justice center created to support victims of domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse, human trafficking, and violent loss in northern San Diego County. The new center will open its doors to the public on July 5.
Child and adult victims of abuse and their families can go to One Safe Place and receive acute crisis-care, forensic medical exams, advocacy, counseling and therapy, legal services such as restraining orders, connections to a safe shelter and housing, long-term mentoring, workforce readiness, clothing, and educational opportunities all under one roof.
































“One Safe Place is made up of caring, dedicated professionals who are all coming together to protect victims from violence and abuse and prevent harm,” said San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan, whose office built and is administrating the facility. “Opening this facility has been a passion project of mine and a priority for our office. We heard the voices of victims who struggle to regain their safety, heal from trauma, find shelter and economic stability and we responded with One Safe Place in the North County where everyone is welcome, and people can find hope, healing and justice. We couldn’t have done it without our partners and the tremendous support from our County Board of Supervisors and our community.”
Data from recent years shows north county residents are experiencing specific types of crime at a disproportionate rate compared to the rest of San Diego County according to the District Attorney’s Office.
While existing service providers deliver excellent support in the region, there is little interconnectivity, and providers often operate in silos, rather than under one umbrella of victim care. Co-located professionals at One Safe Place include victim advocates, nurses, medical professionals, counselors, attorneys, housing navigators, childcare professionals, work-readiness coaches, law enforcement and more. One Safe Place is a multi-agency service center that focuses on reducing the number of times victims tell their story, the number of places victims must go for help, and increasing access to services and support for victims and their children.
“One Safe Place will literally be a life-saver,” said San Diego County Supervisor Jim Desmond. “Many victims of violence and abuse feel they don’t have anywhere to turn and continue to suffer. One Safe Place will interrupt the cycle of abuse and empower people to break free to become thriving members of society again.”
More than 70 community agencies will partner with One Safe Place. A primary partner is Palomar Health and its nationally accredited child advocacy center. Palomar Health is also placing nurses at One Safe Place who are experienced in performing forensic medical exams on individuals who have experienced intimate partner violence or other types of abuse.
One Safe Place is part of the Family Justice Center Alliance. The Family Justice Center model has been identified as a best practice in the field of domestic violence intervention and prevention services by the United States Department of Justice. This model began in the City of San Diego in 2002 under the leadership of then City Attorney Casey Gwinn. Community leaders say it was time to regionalize this model to serve the North County and say more such centers may be established in San Diego County in the future.
One Safe Place is located at 1050 Los Vallecitos Boulevard, San Marcos, CA  92069. Individuals can contact One Safe Place at gethope@OneSafePlaceNorth.org or at 760-290-3690. One Safe Place will be open to walk-ins beginning July 5. The center will be open Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and Saturday from 8:00 a.m. to noon.

1042,County Adding New Warning Category to Inform Beachgoers,"On July 1, 2022, the County of San Diego will begin using a new beach water-safety category and signs at local beaches in its continuing efforts to educate and protect the public’s health. The new “warning” category will join the existing advisory and closure categories.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208880,2022-06-29T09:19:56-07:00,"
On July 1, 2022, the County of San Diego will begin using a new beach water-safety category and signs at local beaches in its continuing efforts to educate and protect the public’s health.
The new “warning” category will join the existing advisory and closure categories. Warning signs will tell beachgoers that beach water may contain sewage and may cause illness if people come into contact with it. With transboundary south swell conditions expected this Fourth of July weekend, warning signs may be posted at South County beaches.
Here are the category differences:
Advisory Category
An advisory sign is posted for awareness for beachgoers when test results exceed State health standards, but no known sewage conditions exist, and water is not moving from south to north. When an advisory is posted, it means people have a higher chance of getting sick based on testing levels of contaminated water.
New Warning Category
A warning sign will be posted for beachgoers when testing exceeds State health standards AND south swell (transboundary flow) ocean conditions are pushing waters from the south to the north. A warning indicates that even though sewage impacts are not verified, sewage may be in the water due to the south swell  conditions. Warnings will help people make their own decisions about whether to enter recreational waters. Previously, test results and a south swell would have resulted in a beach closure.
Closure Category
Beach closures are issued if there are known sewage impacts. This means it is known for sure there is sewage in the water, and to protect the public’s health, State law requires the closure of affected beaches. Closures follow reported sewage spills, or when the Tijuana River is flowing and reaching recreational waters, or when County environmental health experts verify sewage odors or water discoloration reported by lifeguards, beach managers, and/or surfers/swimmers.
The new warning category will be implemented through the end of September to evaluate how well it serves the public and our communities.
No Signs
No signs posted? No need to worry, just enjoy the beach! 
County officials encourage residents and visitors to learn more about water quality conditions and risks by using the QR code on posted beach signs or by visiting sdbeachinfo.com for more information.
In May, the County became the first coastal county in the United States to start using rapid, DNA-based water quality testing technology (ddPCR) that produces faster results.  This technique came after nearly 10 years of testing, pilot programs, and working with federal, state and local agencies.
You can learn more about each of these beach water quality management categories on DEHQ’s popular “Check in Before You Get In” website.

1043,"Take Care to Secure, Calm Your Pets During Fireworks","Every year, dozens of dogs end up at shelters after Fourth of July fireworks shows.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208888,2022-06-29T11:29:26-07:00,"
Every year, dozens of dogs end up at shelters after Fourth of July fireworks shows.
If you’re lucky, your dog doesn’t react to the explosions and shrill whistles of fireworks set off to celebrate the holiday. But for some dogs and other pets, the sounds can be terrifying due to their sensitive ears.
Dogs kept outdoors or that are unleashed often escape yards in a panic, digging under, breaking through, or jumping over fences. In extreme cases, they can even break through window screens, gates or screen doors from inside to run. They are then at risk for running into traffic, getting lost, or even being attacked by other animals.
At this point, their best bet is to be picked up by a neighbor or an animal control officer for safekeeping until the owner can reclaim their pet.
“We suggest if your dog has a problem with loud noises or if you are not sure how your dog will react, it should be kept inside your home in the most noise-insulating room available to keep it secure and as calm as possible,” said County Animal Services Director Kelly Campbell. “As a backup plan, in case it still manages to run away, we recommend microchipping your pet.”
Pets that are microchipped and licensed are reunited with their owners much quicker than those that are not. If your dog is not microchipped, residents in the unincorporated areas can get their dogs microchipped for a $20 fee at the County’s two shelters in Carlsbad and Bonita by calling (619) 767-2675 for an appointment.
Some additional tips on how to protect your pet this Fourth of July:

Stay home with your dogs or have someone they like stay with them.
Do not take your pet to fireworks displays. Keep your pets indoors in a sheltered, quiet area.
Some dogs become destructive when frightened so remove dangerous objects your pet may chew.
If you can’t stay with them, leave a television or radio playing at normal volume to keep your pet company while you’re away.
Never leave pets outside unattended, even in a fenced yard. In their fear, pets that normally wouldn’t leave the yard may escape and get lost.
If you know your pet is seriously distressed by loud noises like thunder, consult your veterinarian to see if anxiety-relieving medication is appropriate.
Do not leave your pet in the car. With only hot air to breathe inside a car, your pet can suffer serious health effects, even death, within minutes.
If you are walking your dog near fireworks displays, be sure your pet is secured on a leash in case it tries to bolt.

If you find a lost pet in the unincorporated area of the County after the fireworks, call County Animal Services’ 24-hour emergency dispatch number at (619) 236-2341 so the animal can be cared for at the shelter. If you lose your pet, check the department’s lost and found page online.
If you see your dog is at County Animal Services, you can pick up your pet starting at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, July 5.

1044,"Storefront Model Improves Access for Food, Medical, Other Assistance","The County Health and Human Services Agency Centre City Family Resource Center is now one of the busiest locations where residents can get access to food, medical and other assistance programs and services.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208903,2022-06-30T11:21:09-07:00,"
Easier access and shorter wait times.
That is what has led the County Health and Human Services Agency Centre City Family Resource Center (FRC) to become one of the busiest locations where residents can get access to food, medical and other assistance programs and services.
With an overhaul born of COVID-19 necessity, the FRC at 1255 Imperial Ave. has been remodeled to include four walk-up windows where people can apply for and find out if they qualify for Self-Sufficiency Services such as CalFresh (food stamps), Medi-Cal and General Relief programs.
These services are now available in a one-stop storefront, in what was formerly an outside eating area at the Metropolitan Transit System building. Prior to the remodel, customers had to go into the building, be screened by security by going through a metal detector and take the elevator to the fifth floor where the rest of the FRC was located.
“With these improvements the County is providing easier access and faster service to our customers, most of whom are vulnerable residents without a stable place to live and who are struggling with a mental illness and/or substance use issues,” said Self-Sufficiency Services Director Rick Wanne.
Since the storefront opened about 18 months ago, it has received over 110,000 customer visits, averaging approximately 250 per day with a typical wait time of less than 15 minutes. Additionally, the FRC storefront has issued more than 24,000 electronic benefit transfer or EBT cards.
Quickly established 18 months ago to provide in-person services to the public during COVID-19, this new way of providing walk-up, triage, and quick transaction services has proven so successful that the County is exploring plans to implement this model at the other 11 FRCs.
“We expect this service delivery model to effectively support our customers at all locations moving forward,” said Wanne.
Currently, there are 367,000 San Diegans receiving CalFresh benefits, 42,000 on CalWorks, 967,000 getting Medi-Cal and 3,000 receiving General Relief assistance.
Residents can apply for Self-Sufficiency programs online, at a County Family Resource Center or via the Customer Service Call Center at (866) 262-9881.

1045,"Lower COVID-19 Vaccination Rates Seen for Children, Teens","Fewer San Diego County children and teens are getting vaccinated against COVID-19 compared to the overall eligible population, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208909,2022-06-30T18:24:59-07:00,"
Fewer San Diego County children and teens are getting vaccinated against COVID-19 compared to the overall eligible population, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Local data through June 29, 2022, shows the following:

182,035 or 76% of the 239,401 San Diegans ages 12 through 17 have completed a primary vaccine series.
114,748 or 36.9% of the 310,643 children between 5 and 11 years of age have received the primary vaccine series.
Of the 207,723 children 6 months through 4 years of age, only 3,323 or 1.6% are partially vaccinated. The percentage is expected to be lower because COVID-19 vaccines for this age group were only recently recommended.

In comparison, 83.8% of the overall population eligible for COVID-19 vaccines has completed a primary vaccine series.
“COVID-19 vaccines not only protect the people who get them, but also those around them,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Children are not immune to COVID-19 and they can still develop serious complications. Parents should make sure their children get all the recommended doses of the vaccine.”
When it comes to COVID-19 boosters, percentages are even lower in children and teens ages 5 through 17.
A total of 161,561 San Diegans ages 12 through 17 are eligible for a booster, but only 64,147 or 39.7% have received one. Only 12.2% or 10,365 of local children ages 5 through 11 have received a booster, although 84,970 now qualify for the extra dose. In comparison, 57.3% of 2,394,907 eligible San Diegans has received a booster. Boosters have not been yet recommended for children 6 months through 4 years of age.
“COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters help to prevent severe illness. If you have not gotten all the recommended doses of the vaccine, do it now,” Wooten said.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Over 2.98 million or 94.7% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.63 million or 83.8%.
Boosters administered: 1,372,612 or 57.3% of 2,394,907 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Nine additional deaths were reported since the last report on June 23. The region’s total is 5,341.
Of the nine additional deaths, five were women and four were men. They died between Jan. 31 and June 22, 2022; two deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Four of the people who died were 80 years or older, three were in their 70s and two were in their 60s.
Six were fully vaccinated and three were not.
Eight had underlying medical conditions and one had medical history pending.

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

5,096 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (June 27 to June 29, 2022). The region’s total is now 834,049.
11,019 cases were reported in the past week (June 23 through June 29) compared to 9,673 infections identified the previous week (June 16 through June 22).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 42.01 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 25.06 for fully vaccinated people and 88.53 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
8,332 tests were reported to the County on June 25, and the percentage of new positive cases was 12.7% (Data through June 25).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through June 25, is 12%.

1046,County Kicks Off Experience the Outdoors Program,"A new initiative to spread the word about County parks, teach people about the outdoors, share fun, and promote equity, inclusion, accessibility and opportunity, kicks off Friday night with a Summer Movie at the Park at the Waterfront Park.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208907,2022-07-01T08:38:10-07:00,"
A new initiative to spread the word about County parks, teach people about the outdoors, share fun, and promote equity, inclusion, accessibility and opportunity, kicks off Friday night with a Summer Movie at the Park at the Waterfront Park.
The “Experience the Outdoors Program” will be an energetic, monthly drive with up to 75 free events scheduled through June 2023 — 37 through December — to increase public awareness of County regional parks and highlight activities and services available to everyone.
The program will be built around three separate parks campaigns: the RAD Regional Parks Event Series, the Ride-on Mountain Biking Challenge and the Parks 101: First-Timer Series.
The RAD Regional Parks Event Series will include dozens of events at 12 different County parks, including Summer Movies in the Park like Friday’s Waterfront Park showing of “Free Guy,” hikes, fitness classes, ghost and historic tours, bird and raptor presentations, celebrations, festivals and family fun days.
The Ride-on Mountain Biking Challenge will include eight monthly meetup events, six this year, that will let riders take on eight beginner, intermediate and advanced trails at six different parks. Registrants can earn custom “Ride On” socks and a collectible sticker. Attending the meetups is not mandatory; anyone who visits a featured trail can request a sticker at the ranger station. The program was developed by County Parks with the San Diego Mountain Biking Association with the support of REI San Diego, the San Diego County Parks Society and other organizations.
The Parks 101: First Timer Series is starting with 13 scheduled events, six in 2022, that will teach participants outdoor essentials under the direction of County staff, including things like how to hike and bike safely, how to camp, fish, kayak and even rock climb. The program is designed specifically for people who, for various reasons, are beginners to outdoor experiences.
Some of the promotions for the events will include waiving County day-use fees, waived camping fees (for campout events), translation services and providing participants with free equipment to use for events that require specialized equipment.

1048,County Calls for Vigilance as COVID-19 Cases and Hospitalizations Increase,"The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is seeing significant recent spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new cases, prompting officials to call for more vigilance.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208930,2022-07-07T18:16:35-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is seeing significant recent spikes in COVID-19 hospitalizations and new cases, prompting officials to call for more vigilance.
Lab-confirmed coronavirus cases remain near 10,000 per week, but it is important to note that this figure does not include antigen tests many people now take at home. Results from home tests are not tracked by the County and those that do get reported are listed in the probable case count, not the lab-confirmed case counts published by the County.
The County has also seen an increase in reinfections, San Diegans who have tested positive for COVID-19 several times throughout the pandemic. National data shows that prior infection does not necessarily prevent reinfection with some of the newer virus variants.
Hospitalizations for COVID-related illness are also on the rise, up 66 percent in the last 30 days. New ICU admissions rose 68 percent during that same time frame.
“Due to the increased level of community transmission, including reinfections, we strongly recommend masking, especially in crowded spaces or around family, friends and colleagues who may be more vulnerable to COVID-19,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Our best bet in preventing hospitalizations and deaths is to stay up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters, and isolating from others when sick.”
Vaccinations are available to everyone 6 months of age and older. Boosters are available for everyone age five and older. Those 50 and older, and those who are moderately or severely immunocompromised, are encouraged to get a second booster four months after their initial booster.
COVID-19 Treatment
A variety of treatment options are available to San Diegans who test positive for COVID-19. Treatment is recommended for high-risk individuals because it can prevent illness from progressing to the point where an individual needs hospital services. Timely treatment also lowers the risk of dying from COVID.
Oral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral pills should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.
To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Close to 2.99 million or 94.9% of San Diegans age 5 and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Over 2.64 million or 84.0%.
Boosters administered: 1,385,514 or 57.5% of 2,408,140 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

16 additional deaths were reported since the last report on June 30. The region’s total is 5,357.
Of the 16 additional deaths, eight were women and eight were men. They died between Jan. 10 and June 30, 2022; six of the deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Six of the people who died were 80 years or older, six were in their 70s, one was in their 60s, and three were in their 50s.
11 were fully vaccinated and five were not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates, Hospitalizations and Testing:

3,050 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past two days (July 5 to July 6, 2022). The region’s total is now 844,017.
9,763 cases were reported in the past week (June 30 through July 6) compared to 11,019 infections identified the previous week (June 23 through June 29).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 44.75 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 25.87 for fully vaccinated people and 84.07 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
8,995 tests were reported to the County on July 2, and the percentage of new positive cases was 14.9% (Data through July 2).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through July 2, is 13.1%.

1049,County and Local Partners Launch Parks After Dark Program,"The County of San Diego is teaming up with the City of San Diego, San Diego Parks Foundation and other local partners to launch a new program that will transform three area parks into safe, family friendly, nighttime entertainment spaces throughout the summer.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-and-local-partners-launch-parks-after-dark-program/,2022-07-12T16:30:20-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is teaming up with the City of San Diego, San Diego Parks Foundation and other local partners to launch a new program that will transform three area parks into safe, family friendly, nighttime entertainment spaces throughout the summer.
The Parks After Dark events will feature live entertainment, activities for all ages, games and free meals for kids. The program will be offered from 6 to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights at the City Heights, Linda Vista, and Skyline Hills Recreation Centers.
“The County of San Diego is pleased to help support Parks After Dark that provides a wide range of enjoyable, supervised activities and safe services to our neighborhood children and adults,” said Chair Nathan Fletcher, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “The County is supporting programs that improve youth mental health – and being able to enjoy our parks is one way to do that.”
Parks After Dark is modeled after similar programs in the area, including a number of County initiatives. These programs are credited with reducing crime and creating a sense of community and safe places to gather and play on summer nights.
Since 2007, the County has conducted nighttime park activities such as sunset hikes, full-moon hikes, star parties, campfire programs, summer movies and concerts. It also has an ongoing partnership with the Parks Foundation under the ‘Get Kids Outside’ initiative which has offered a series of free or low-cost events in over 20 recreation and aquatic centers across South and Central San Diego.
“Parks After Dark programming provides an opportunity for children, teens, grandparents and entire families to get together outdoors and enjoy fun, safe, community-based activities right in their own neighborhoods,” said Nick Macchione, director of the County Health and Human Services Agency. “The County is proud to support this initiative because we know that communities are stronger and healthier when people can safely get together outdoors, be active, connect with friends and neighbors and enjoy quality family time.”
San Diego’s Parks After Dark program kicks off this week and runs through Aug. 27. For more information, visit https://comeplaysd.com/programs/

1050,Men Who Have Sex with Men Encouraged to Protect Themselves from Monkeypox,"County health officials are encouraging gay, bisexual and transgender men who have sex with men to abstain or practice safer sex to avoid getting and spreading the monkeypox virus.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/men-who-have-sex-with-men-encouraged-to-protect-themselves-from-monkeypox/,2022-07-12T17:20:43-07:00,"
County health officials are encouraging gay, bisexual, transgender and other men who have sex with men to abstain or practice safer sex to avoid getting and spreading the monkeypox virus.
There have been three confirmed and three probable monkeypox cases in San Diego County. Nationally, monkeypox cases have been primarily in men who have sex with men who attended circuit or rave parties.
“We want our community to be mindful of how monkeypox spreads,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “While it’s not inherently a sexually transmitted disease, close or body contact with somebody with monkeypox can pass the virus on to you. Ask potential partners about any rashes, and if you’re sick yourself, please stay home and consider seeking medical attention.”
With the national supply of vaccine being extremely limited, the County is focusing on vaccinating people at higher risk of contracting and having severe illness from the virus. This includes confirmed contacts of those infected and at-risk patients of County STD clinics.
The County continues working with representatives of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities on messaging and in planning for monkeypox vaccination clinics. Two vaccination clinics will take place this week ahead of San Diego Pride. In addition, the County worked with the community on two recently completed vaccination clinics for invasive meningococcal disease.
About 600 JYNNEOS® monkeypox vaccine doses will be administered this week, by appointment only, to San Diego County residents in the following groups:

People at higher risk of exposure to monkeypox, especially gay, bisexual, transgender and other men who have sex with men and who have two or more sexual partners
People who participate in circuit/rave parties

“We appreciate people’s willingness to get vaccinated and we hope to expand soon, but given the low supply of vaccine right now, we need to prioritize distribution of the doses we have,” Kaiser said. “If you suspect you may have been exposed to monkeypox, stay home, avoid contact with others and call your medical provider. We can work with them to help protect you too.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that it’s not clear how the people were exposed to monkeypox, but early data suggest that gay, bisexual men and other men who have sex with men make up a high number of cases.
However, anyone who has been in close contact with someone who has monkeypox is at risk of contracting the virus.
“It’s important to remember that the risk of human monkeypox for the general public remains very low,” Kaiser said.
About Monkeypox
Monkeypox is a viral infection that can spread through contact with body fluids, sores on the body of someone who has monkeypox, or from shared items (e.g., clothing and bedding) that have been contaminated with fluids from sores of a person with monkeypox.
The disease can also spread between people through saliva or respiratory droplets, typically between people in a close setting. Although monkeypox is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, it can be transmitted during sex through skin-to-skin and other intimate contact, regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
Cases of monkeypox have previously been identified in travelers from, or residents of, countries in western and central Africa where monkeypox is endemic. Since May 2022, monkeypox cases have been reported in several non-endemic countries, including the United States.
Monkeypox Symptoms
Symptoms of monkeypox are similar to, but milder than, the signs and symptoms of smallpox, a related but extinct virus. They include:

Fever
Headache
Muscle aches
Backache
Swollen lymph nodes
Chills
Exhaustion

A rash usually develops within 1 to 3 days after the appearance of fever.  This rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appears on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus.
Most people who develop monkeypox experience symptoms within seven to 14 days (and up to 21 days) after exposure.
Most people who become infected with monkeypox have a mild illness that improves without treatment over two to four weeks. Monkeypox is contagious and can spread to others until scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed.
What People Should Do
Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms of monkeypox, including unusual rashes or lesions, should contact a healthcare provider right away. Cover the area of the rash with clothing, wear a mask and avoid skin-to-skin or close contact with others until the symptoms are medically evaluated.

1051,New East Otay Mesa County Fire Station Will Serve Rapidly Developing Border Area,"The San Diego County Fire Protection District broke ground Tuesday on Fire Station 38 in East Otay Mesa. Once built, the station will serve a rapidly developing area which includes warehouses, transport businesses, two power plants and a battery facility. Crews housed there will also respond to calls on expanding roads and highways in the area carrying traffic crossing the U.S. and Mexico border.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208946,2022-07-12T17:45:16-07:00,"
The San Diego County Fire Protection District broke ground Tuesday on Fire Station 38 in East Otay Mesa. Once built, the station will serve a rapidly developing area which includes warehouses, transport businesses, two power plants and a battery facility. Crews housed there will also respond to calls on expanding roads and highways in the area carrying traffic crossing the U.S. and Mexico border.
The $14.6 million station will be staffed with 12 personnel and have a ladder truck, a fire engine, ambulances and other apparatus and will be located just to the south of the intersection of Alta and Otay Mesa roads.
County officials held a ceremony Tuesday to kick off the construction project and to talk about its significance.
“This is a project that is long overdue for our communities. Each year, there are approximately 1,500 calls for this service area and we know the number will be increasing as well. With the future addition of the East Otay Mesa Port of Entry, the arrival of new businesses, and upcoming housing developments, East Otay Mesa has a very vibrant future,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas, San Diego County Board of Supervisors, District 1. “This new station will ensure that we continue to meet the needs of a growing region.”
The station will be 14.000 square feet with four double-depth apparatus bays, 12 bedrooms, a kitchen, an office, a day room, a fitness room and a conference room.
Station 38 is designed to be the first Zero Net Energy fire station for the County with roof solar panels and is also designed to achieve LEED Gold certification.
“We look forward to being back in a year to have the grand opening,” said Chief Tony Mecham, CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire Protection District.
This year the County will be investing nearly $50 million annually into a cooperative agreement with CAL FIRE to staff 20 fire stations around-the-clock by employing over 200 personnel. When County-funded positions are combined with the State, San Diego County Fire is the second largest fire department in our region.

1052,988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline Adds to County’s Resources,"People experiencing a suicide, mental health or substance use crisis will now be able to call or text to a three-digit 988 dialing code to get help for themselves or a loved one.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208960,2022-07-14T09:57:50-07:00,"
People experiencing a suicide, mental health or substance use crisis will now be able to call or text to a three-digit 988 dialing code to get help for themselves or a loved one.
Starting July 16, San Diegans will be able to call 988 and be connected to a trained counselor who can help them and connect them to services in the area where they live. This new service is in addition to the County’s Access and Crisis Line (ACL) at (888) 724-7240.
With its launch, 988 will serve as the new nationwide phone number for connecting people to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a national network of local crisis centers that provides free and confidential emotional support to people in a suicidal, mental health and/or substance use crisis, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week in the United States. People can still call or text the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
During the initial rollout, calls and texts made to 988 will be connected to a local crisis call center based on the phone number the call is made from and the capabilities of the call center. For example:

Calls made from San Diego County area codes, which include 619, 858, 760, and 442, will be routed directly to the Access and Crisis Line.
Calls made from other area codes will be routed to the local crisis call center based on the caller’s area code. Texts to 988 will be transferred to a call center equipped for text and chat. In these cases, call center staff will work to deescalate the situation and reroute the client to the crisis call center closest to their current location for local services if needed.

The 988-dialing code does not replace the Access and Crisis Line, which is already a partner of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.
“Anyone struggling with a substance use or mental health issue, such as depression, anxiety, suicide, loss, or anger, can call the Access and Crisis Line to speak to a representative,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “ACL clinicians are trained to respond to behavioral health-related questions and crisis situations and can provide compassionate and knowledgeable support to callers.”
Confidential and free of charge, the Access and Crisis Line offers support and resources countywide in over 200 languages from experienced counselors on all behavioral health, mental health and substance use topics, including but not limited to:

Alcohol and substance use support services
Crisis intervention
Mobile crisis response services
Mental health referrals
Suicide prevention

In 2020, suicide claimed the lives of more than 44,000 Americans, and evidence suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated suicidal thoughts and actions. Locally, 419 suicides were reported that same year.
Help is always available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at 888-724-7240 or by visiting www.Up2SD.org. Individuals in need of immediate medical attention should call 9-1-1.

The Southeastern San Diego Live Well Center’s Public Art Advisory Committee is seeking community input on artwork for the new facility.
Starting this week, people will have the chance to weigh in on which public art submissions should be chosen to grace the interior and exterior of the building.
The public can see and comment on the proposed concepts on display at the nearby Malcolm X Library and Jackie Robinson YMCA during regular business hours. The concepts will also be on display at several community events and meetings taking place over the next few weeks:

July 18 – Chollas Valley Planning Group (virtual community meeting) at 6:30 p.m.
July 25 – Central Region Leadership Meeting (virtual community meeting) from 1:30 -3:30 p.m.
July 26 – In-person feedback opportunity at Malcolm X Library from 5 to 7 p.m.
July 28 – Virtual session with invited artist, link to be posted here
July 30 – Project New Village Health & Healing Summerfest from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
July 30 – Leon Williams Recognition Event from 2 to 6 p.m. at the County Administration Center, 1600 Pacific Highway, San Diego
July 13 – 31- Review the concepts and take the survey online

The public art tour marks the next stage in opening the one-stop social services and community center at Market Street and Euclid Avenue. Construction for the 65,000-square-foot center started last October.
From its conception, the local community played an integral role in the Southeastern Live Well Center’s creation, design and workforce. The center will offer self-sufficiency and family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans’ services. The building site will also include a shared space for community meetings, a meditation garden open to all and more.
The County has a policy of including public art at new County buildings. For the new Live Well Center, more than 100 artists submitted applications to the Public Art Advisory Committee last April in hopes of winning a commission. Fourteen finalists were selected to present their concepts.
“We looked for experienced artists with roots in the community and commissioned them to create unique designs that will support the art statement to create a welcoming environment and celebrate the history, diversity and cross-cultural experiences of the community while educating, creating beauty, inspiration and healing.” said art consultant to the Public Art Advisory Committee Leah Goodwin of Leah Goodwin Creations.
Once selected, the art will include a welcoming sculpture in the outdoor main entry plaza, a sculpture in the meditation garden, artwork showcasing the grand staircase and second-floor skylight, along with other pieces for the waiting and conference rooms, family play area and building corridors.
The project’s Public Art Advisory Committee will consider the community feedback before making its final decisions. The committee includes the architect, the project manager and nine community residents and stakeholders, including two youth representatives, the Manzanita Band of the Kumeyaay Nation, Asian Pacific Islander Initiative, Multicultural Health Foundation, Pacific Islander Collaborative of San Diego, Project New Village and the Jackie Robinson Family YMCA.
“I am very impressed by the volume of response and the level of talent that we have seen in the artist submissions,” said Project New Village Executive Director, Diane Moss, Public Art Advisory Committee member and founder of the Mt. Hope Community Garden. “I know quite a few of the artists, but it was wonderful to hear more about what they do, their story and their connections to the neighborhood.”
The art designs will be selected in August and installed before the Southeastern San Diego Live Well Center celebrates its grand opening next summer.

After a national recruitment, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency has selected Lucero Chavez Basilio, an experienced representative for immigrants and refugees, as the first director for the County Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs.
“After years of advocacy from the community, I was proud to bring forward a proposal with Vice Chair Vargas last year to create the Office of Immigrant & Refugee Affairs,” said Nathan Fletcher, Chair, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “I am truly excited to welcome Ms. Chavez Basilio to head the Office, I am confident that with her experience, passion and leadership, we will continue to make San Diego County more welcoming for all residents.”
“Lucero Chavez Basilio brings a wealth of experience working with immigrant and refugee families and has the vision to lead the new Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs,” said Nora Vargas, Vice Chair, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “I am thrilled she will lead the agency working in partnership with the community and elevating the positive contributions immigrants and refugees bring to our culture and economy in the bi-national region.”
A bilingual Spanish speaker and attorney, Chavez Basilio has spent more than 10 years representing immigrant and refugee children and families in immigration proceedings and in humanitarian and family-based petitions. She has worked with city councils, community organizations and law enforcement agencies throughout Southern California to create and implement pro immigrant policies and programs.
“This is an important day for the County of San Diego, one that acknowledges the rich and ongoing contributions, as well as the needs, of our region’s immigrants and refugees,” said Nick Macchione, director of the Health and Human Services Agency. “The Board of Supervisors was visionary in its creation of the Office of Immigrant & Refugee Affairs, and now we have a director with the life experience and skills to lead it forward.”

1055,High Risk for COVID-19 in San Diego County,The continued increase in local coronavirus cases has prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to move San Diego County to its high-risk level for COVID-19.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=208987,2022-07-14T15:59:10-07:00,"
The continued increase in local coronavirus cases has prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to move San Diego County to its high-risk level for COVID-19.
The CDC tracks community levels of the virus based on geographic regions to determine the impact of COVID-19 in communities, and to allow individual jurisdictions to implement preventive strategies based on the latest local data.
San Diego had been in the medium-risk category since the end of May, but recent spikes in hospitalizations and new cases have led the CDC to increase the risk level for the region.
Actions You Can Take
The high-risk level means COVID-19 is widespread throughout the region and San Diegans should continue taking precautions to slow the spread of the virus. You should:

Wear a mask indoors when in public
Get all the vaccine doses and boosters
Stay home if you are sick and get tested
Avoid crowded places
Take other precautions, such as washing your hands and staying away from people who are visibly sick

The County continues to follow the California Department of Public Health’s SMARTER plan, which recommends vaccination, use of masks, testing and treatment among other things.
“San Diegans should take every precaution necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Most San Diegans have been vaccinated, but with this virus, and with the prevalence and infectivity of the new variants, a booster is highly recommended, especially for people who are immunocompromised or have other comorbidities.”
Got COVID? Get Treatment 
If you do get COVID-19, County health officials say treatment is available. Treatment can help prevent high-risk individuals from getting sick enough to need hospital services and even from dying from COVID.
Oral medications, in the form of pills, and monoclonal antibodies, in the form of an intravenous infusion, are available at multiple locations and community pharmacies across San Diego. Antiviral medications require a doctor’s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.
To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Over 3.0 million or 89.7% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: Nearly 2.65 million or 79.2%.
Boosters administered: 1,396,563 or 57.8% of 2,418,004 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

13 additional deaths were reported since the last report on July 7. The region’s total is 5,370.
Of the 13 additional deaths, four were women and nine were men. They died between May 23 and July 7, 2022; five deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Eight of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and one was in their 40s.
11 were fully vaccinated and two were not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

5,576 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (July 11 to July 13, 2022). The region’s total is now 857,182.
12,948 cases were reported in the past week (July 7 through July 13) compared to 9,763 infections identified the previous week (June 30 through July 6).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 43.95 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 27.01 for fully vaccinated people and 87.71 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
12,747 tests were reported to the County on July 9, and the percentage of new positive cases was 14.9% (Data through July 9).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through July 9, is 14.5%.

The County wants to hear from you to discuss plans for federal funds that support community projects and programs for people in need of services. Housing and Community Development Services is inviting community members and local non-profit representatives to provide input on the department’s Federal Entitlement Annual Plan which covers available federal Housing and Urban Development grants.
The federal grant programs include the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships, Emergency Solutions Grants and Housing Opportunities for Persons with HIV/AIDS. These federal programs provide funding to cover things like neighborhood revitalization and community development projects and housing assistance for people experiencing homelessness and those living with HIV/AIDS. The County of San Diego receives approximately $12 million annually in federal entitlement funding for housing & community development.
Housing and Community Development Services is hosting public in-person and virtual meetings between July 20 and 26. The meetings are an opportunity to identify community needs and connect with potential applicants. They will cover information on how to apply for CDBG including eligibility requirements as well as the purpose of the annual plan and its four federal grant programs and past projects funded by the federal. Each meeting will include time for a question-and-answer session.

1059,Got COVID? Get Treatment Now!,"Chances are that you or someone you know has tested positive for COVID-19 amid the current wave of new infections in the region. Treatment is available and can help prevent severe infection, but it is important to seek help as soon as possible to see if it’s right for you.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209016,2022-07-21T16:47:52-07:00,"
Chances are that you or someone you know has tested positive for COVID-19 amid the current wave of new infections in the region.
Treatment is available and can help prevent severe infection, but it is important to seek help as soon as possible to see if it’s right for you.
“If you’re already vaccinated then treatment gives you extra protection, and it can reduce your risk of hospitalization or worse even if you’re not,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Treatment works best if it’s started as soon as possible after infection, so get tested as soon as symptoms develop.”
Antiviral medications require a doctor’s prescription and should be started within five days of developing symptoms of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies should be given no more than seven days after the onset of symptoms.
Treatment centers and medical offices in the region may offer oral antiviral pills, such as Paxlovid and/or monoclonal antibodies delivered as an intravenous infusion. A provider will determine what treatment option is best for each individual patient based on their symptoms, age and potential underlying conditions.
Treatment is available to individuals who meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines for the medications, including those who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19:

Adults age 50 or older
People of color
Lower economic status
People with underlying condition(s)
Unvaccinated San Diegans

To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.
Prevent Illness
San Diego is currently in the CDC’s high-risk community level for COVID-19, meaning virus transmission is widespread throughout the region. San Diegans should take precautions to slow the spread of the virus and:

Wear a mask indoors when in public
Get all the vaccine doses and boosters
Stay home if you are sick and get tested
Avoid crowded places
Take other precautions, such as washing your hands and staying away from people who are visibly sick

“Treatment helps,” said Kaiser, “but the best approach is always prevention.”
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Over 3.0 million or 89.8% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.65 million or 79.3%.
Boosters administered: 1,406,860 or 58.0% of 2,425,587 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

17 additional deaths were reported since the last report on July 14. The region’s total is 5,387.
Of the 17 additional deaths, five were women and 12 were men. They died between June 6 and July 13, 2022; six deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Nine of the people who died were 80 years or older, five were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and one was in their 50s.
14 were fully vaccinated and three were not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

5,488 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (July 18 to July 20, 2022). The region’s total is now 870,079.
12,528 cases were reported in the past week (July 14 through July 20) compared to 12,948 infections identified the previous week (July 7 through July 13).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 51.52 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 30.02 for fully vaccinated people and 89.64 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
9,564 tests were reported to the County on July 16, and the percentage of new positive cases was 14.9% (Data through July 16).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through July 16, is 15.8%.

1061,County and Partners Break Ground on Housing Complex for Homeless Seniors,The County and its partners broke ground Monday on a new housing complex for seniors who experience homelessness.

The County and its partners broke ground Monday on a new housing complex for seniors who experience homelessness. The 74-unit project in the Nestor area will serve San Diegans age 55 and older who are currently unsheltered or at risk of becoming homeless.
While all units at Nestor Senior Village will serve homeless seniors, about half of the units will be set aside specifically to serve homeless seniors with a serious mental illness.
“Nestor Senior Village will bring much needed supportive housing to this community,” said David Estrella, director of HHSA’s Housing and Community Development Services. “Affordable housing coupled with comprehensive supportive services will ensure that seniors experiencing mental health challenges truly benefit from this development.”

Nestor Senior Village is a collaboration between the County, City of San Diego, San Diego Housing Commission and Nestor United Methodist Church. The church is leasing some of its surplus land to the development through a ground lease and the housing complex is being constructed adjacent to the church.
The County provided $7.5 million in funding through its No Place Like Home initiative and the San Diego Housing Commission provided about $3 million in capital funding in addition to 73 project-based housing vouchers.
Serving A Growing Population
Many older adults find themselves struggling to stay sheltered due to the high cost of living in the area, major illness or even the loss of a spouse. One in every four people who experiences homelessness in San Diego is 55 years or older and that number is expected to rise as the Baby Boomer generation ages.
Nestor Senior Village is one of more than a dozen projects the County of San Diego is supporting that are currently under construction across the region. Combined, the developments will add more than 950 affordable housing units to our local communities.
The new senior housing complex aligns with the County’s Framework for Ending Homelessness, which was approved by the Board last year.
As part of the framework, the County has committed to investing more than $53 million to create supportive housing for persons with a serious mental illness who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.
Nestor Senior Village is expected to open in January 2024.

1062,"County Working with LGBTQ Leaders to Prevent Spread of Monkeypox, Vaccinate People at Higher Risk","As the number of human monkeypox cases increases in the region, the County continues to work with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community to develop messaging, education materials and to administer the limited number of vaccines coming to the area.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209037,2022-07-25T17:49:05-07:00,"
As the number of human monkeypox cases increases in the region, the County continues to work with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community to develop messaging, education materials and to administer the limited number of vaccines coming to the area.
The County is sponsoring two vaccination events July 28 and 29, where about 800 doses will be administered to those most at risk. Appointments are required to get a vaccine and are available by calling 2-1-1.
As it did earlier this month, the County is working with LGBTQ representatives and organizations to get the word out about the upcoming vaccination clinics. Appointments are expected to fill quickly.
Given the scarcity of the monkeypox vaccine and as guided by the California Department of Public Health, the County is focusing on delivering first doses to as many people at high risk as possible.  For the current outbreak, that includes men who have sex with men and multiple partners, as well as close contacts of reported cases. The County’s approach is in line with strategies in other large jurisdictions with monkeypox outbreaks, including New York and San Francisco.
Along with the two vaccine events, the County has sent about 900 doses to local vaccine providers such as UC San Diego, Family Health Centers of San Diego, Vista Community Clinic and San Ysidro Health. The County’s STD clinics also have some doses available for patients being seen at those clinics.
The state allocates vaccines to counties based on the number of monkeypox and syphilis cases in men reported in a region. To date, San Diego County has received about 2,200 doses and has 20 confirmed and probable cases.
“The virus is primarily spreading in gay and bisexual men who have more than one sexual partner or attend sex parties, but anyone who is exposed can get it,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Having intimate contact or anonymous sex with people you meet in dating or hook-up apps increases your risk of contracting the virus. Please ask your partners about recent illnesses or rashes.”
The County is getting 80 courses of tecovirimat or TPOXX, an antiviral medication to treat people who have been infected with monkeypox. The treatment will be delivered primarily through the region’s established healthcare partners, with priority to patients who may be at risk of complications.
County health officials will continue to meet with LGBTQ representatives to determine how and where vaccines should be distributed when more doses become available as well as appropriate messaging on steps people can take to prevent infection. Based on information from the CDC, the acute shortage of vaccinations is expected to continue into 2023.
About Monkeypox
Monkeypox is a viral infection that can spread through contact with body fluids, sores on the body of someone who has monkeypox, or from shared items (e.g., clothing and bedding) that have been contaminated with fluids from sores of a person with monkeypox.
The disease can also spread between people through saliva or respiratory droplets, typically between people in a close setting. Although monkeypox is not generally considered a sexually transmitted disease, it can be transmitted during sex through skin-to-skin and other intimate contact, regardless of gender or sexual orientation, including close contact that may not be necessarily sexual.
Monkeypox Symptoms
Symptoms of monkeypox are similar to, but milder than, the signs and symptoms of smallpox, a related but extinct virus. They include:

Fever
Headache
Muscle aches
Backache
Swollen lymph nodes
Chills
Exhaustion

A rash usually develops within 1 to 3 days after the appearance of fever.  This rash can look like pimples or blisters that appear on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus.
Most people who develop monkeypox experience symptoms within seven to 14 days (and up to 21 days) after exposure.
Most people who become infected with monkeypox have a mild illness that improves without treatment over two to four weeks. Monkeypox is contagious and can spread to others once someone has symptoms from it and until scabs have fallen off and a new layer of skin has formed.
What People Should Do
Anyone who thinks they may have symptoms of monkeypox, including unusual rashes or lesions, should contact a healthcare provider right away or call 2-1-1 for more information.
You must have a rash, or spots, to get a monkeypox test. The monkeypox test is done on your skin with a swab at a clinic or health care provider. The swab is rubbed against spots on your skin, or parts of your rash, and then sent to a specialized lab for monkeypox testing. A preliminary lab test result is usually available within a few days.
Those waiting for results are asked to take steps to care for themselves and others. These include:

Stay home and away from others.
Put off travel on public transportation.
Contact your sex partner(s) and people you have had close contact with since the start of your symptoms.
Protect any pets.

The start of August means summer break is coming to an end, and it is time to get the kids ready to go back to school.
As families make their back-to-school to-do lists, vaccinations and well-child checkups should be top of mind, especially since the COVID-19 pandemic caused many children miss important health checkups and recommended vaccinations.
“As families with kids partake in fun back-to-school activities, like shopping for supplies and getting haircuts, they should also prioritize scheduling well-child checkups.” said Kelly Motadel, M.D., M.P.H, County Child Health Officer. “Doctor visits are essential to make sure our children are on track with growth and developmental milestones and with routine vaccinations. These shots can protect our kids from more than a dozen diseases.”
Along with kids, August is also a good time for everyone to revisit vaccine records because it is National Immunization Awareness Month (#NIAM). This annual observance highlights the importance of getting recommended vaccines throughout your life.
Vaccines for school-aged children include DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis/whooping cough), Hep B, MMR (measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine), chickenpox, polio and more.
Additionally, the HPV vaccine is recommended for children ages 9 to 12, and everyone through age 26 to help prevent certain cancers and infections.
More information about vaccines and where to get them is available on the County website or by calling 211.

1064,County Getting Ready to Install Naloxone Vending Machines,The County of San Diego is readying a new tool to help fight the growing number of opioid overdoses in the region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209067,2022-07-28T14:27:07-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is readying a new tool to help fight the growing number of opioid overdoses in the region.
The County will install 12 naloxone vending machines throughout the region by next summer, with half of them scheduled to go up by the end of this year.
Naloxone, also known by the brand name Narcan, is a medication used to reverse overdoses by restoring normal breathing. The drug can prevent overdose deaths if used quickly and followed by medical treatment.
“Naloxone is a proven life saver in overdose situations and San Diego County Behavioral Health Services and its partners are working hard to expand access,” said Nicole Esposito, the County’s chief population health officer. “The enhanced distribution of naloxone into the hands of community members is vital in saving lives that might otherwise be lost to overdose.”
Risks related to substance use and opioid-related drug overdoses have been on the rise in the region for the last couple of years.
Based on preliminary data, nearly 900 people died from accidental opioid overdoses in San Diego County in 2021. That’s a 55 percent increase compared to 2020.
A Comprehensive Effort
The goal of the County’s Naloxone Distribution Program is to disseminate 33,000 naloxone kits by June 30 of next year.
Use of the vending machines will be open to anyone in the community 18 years of age or older.
Registration and use will be anonymous and free of charge. Anyone who wishes to access the vending machines must first complete an online training. Once completed, individuals will receive a pin to access naloxone from the vending machines.
The Naloxone Distribution Program directly aligns with the San Diego County’s Comprehensive Harm Reduction Strategy, which was approved by the County Board of Supervisors last year. The program provides wrap-around services for San Diegans who use drugs.
In addition to the naloxone vending machines, the effort includes targeted outreach and trainings and partnerships with community-based programs.
Treatment is Available
The County funds residential and outpatient treatment programs across the region to help people recover from substance use disorders.
Participation in treatment and recovery services improves wellbeing, can reunite families and loved ones, and also improves overall health.
Substance use treatment resources are available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240, calling 9-8-8 or by calling 2-1-1.

1065,New COVID-19 Vaccine to Be Available for San Diego Adults,"San Diego County adults looking for a more traditional vaccine against COVID-19 will soon be able to get Novavax, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209074,2022-07-28T16:39:59-07:00,"
San Diego County adults looking for a more traditional vaccine against COVID-19 will soon be able to get Novavax, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
Novavax, which is currently being used around the world, will be available in the region as soon as this weekend, County health officials said.
The vaccine was developed using protein-based technology, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been using for decades to treat diseases such as hepatitis B, shingles and human papillomavirus. The vaccine presents a specific portion of the virus which the body generates immunity against.
Novavax has been authorized as a two-dose primary series, given three to eight weeks apart, to people ages 18 and older. Clinical trials showed that the vaccine is 90% effective at preventing mild, moderate and severe COVID-19.
“This is yet another vaccine we have to slow the spread of COVID-19, especially now that we’re seeing an increase in cases and hospitalizations,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “San Diegans now have another safe choice to prevent serious complications from COVID.”
Clinical trials showed Novavax does not cause severe side effects. Reactions were mild and like those rare effects seen from COVID-19 vaccines using the mRNA technology, such as pain, tenderness, redness and swelling at the injection site.
Novavax is expected to be available at local healthcare providers, retail pharmacies, community clinics and County public health centers and community vaccination events.
Everyone 6 months and older can get COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. For those who received an mRNA vaccine, boosters are available for people 5 years and older. Parental consent is required for all eligible minors to be vaccinated.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Over 3.0 million or 89.9% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.65 million or 79.3%.
Boosters administered: 1,416,251 or 58.3% of 2,430,747 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

22 additional deaths were reported since the last report on July 21. The region’s total is 5,409.
Of the 22 additional deaths, 14 were women and eight were men. They died between Jan. 24 and July 20, 2022; 15 deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
12 of the people who died were 80 years or older, four were in their 70s, one was in their 60s, three were in their 50s, one was in their 40s and one was in their 30s.
14 were fully vaccinated and eight were not.
20 had underlying medical conditions, one did not and one had medical history pending.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

5,092 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (July 25 to July 27, 2022). The region’s total is now 881,729.
11,362 cases were reported in the past week (July 21 through July 27) compared to 12,528 infections identified the previous week (July 14 through July 20).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 54.35 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 32.53 for fully vaccinated people and 93.86 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
7,040 tests were reported to the County on July 23, and the percentage of new positive cases was 14.1% (Data through July 23).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through July 23, is 15.7%.

1067,County Expands Support for People Leaving Jail and Returning to Their Communities,The County of San Diego was awarded $6 million in Proposition 47 grant funding that will be used to help people returning to their communities after serving time in County jails.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209088,2022-08-01T09:04:44-07:00,"
The County of San Diego was awarded $6 million in Proposition 47 grant funding that will be used to help people returning to their communities after serving time in County jails. The financial support is earmarked for those leaving custody who have a history of behavioral health needs and are homeless or at risk of homelessness. The County will also leverage an additional $4 million for a total program of $10 million.
“The goal of this grant and the work of the Community Care Coordination team is to help people leaving jail to gain independence, reduce criminal behavior and future returns to jail, and therefore improve public safety,” said Andrea Pella, director of Prevention, Diversion and Re-Entry for San Diego County. “This program will provide connections to care and housing resources for those who may have otherwise been homeless upon their release from jail.”
The proposed program is modeled after San Diego County’s Community Care Coordination program that connects people to the services they need in the community.  Prior to their release from jail, an adult in custody is referred to a team of clinicians and peer support specialists with lived experience.  The team meets with the client, assesses their needs and helps connect them to community support like behavioral health services, housing, and employment opportunities.  When released, the person will be transported by someone from the Community Care Coordination team directly to temporary housing.  Soon after, the team connects the individual to behavioral health services for ongoing treatment.  Additionally, the team will introduce clients to job opportunities, benefit assistance, reconnect them with family, and develop longer term housing plans.
“It is a wonderful opportunity to expand the framework of an existing successful program and advance the goals of the Board-driven Alternatives to Incarceration work that City and County health and justice partners are working tirelessly on,” Pella continues. “I appreciate the local advisory committee and county health partners’ commitment and collaboration to assist in the successful re-entry of our justice–involved population into the community.”
The program begins in September 2022 with a goal of serving 300 to 400 people before the grant period ends in June 2026.

San Diego County released its annual Love Your Heart report Tuesday, showing the February blood-pressure screening campaign alerted 473 people they were in imminent medical danger and warned nearly 22,000 others they could be vulnerable to serious illness and death from heart disease, stroke and COVID-19.
County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher, Board Vice Chair Nora Vargas, County public health officials and others gathered at the County Administration Center Tuesday for a Love Your Heart recognition event.
The annual Love Your Heart campaign, held each February, urges people to ‘know their numbers’ by getting their blood pressure screened and promotes education about the dangers of high blood-pressure. Also known as hypertension, high blood-pressure is often referred to as a “silent killer” because most people who have it do not show symptoms.
County officials said Tuesday this year’s campaign tested the blood pressure of more than 46,000 people, online, and in person at more than 287 sites in San Diego County and Mexico, between Feb. 12 and Feb. 20.
Officials said the screenings found 473 people with “crisis levels” of high blood pressure, giving them the opportunity to get immediate help. They also found another 21,813 people with higher-than-normal levels―giving them an early warning to lose weight, eat healthier, reduce stress and exercise more to avoid heart attacks or even death.
High blood pressure is a major risk factor for strokes and heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. More than 4,000 people in the county die each year of heart disease or stroke.
High blood pressure also continues to be the most common underlying condition identified in San Diego County’s COVID-19 associated deaths.
Nick Macchione, agency director of the County’s Health and Human Services Agency, said the County’s Love Your Heart campaign has reduced local deaths associated with preventable health threats including heart disease by 7% over the past 11 years.
He said the campaign has accomplished that by helping residents know their blood pressure levels and make healthy life choices, including eating healthier, exercising more and reducing stress. Macchione said the annual campaign was a public health success that is helping make San Diego County a healthy, safe and thriving place to live.
Officials said this year’s Love Your Heart campaign reached more than 7.5 million people, through the combined mediums of print, radio, billboard, transit and social media. It gave community partners more than 6,000 blood pressure monitors to give to underserved residents and supplied Love Your Heart educational packets at all COVID-19 testing sites. The campaign also reached more than 500 people through community events including the Refugee & Newcomer Fair.

1070,Ramona Fire Adds Crews and Resources in Transfer,"San Diego County Fire has accepted a transfer of responsibility for fire protection and emergency medical services in Ramona.  The deal benefits the community, the Ramona Municipal Water District and County Fire. The 40,000 people in Ramona are already seeing increased personnel in fire stations.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209124,2022-08-02T15:32:21-07:00,"
San Diego County Fire has accepted a transfer of responsibility for fire protection and emergency medical services in Ramona.  The deal benefits the community, the Ramona Municipal Water District and County Fire.
The 40,000 people in Ramona are already seeing increased personnel in fire stations.  The County has provided an additional crew member on two fire engines in the area.  The idea is to increase fire services and staffing at Ramona’s three fire stations to regionally acceptable levels.  Ramona Fire Station 80 had three crew members on its engines. Now engines at Ramona Fire Stations 81 and 82 will also have a third team member.
“This is a great example of two groups coming together to better serve the community”, says Jeff Collins, San Diego County Fire Director. “Ramona will gain more firefighters, more paramedics and updated equipment that promotes safety and well-being for our residents.  County Fire protects the community, and the Ramona Municipal Water District can focus on providing water and wastewater services.”
Since County Fire functions through a partnership with CAL FIRE, fire and emergency medical services are still provided in Ramona by professionals from CAL FIRE.
County Fire is also adding an advanced life support paramedic to the area. Ramona will also get an additional ambulance, which will be based at Ramona Fire Station 82 once the ambulance  is built and delivered. Six cardiac monitors will be added to fire engines and ambulances serving the Ramona community.
Eventually, older fire engines at Ramona Stations 81 and 82 will be replaced.
The transfer of responsibility allows the county to further consolidate and enhance regional fire protection throughout the unincorporated areas of San Diego County and leverage its size to purchase goods and services at a lower cost.
The San Diego County Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO) approved the transfer of responsibility Aug. 1.

1071,County Declares Monkeypox Local Health Emergency,Local public health and elected officials today announced the declaration of a local health emergency to respond to monkeypox in the San Diego region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209137,2022-08-02T17:11:03-07:00,"
Local public health and elected officials today announced the declaration of a local health emergency to respond to monkeypox in the San Diego region.
The action does not indicate that San Diegans are at higher risk of contracting the virus, but it is meant to reassure the public that local health authorities are proactively working to stay ahead of any challenges that may arise. The local health emergency must be ratified in 7 days, by the County Board of Supervisors, and then will need to be ratified again every 30 days, as needed.
“Our County has taken monkeypox very seriously from the beginning and those efforts will continue,” said Chairperson Nathan Fletcher, County Board of Supervisors, who was joined by other elected officials to announce the declaration. “Today, the County is declaring a local health emergency for monkeypox to align our efforts with the approach taken by the State of California. This will also allow us to strengthen our County’s vaccination, prevention, education and treatment initiatives.”
The declaration of the emergency empowers the County to:

more effectively respond to monkeypox
seek and utilize state resources for vaccine administration
leverage the public health infrastructure related to testing, contact tracing and case investigation, as well as community outreach and engagement
ensure that the County’s health professionals and other local stakeholders have all the necessary tools at their disposal

“All of these strategies were developed and strengthened during the COVID-19 response,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “To prevent the community-wide spread of monkeypox infection, the key is prevention, and this include vaccinations.”
The County has already taken multiple actions to deal with this emerging threat. It has been working with the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer community to develop messaging, education materials and to administer the limited number of vaccines coming to the area. The County has also been communicating with other local jurisdictions and community organizations.
The County has conducted a forum, mass vaccination clinics and numerous other outreach efforts. To date, 3,987 doses of monkeypox vaccine have been received in San Diego County.
As of August 1, a total of 46 confirmed and probable cases have been reported. Only one patient required hospitalization and there have been no deaths. All cases were males, and their ages range from 27 to 58 years of age. The region’s case count will now be updated daily, Monday through Friday. 
A patient gets a monkeypox vaccine at a recent vaccination event.
Two vaccination events have already taken place, where more than 1,400 monkeypox vaccines were administered over four days. The County has also made doses of vaccine available to local healthcare providers. Some monkeypox vaccine doses are also available at the County Public Health Centers and STD clinics.
The County has also distributed 110 treatment courses of Tecovirimat, a drug used to treat monkeypox, to local health care organizations and County clinics.
Given the scarcity of the monkeypox vaccine and as guided by the California Department of Public Health, the County is focusing on delivering first doses to as many people at high risk as possible. For the current outbreak, that includes men who have sex with multiple male partners and close contacts of reported cases. The County’s approach is in line with strategies in other large jurisdictions with monkeypox outbreaks, including New York City and San Francisco.
The state allocates vaccines to counties based on the number of monkeypox, as well as the number of early syphilis cases in men reported in a region.
The County also set up a text message alert system to send San Diegans real-time information about monkeypox in the region. To sign up to receive the messages, text COSD MONKEYPOX to 468-311. A social media messaging and education campaign is underway to raise awareness about monkeypox.

Child Support Services is holding a Super Saturday event from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., Aug. 13 to giveaway hundreds of backpacks filled with school supplies to all children who attend, until supplies run out. The event will be held at the Department of Child Support Services central office, at 3666 Kearny Villa Rd. 
August is Child Support Awareness month and Child Support Services wants to celebrate by helping children in the community. The goal of the giveaway is to ease the financial cost associated with returning to school, and to boost a child’s confidence and self-esteem to let them enter the school year successfully. Child Support Services recognizes local families may still be experiencing the financial impact of not only the pandemic, but also the rising costs associated with basic living expenses. 
For the special Super Saturday event, services are also available for San Diego’s parents.  Many County partners will be at the event: 

Live Well on Wheels mobile bus to help with aid eligibility
Office of Emergency Services to provide disaster preparedness information 
County Department of Human Resources to offer job opportunities 
Animal Services to help families adopt a pet (adoption fees waived in August) 
Public Defender’s Fresh Start Program to help with criminal record relief 

Child Support Services will also be available to share details on programs including High School Diploma support, Parents Invest in Education and Youth with Dreams. 
Child Support Services thanks all County agencies participating in this year’s Super Saturday, and the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department for its donations.

1073,Pet Adoption Fees Waived for Clear the Shelters through August,Your new best friend is waiting for you in one of our two County animal shelters in Bonita or Carlsbad.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/pet-adoption-fees-waived-for-clear-the-shelters-through-august/,2022-08-04T16:33:14-07:00,"
Your new best friend is waiting for you in one of our two County animal shelters in Bonita or Carlsbad.
The County Department of Animal Services currently has hundreds of dogs, cats, rabbits and other companion animals waiting to be adopted at no fee this month. County Animal Services is part of Clear the Shelters, a monthlong national effort to find caring homes for animals in shelters.
“We will be waiving adoption fees for all animals in our care for the entire month of August to celebrate Clear the Shelters and, hopefully, clear the shelters,” said Animal Services Director Kelly Campbell. “Animal shelters across the County are at, or near, capacity, including our County shelters. Moreover, shelters in general across the country are seeing more animals coming in than going out, so we really need the public’s assistance to adopt, foster or volunteer with our County shelters to support our region’s homeless pets.”
All animals will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.
You can start by going to our Adoptions page and browsing the beautiful and lovable animals from cats to dogs to roosters and guinea pigs available now. Animal Services staff recommend picking out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person. Walk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad. Fill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.
If you do adopt this month from the Bonita or Carlsbad shelter, Animal Services would like to add your adoption picture to our Clear the Shelter photo gallery on the Animal Services Facebook page and possibly share photos on the County Twitter and Animal Services and County Instagram pages. Send your picture to Communications.FGG@sdcounty.ca.gov.
If you cannot adopt, consider fostering or volunteering.
Last year, 135 animals from our County shelters found homes as part of the virtual Clear the Shelters event. Clear the Shelters is part of a campaign by NBC-owned television stations and Telemundo to find loving homes for the millions of pets who end up in the nation’s shelters each year. Cities across the country take part in the event.

1074,San Diego County Remains in High-Risk COVID Level,"COVID-19 activity remains high in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209159,2022-08-04T17:58:24-07:00,"
COVID-19 activity remains high in the region, the County Health and Human Services Agency reported today. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moved San Diego County to the high-risk level for COVID-19 three weeks ago and cases continue to trend high.
The CDC’s high-risk community level means COVID-19 is widespread throughout the region and San Diegans should continue taking precautions to slow the spread of the virus. You should:

Wear a mask indoors when in public,
Get all the vaccine doses and boosters,
Stay home if you are sick and get tested,
Avoid crowded places, and
Take other precautions, such as washing your hands and staying away from people who are visibly sick.

The County continues to follow the California Department of Public Health’s SMARTER plan, which recommends vaccination, use of masks, testing and treatment among other things.
“San Diegans should do what they can to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If you feel sick, stay home, get tested for COVID-19 and talk to your doctor about treatment options.”
Got COVID? Get Treatment
Treatment is available and can help prevent severe infection, but it is important to seek help as soon as possible to see if it’s right for you.
Treatment centers and medical offices in the region may offer oral antiviral pills, such as Paxlovid and/or monoclonal antibodies delivered as an intravenous infusion. A provider will determine what treatment option is best for each individual patient based on their symptoms, age and potential underlying conditions.
Treatment is available to individuals who meet the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s guidelines for the medications, including those who are at high risk for developing severe COVID-19:

Adults age 50 or older,
People of color,
Lower economic status,
People with underlying condition(s), and
Unvaccinated San Diegans.

To determine which treatment is best for you, talk to your doctor or health care provider, or call 2-1-1 to find a provider.

1076,County Adds Hefty Air Asset to Firefighting Capabilities,CAL FIRE San Diego acquired an exclusive-use SIKORSKY CH-54A Type 1 helicopter to add to the region’s resources in the event of a wildfire.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209166,2022-08-05T17:23:39-07:00,"
CAL FIRE San Diego acquired an exclusive-use SIKORSKY CH-54A Type 1 helicopter to add to the region’s resources in the event of a wildfire.
“The new Type 1 helicopter significantly bolsters our local air attack arsenal.  It can drop about seven times as much water as the existing County firefighting helicopters,” said Jeff Collins, San Diego County Fire director.
A Type 1 is the most powerful helicopter in County Fire’s air assets. CAL FIRE/San Diego County Fire has a cooperative agreement to use the Sheriff’s Bell 205 Type 2 initial attack helicopters and they have a 375-gallon capacity. The SIKORSKY CH-54A has a capacity to carry 2,650 gallons of water.
“This is a tremendous amount of water available in one drop,” said fire Capt. Frank LoCoco, CAL FIRE San Diego. “It allows us to fight these fires aggressively and keep them small.”
The SIKORSKY CH-54A arrived in the County on Aug. 1 and is an exclusive use contract with CAL FIRE to respond as needed. It will operate out of the Ramona Airport.
In total, the region will have up to nine staffed firefighting helicopters and three planes, which are provided by the County, CAL FIRE, U.S. Forest Service, the City of San Diego and San Diego Gas & Electric. The partnership between County Fire, the Sheriff’s Department and CAL FIRE, along with the coordination with regional partners, adds substantial fire suppression from the air to assist ground resources.

1077,Monkeypox Vaccine: Where to Get It,"The supply of monkeypox vaccines continues to be low compared to demand nationwide. However, the region does continue to receive its allocation of monkeypox vaccine from the California Department of Public Health.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209170,2022-08-08T19:12:40-07:00,"
The global monkeypox outbreak is occurring in the gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with multiple male partners. Currently, the risk of contracting monkeypox for the public remains very low.
Vaccination is an important prevention strategy to contain the outbreak. Nonetheless, the supply of monkeypox vaccines continues to be low compared to demand nationwide. However, the region does continue to receive its allocation of monkeypox vaccine from the California Department of Public Health.
Who Is Eligible?
Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention primarily recommends the monkeypox vaccine for people exposed to someone who has been diagnosed with confirmed or probable monkeypox infection and persons with immunocompromising conditions who are at greater risk of developing severe disease or complications if they contract the virus.
Where Is the Vaccine Available?
The 1,550 vaccine doses distributed this week reflect the vaccines allocated, not what remains in stock. Vaccines can be found at the following healthcare systems, federally qualified health centers and clinics by appointment only:

UC San Diego – Owen Clinic (200 doses)
AIDS Healthcare Foundation Healthcare Center San Diego (200 doses)
Vista Community Clinic (200 doses)
San Ysidro Health Center (150 doses)
Family Health Centers of San Diego (100 doses).

County Public Health Centers and STD clinics also have about 300 doses of vaccine available by appointment only, as well.
Of the 1,550 doses being distributed this week, almost all are to the healthcare providers and clinics above, as well as a county reserve for close contacts of confirmed or probable cases.
Where Is Testing Available?
Testing is widely available through healthcare providers and involves using a swab to sample suspect skin lesions. People with no healthcare provider, who need testing, can call 2-1-1 to be referred to a provider. 2-1-1 is not presently providing vaccination appointments.
What About Second Doses?
The monkeypox vaccine is a two-dose series, administered 28 days apart. Following guidance from the California Department of Public Health, given the low supply of vaccine, the County is presently recommending that first doses be administered to as many eligible people as possible. One dose of the monkeypox vaccine is 80% effective. Second doses will be administered when more vaccine is available.
“Our goal is to get one dose into as many people’s eligible arms as possible,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “When we get more vaccine, we can start giving second doses for even higher efficacy.”
Since late May, the County has received 4,687 doses of monkeypox vaccine. Of those, 3,251 have been distributed and 2,267 have been administered. The number administered might be higher because it takes a few days for the vaccine registry to be updated. As more doses are allotted to the region, the County will expand distribution.

For the general public, the current risk of contracting monkeypox remains very low.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209184,2022-08-08T19:30:22-07:00,"
(Editor’s Note: A prior version of this article was updated on August 9, to clarify monkeypox vaccine eligibility and which medical providers received allotments.)
The global monkeypox outbreak is occurring primarily in gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men. For the general public, the current risk of contracting monkeypox remains very low.
While vaccination is an important component in containing the outbreak, the demand currently outweighs supply. The region receives monkeypox vaccine from the California Department of Public Health based on a statewide allocation formula.
Who Is Eligible?
Given the limited vaccine supply at this time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the monkeypox vaccine for the population most at risk. These are people exposed to someone who has already been diagnosed with confirmed or probable monkeypox infection and those with immunocompromising conditions who are at greater risk of developing severe disease or complications if they contract the virus.
Where Did Recent Vaccine Allocation Go?
This week 1,550 vaccine doses were allocated to the region and have been sent to designated healthcare systems, federally qualified health centers and clinics in the region. For those eligible and who also have a referral from a healthcare provider, vaccines are available by appointment only:

UC San Diego – Owen Clinic (200 doses)
AIDS Healthcare Foundation Healthcare Center San Diego (200 doses)
Vista Community Clinic (200 doses)
San Ysidro Health Center (150 doses)
Family Health Centers of San Diego (100 doses).

County Public Health Centers also have about 300 doses of vaccine available by appointment only and based on the eligibility criteria detailed above.
Where Is Testing Available?
Testing is widely available through healthcare providers and involves using a swab to sample suspect skin lesions. People with no healthcare provider, who need testing, can call 2-1-1 to be referred to a provider. 2-1-1 is not presently providing vaccination appointments.

County Board of Supervisors Chair Nathan Fletcher, parks officials and others officially kicked off “Experience the Outdoors,” Wednesday, a campaign to give more San Diegans opportunities to enjoy nature and the County’s regional parks.
The campaign is designed specially to attract people, children, teens and families, who haven’t been to parks, whether it’s because they don’t have outdoor equipment or aren’t aware of the free programs the County offers. The campaign will include a RAD regional parks events series that features a different County regional park and at least three events each month; a Ride On Mountain Biking Challenge and a Parks 101: first timer series. The latter series will teach participants outdoor essentials, under the direction of County staff, including things like how to hike and mountain-bike safely, how to camp, fish, kayak and even rock climb. It’s designed specifically for those people, who for various reasons, are newcomers to outdoor experiences. Fees are waived and all equipment is provided.

1081,County opens first Safe Parking Site for Homeless in East County,A new overnight option has opened for people experiencing homelessness in East County. The safe parking lot is designed to help persons experiencing homelessness who have cars but no place to safely park them at night.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209204,2022-08-10T18:08:44-07:00,"
A new overnight option has opened for people experiencing homelessness in East County.
The safe parking lot is designed to help persons experiencing homelessness who have cars but no place to safely park them at night.
Second District County Supervisor Joel Anderson, who represents the East County, was joined at the opening by the County’s Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities and others. Those included a team of local organizations, community partners and other county departments who worked on the project and that provide outreach in the surrounding area.
This is the first Safe Parking program opened by the County. It includes hygiene facilities, 24/7 security, two hot meals for overnight guests and access to local YMCA facilities.
“I am thankful to my Board colleagues for supporting my ‘Compassionate Emergency Solutions’ board letter that made this Safe Parking a reality in East County,” Anderson said. “This safe parking lot is an incredibly important step in the right direction toward us solving this homelessness crisis – and creating a safer community.”
The 17-space site is located on North Magnolia Avenue in El Cajon in an unincorporated area of San Diego County. Parking spaces are assigned by referral only through the County’s Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities outreach teams. The lot opens nightly at 5:30 p.m. Guests must exit each morning by 7:00 am.
Dreams for Change, a local homeless service provider, has been contracted by the county to run the program. Its case managers will assist customers with housing navigation and connect them to resources to help them transition to a more permanent housing solution.
“This is just one example of the County’s commitment to homelessness, behavioral health and substance use,” said Nick Macchione, Director of the County’s Health and Human Services Agency. “More plans are underway in East County for Mobile Crisis Response Teams and a new East County Crisis Stabilization Unit.”
Earlier this year, the Magnolia Avenue site was part of a large homeless encampment that spread below the overpass and spilled into the street.
County homeless outreach teams walked the area for two months, offering support and direct services to everyone living here. Those teams issued EBT cards, distributed 219 hygiene and 178 Narcan kits, provided 48 vaccines and connected 103 individuals to shelter and housing.
“This project has been so rewarding, and a tremendous, shared learning experience to get to where we are today,” said Barbara Jiménez, Community Operations Officer for the County Department of Homeless Solutions & Equitable Communities. “It is a testament to how collaboration can lead to successful results in a short amount of time and will be a model for future projects.”
If you come in contact with someone in need of a referral to this new Safe Parking facility, please call (619) 980-4168 or email HSEC-OHS.HHSA@sdcounty.ca.gov.

1082,All San Diego Emergency Departments now Officially Senior-friendly,"Officials from the County’s Health and Human Services Agency, local hospitals and healthcare agencies gathered Thursday to celebrate the county becoming the first in the nation to earn a regionwide “senior-friendly” emergency department accreditation for all 18 of its hospitals.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209215,2022-08-11T16:31:28-07:00,"
Officials from the County’s Health and Human Services Agency, local hospitals and healthcare agencies gathered Thursday to celebrate the county becoming the first in the nation to earn a regionwide “senior-friendly” emergency department accreditation for all 18 of its hospitals.
The geriatric emergency department accreditation means that emergency room visits will be more effective and less stressful for local seniors. Elderly patients make nearly one-third of all local emergency room visits. The geriatric emergency departments are designed to treat and care for seniors and the unique medical complications they may present when they come to emergency rooms. Those include frailty and mobility issues, dementias and the use of multiple medications for chronic medical conditions.
The ERs also feature staff trained and dedicated to emergency care for older adults including nurses, case managers and social workers. The accreditation means 100% of seniors in the county will have access to senior-friendly emergency room care. Officials said only about 15% of seniors have that access nationwide.
The regional geriatric emergency department accreditation effort was part of the San Diego Senior Emergency Care Initiative, a first-of-its kind public-private partnership spearheaded by the County of San Diego and West Health at the end of 2019 as part of the County’s inaugural Aging Roadmap.

1084,Board Paves Way for New Investments into Mental Health Resources,The County Board of Supervisors today voted unanimously to accept two grants that will allow the County to make significant investments into behavioral health services.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209232,2022-08-16T16:51:43-07:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors today voted unanimously to accept two grants that will allow the County to make significant investments into behavioral health services.
The grants include $12.4 million of Behavioral Health Continuum Infrastructure Program Launch Ready Grant funding from the California Department of Health Care Services and $1.2 million of Mental Health Student Services Act funding from the Mental Health Services Oversight & Accountability Commission.
Acute Psychiatric Services
The first grant will pay for the construction of a new 12-bed acute psychiatric unit within the existing Edgemoor Distinct Part Skilled Nursing Facility in Santee. Edgemoor provides long-term skilled nursing care for individuals with complex medical needs who require specialized interventions from highly trained staff.
The new services will support Edgemoor residents in receiving the specialty psychiatric care they need, in close proximity to where they live. The addition will also improve access to care for other adults in need of acute psychiatric services in East County.
Once construction is completed, the new acute psychiatric unit is expected to connect people to community-based care, diverting them from unnecessary hospitalization.
Youth Mental Health
The second grant will make significant investments into suicide prevention programs for young people. The grant will allow the County to enhance the existing Creating Opportunities in Preventing and Eliminating Suicide, or COPES program.
COPES is a suicide prevention and mental health wellness education program that makes suicide prevention resources and information more accessible for school staff, students, and families.
Tuesday’s Board action will allow schools to hire additional mental health personnel, provide professional development for school staff, and support other strategies that respond to the mental health needs of children and youth.
“The funding from these grants will support the department in advancing efforts to transform the behavioral health continuum of care by enhancing services for some of the most vulnerable populations in our region,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “They are important parts of our continuing work to expand and normalize the delivery of behavioral health care in our region.”

1085,Novavax Offers More Traditional COVID-19 Vaccine Option,San Diegans now have a more traditional option when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. The protein-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is widely available across the region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209238,2022-08-18T16:01:59-07:00,"
San Diegans now have a more traditional option when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines. The protein-based Novavax COVID-19 vaccine is widely available across the region.
You can get Novavax at local healthcare providers, retail pharmacies, and community clinics, as well as County public health centers and community vaccination events. You can now make an appointment or find a walk-in clinic here.
While the Novavax vaccine is not showing up as available in some online appointment systems, all County of San Diego locations have it in stock for anyone who asks, regardless of which vaccine was selected during scheduling.
Novavax has been authorized as a two-dose primary series, given three to eight weeks apart, to people ages 18 and older. Clinical trials showed that the vaccine series is 90% effective at preventing mild, moderate and severe COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed using protein-based technology, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has been using for decades to treat diseases such as hepatitis B, shingles and human papillomavirus. The vaccine presents a specific portion of the virus which the body generates immunity against.
“Novavax is another vaccine option we have to slowing the spread of COVID-19,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It represents a new choice for the prevention of serious complications from COVID.”
Right now, Novavax is only available to people who have not received any of the other COVID-19 vaccines. It is not yet authorized as a booster shot for people who have previously been vaccinated with Pfizer, Moderna or Janssen.
Everyone 6 months and older can get one of the four available COVID-19 vaccines at no cost. For those who received an mRNA vaccine, mRNA boosters are available for people 5 years and older. Parental consent is required for all eligible minors to be vaccinated.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 3.01 million or 90% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.66 million or 79.7%.
Boosters administered: 1,437,457 or 58.8% of 2,443,652 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

11 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Aug. 11, 2022. The region’s total is 5,448.
Of the 11 additional deaths, one was a woman and ten were men. They died between July 28 and Aug. 12, 2022; eight deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Eight of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s and one was in their 40s.
Nine were fully vaccinated and two were not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

2,134 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past three days (Aug. 15 to Aug. 17, 2022). The region’s total is now 903,885.
5,285 cases were reported in the past week (Aug. 11 through Aug. 17) compared to 7,045 infections identified the previous week (Aug. 4 through Aug. 10).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 43.35 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 27.54 for fully vaccinated people and 85.20 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
8,783 tests were reported to the County on Aug. 13, and the percentage of new positive cases was 8.9% (Data through Aug. 13).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Aug. 13, is 11.0%.

1086,County Distributing More Than 700 Vials Of Mpox Vaccine,The County of San Diego is distributing 705 vials of Mpox (monkeypox) vaccine this week to healthcare providers around the region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209254,2022-08-22T17:56:27-07:00,"
The County of San Diego is distributing 705 vials of Mpox (monkeypox) vaccine this week to healthcare providers around the region.
The vials will be used for the newly authorized intradermal procedure, allowing up to five doses from a single vial, which initially equaled a single dose. Some individuals, including those who are less than 18 years-old or who are immunocompromised, will still require a full-vial dose.
These vaccines are being made available from County reserves.
With the vials being distributed this week, healthcare providers are expected to independently notify patients who qualify for the vaccine and then schedule vaccination appointments. These appointments are not being made by the County or through 2-1-1.
In addition, County Public Health Clinics began making a limited number of daily Mpox vaccinations available Monday through the state of California’s MyTurn appointment system. All available appointments were reserved this morning. The MyTurn system is familiar to the public for its role in scheduling COVID-19 vaccinations. The County Public Health Centers will continue to vaccinate those who have a documented exposure, and to serve individuals without a healthcare provider.
“Being able to expand the number of doses through the intradermal procedure is going to help us vaccinate many more eligible San Diegans,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Because the overall supply of vaccine remains extremely short of what is needed, we will continue to request additional doses from the state. In the meantime, we ask those at high risk to be cautious about their partners and have any signs of monkeypox immediately checked out by a physician.”
California allocates vaccines to counties based on the number of Mpox cases in the county in the past two weeks, as well as the number of early syphilis cases in men reported in a region. The County is expecting another 990 vials of the vaccine to arrive from the state soon.
A text message alert system is available for those seeking the latest information about monkeypox in the region. To sign up to receive the messages, text COSD MONKEYPOX to 468-311.
For more information on monkeypox, how to prevent it, and who should get vaccinated, visit the County’s Mpox website or call 2-1-1. The County is following California Department of Public Health guidance in transitioning the name of the virus from monkeypox to Mpox.

1087,IMAGE: Mexican Fruit Fly Quarantine Declared in Valley Center,Mexican Fruit Fly Quarantine Declared in Valley Center,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209264,2022-08-23T14:35:54-07:00,"
The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) declared a 77-square-mile quarantine covering Valley Center and surrounding areas on August 19 after discovering several Mexican fruit flies (MXFF), an agricultural pest that can infect more than 50 types of fruit, including citrus, avocados, and a wide variety of tropical fruit.

CDFA officials said anyone growing or packing “host” fruit inside the quarantine area — commercially or in private yards — are urged not to move fruit off their properties. Local residents and home gardeners affected by the quarantine should consume homegrown produce on-site, to include canning, freezing or juicing and should not move host items from their property. Residents with questions are encouraged to call the consumer hotline at (800) 491-1899.
Fruit on the host list include all types of tropical citrus, but also includes certain varieties of avocados, guava, pomegranate, and many exotic fruits that are grown in the area.
As of Aug. 19, 2022, the quarantine area is bordered on the north by Pauma Valley; on the south by Lake Wohlford; on the west by the Moosa Canyon; and on the east by Rincon Reservation.
As the lead agency for a quarantine in California, CDFA is the designated point of contact for quarantine inquiries. CDFA will also conduct informational meetings with commercial growers, nurseries, packinghouses and residents inside the quarantine area.
The County Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM) supports CDFA during a quarantine to help prevent the spread of the detected pest and any expansion of the quarantine area. AWM has alerted area agriculture stakeholders of the findings, including the San Diego County Farm Bureau, and as the host County, will assist CDFA with outreach and facilitation of grower meetings. The County will also work with growers adjacent to the quarantine area to help lessen the impact of a potential quarantine expansion and is responsible for regulating all pesticide use.
Mexican fruit flies, which are larger than a house fly, can wreak expensive agricultural destruction. Countywide, the 2020 crop value of MXFF hosts in San Diego County is $306 million.  Within the quarantine boundaries, that value is $49M of San Diego County’s $1.8 billion total agricultural value.
Female flies inject their eggs inside ripening fruit. Hatched larvae then eat the fruit’s flesh, causing it to rot and drop to the ground. Larvae crawl out of the rotting fruit and into the ground to pupate. Adult flies emerge from the ground in 12 to 100-days, depending on temperatures. A single female fly can lay several thousand eggs in their lifetime.
Media inquiries should be directed to CDFA’s Public Information Officer Steve Lyle at Officeofpublicaffairs@cdfa.ca.gov  or 916-654-0462.

1088,VIDEO: Behavioral Health Workforce Symposium Addresses Lack of Qualified Workers,A new report presented to the County of San Diego by the San Diego Workforce Partnership found far fewer behavioral health workers in our region than necessary to meet demand.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209286,2022-08-23T16:18:44-07:00,"
A new report presented to the County of San Diego by the San Diego Workforce Partnership found far fewer behavioral health workers in our region than necessary to meet demand. The shortage is expected to multiply over the next five years. Today, the County assembled a panel of behavioral health leaders, educators, and workers to discuss the report’s findings and respond to recommendations on how to retain the workforce needed to provide the highest quality of behavioral health services possible to San Diego residents.
The report estimates the region is short up to 8,000 workers of what is currently needed to meet the mental health and substance use disorder treatment needs of San Diego County residents. Our region needs to educate, train, attract, employ and retain 18,500 additional professionals over the next five years to address current demands, replace open positions and keep pace with the population growth.

The County of San Diego is holding two Mpox (Jynneos) vaccination events this week in the South County in addition to providing 250 vaccinations throughout the week at County clinics.
More than 1,000 appointments were announced through the County Mpox text service this morning about 10 a.m. and were filled an hour later. The appointments were made through the state’s MyTurn vaccination site at myturn.ca.gov.
The two South County events are on Wednesday, Aug. 31 and Thursday, Sept. 1, between 1 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. each day.
About 400 doses will be provided each day. The event location is Chula Vista Bayfront Park, 980 Marina Way, 91910, adjacent to and just north of the boat launch
Vaccinations will be given by intradermal injection.  The move to intradermal vaccinations allows up to five doses from a single vial, which formerly equaled a single dose. The California Department of Public Health recommends intradermal injection, except for people who have a history of developing keloid scars and people under the age of 18, both of whom would still require subcutaneous injection. People who are immunocompromised can receive intradermal injection.
Appointments are expected to be released next week for a vaccination event in the North County.
The County appointments are in addition to those made available by healthcare providers to their patients who qualify for the vaccine and are scheduled directly by the provider. These provider appointments are not being made by the County or through 2-1-1 and are subject to vaccine availability.
“As vaccine becomes available, the County will continue its efforts to vaccinate as many of those eligible as possible given the shortage of supply,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “We will continue to request additional doses from the state. We continue to advise those at high risk to be cautious about their partners and those who have any signs of monkeypox to immediately get checked out by a physician.”

1091,Exercise Safety Precautions for High Fire Danger,The National Weather Services has issued a prolonged heat wave through Labor Day and that creates an elevated fire risk.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/exercise-safety-precautions-for-high-fire-danger/,2022-08-30T14:37:35-07:00,"
The National Weather Services has issued a prolonged heat wave through Labor Day and that creates an elevated fire risk.
County emergency officials are offering the following tips to reduce the fire risk.
People are asked to avoid using power tools to clear away brush because it can spark a fire.
People interested in protecting their property from the threat of brush fires can instead do these things:

Remove debris, including dried leaves, firewood stacks, or trash from around the home. This includes leaves on their roof and in gutters.
Trim away any tree branches that overhang on your home and cut low branches on trees without using power tools.
Dried out bushes or plants should also be pruned or removed.
All tree or shrub clippings need to be cleaned up and disposed of in a bin.

People can also prevent accidentally starting a brush fire by heeding these warnings:

Be particularly careful with smoking materials to avoid accidentally starting a fire.
Never pull your vehicle over in grass as it can ignite a grass fire. Make sure your vehicle is well maintained as faulty catalytic converters have been a major cause of accidental fires in San Diego County.
Also, if you have a trailer on your vehicle, make sure the chains don’t drag on the ground while driving and spark a fire.

In the event of a fire, people should be informed of the situation and any emergency notifications:

Make sure you’re registered for AlertSanDiego, the County’s cell phone notification service. By doing that, you will receive any emergency messages that apply to your neighborhood on your cell phone.
Download the County’s SD Emergency app on your smart phone from the Google Play store or the Apple App Store. The app provides news updates, maps, shelter locations and includes disaster planning templates and interactive checklists. If a regional emergency, such as a wildfire, does occur, updates and other information will be posted at sdcountyemergency.com and sent out via the app.
Complete a family disaster plan template from the app or rom ReadySanDiego.org to help your family plan for an emergency including where to meet if you are separated and cannot return home. The site has more information about safeguarding your home from wildfires and general disaster preparation.

1092,How to Stay Cool in the Prolonged Heat Wave,Higher than normal temperatures building through the week are expected at the coast and inland valleys of San Diego County starting Tuesday through the holiday weekend.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/how-to-stay-cool-in-the-prolonged-heat-wave/,2022-08-30T15:33:46-07:00,"
Higher than normal temperatures building through the week are expected at the coast and inland valleys of San Diego County starting Tuesday through the holiday weekend.
The National Weather Service in San Diego has issued an excessive heat warning calling for triple digits temperatures in some inland areas and the deserts and is expected to last through Labor Day, Mon., Sept. 5.
Cool Zones are open during the day at San Diego County libraries. On Monday, three libraries will open Cool Zone community rooms from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The three library branches are Ramona, 1275 Main St, Ramona, CA 92065; Borrego Springs, 2580 Country Club Rd, Borrego Springs, CA 92004; and Valley Center: 29200 Cole Grade Rd, Valley Center, CA 92082. Please note that regular library services will not be available. Click here to see hours and locations for County libraries. Community centers and other community buildings may also offer air conditioning for residents.
“The prolonged heat with little relief at night could pose a risk for those most prone to heat stress like older adults, infants and children, and people with chronic medical conditions,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D. M.P.H., County public health officer. “People included in these groups are encouraged to take extra precautions and protect children from the effects of the heat. People are also encouraged to check on older family or neighbors, and pets to make sure they are not feeling ill from the heat.”
County health officials offer the following tips:

Stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day.
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing.
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty.
Take cool showers.
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car.
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day.
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun.
Avoid using the oven to cook.
Avoid being out in the heat of the day.
Pet owners can exercise their pets in early morning hours or late afternoon and early evening to avoid prolonged exposure to the heat.
Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler.
Do not rely on electric fans for cooling if temperatures exceed 90 degrees.

People in San Diego County unable to get to a Cool Zone location without transportation assistance, such as older adults, people with disabilities, or people who are homebound, can call 2-1-1 to be connected to a transportation or rideshare service at no cost.
Signs of heatstroke or exhaustion include an extremely high body temperature (103 or higher), dizziness, nausea, confusion and headache. If someone shows these signs, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature, and continuing cooling efforts, and
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

1094,County’s Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities Gives Board Update,"A new County department reported Tuesday that in its first year it secured $30 million to address homelessness; provided housing options for over 4,400 people; held or took part in hundreds of community events to create equitable communities; and worked to support immigrants and refugees.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209330,2022-08-30T16:39:05-07:00,"
A new County department reported Tuesday that in its first year it secured $30 million to address homelessness; provided housing options for over 4,400 people; held or took part in hundreds of community events to create equitable communities; and worked to support immigrants and refugees.
Officials from the County’s Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities updated County supervisors on the department’s progress at Tuesday’s Board of Supervisors meeting. The department, created in July 2021 as part of the County Health and Human Services Agency, is comprised of three separate offices, homeless solutions, equitable communities and immigrant and refugee affairs.
Officials said Tuesday that the department continues collaborative efforts to secure additional funding to support vulnerable populations including people experiencing homelessness, underserved communities, immigrants, migrants and refugees in the region.
The Department shared its first-year accomplishments, which included creating the County’s first Safe Parking site for people experiencing homelessness in East County. The Department worked with the City of San Diego and the Lucky Duck Foundation to create the 150 emergency-bed Rosecrans Shelter that will provide behavioral health services onsite.
The Department also has new programs that offer housing options and supportive services for people with disabilities, justice-involved people with behavioral health and physical health needs, veterans, elderly and young people.
The department’s Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs created a task force to support Afghan evacuees in San Diego. And the Department’s Community Health and Engagement Teams took part in more than 240 community events and connected more than 12,300 people to County resources. The department also added Community Health Workers as permanent department staff to provide essential linkages to County services in underserved communities.
“Following a reorganization of resources and with support from the Board of Supervisors, the new Department of Homeless Solution and Equitable Communities was able over the last year to make a positive impact, ensure equity and connect thousands of San Diegans to housing and other essential resources” said Barbara Jiménez, the department’s Community Operations Officer. “While much remains to be done, we are confident that our team is poised to continue its efforts to ensure equity in delivering necessary services and help to underserved communities.”
In receiving the report Tuesday, County Supervisors also voted unanimously to direct the department to take action to accept a $2 million allocation of Afghan refugee supplemental funding from the California Department of Social Services. Officials said San Diego County is one of only four counties to receive the allocation.
Some of the additional accomplishments the department reported Tuesday included:

Received $8 million for the Housing Disability Advocacy Program to provide help, housing and legal support to people with disabilities who are experiencing homelessness.
Worked with the County’s Public Safety Group to secure $6 million under Prop. 47 to provide care coordination services to recently released justice-involved people who have mental health or substance use disorders and are at risk of homelessness.
Community Health Workers participated in close to 100 events and connected over 4,600 people to County services.
Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs worked with First 5 San Diego to successfully apply for a $423,000 First 5 California Refugee Family Support Grant.
Worked to engage and connect migrants, immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees from all places, including Afghanistan and the Ukraine, with legal, medical, academic and food resources.

1097,Tuberculosis Case Reported In Transit Rider,A passenger using the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has been diagnosed with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) according to San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA).,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209367,2022-09-01T14:25:50-07:00,"
A passenger using the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has been diagnosed with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) according to San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA).
HHSA is working with MTS officials to notify individuals who were possibly exposed. Riders using the following routes between Feb. 16 to July 16 were potentially exposed and are at risk for infection:

Bus route 950 from Otay Mesa Transit Center toward Iris Avenue Transit Center Monday through Friday between 4:30 a.m. to 6 a.m.
Bus route 950 from Iris Avenue Transit Center to Otay Mesa Transit Center from 3p.m. to 5 p.m.
Blue Line Trolley from Iris Avenue to H Street from 5 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.
Blue Line Trolley from H Street to Iris Avenue from 2:30 p.m. to 5 p.m.

Potentially affected passengers are advised to consult with their medical provider or contact Public Health to arrange testing.
MTS employees identified will be tested by their occupational health program.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County Public Health Officer. “Most people who are exposed do not develop the disease and TB can be treated and cured with medication.”
For people with symptoms of TB, or who are immune compromised, it is important they see their medical provider to rule out TB.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure are asked to call the County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.
The number of annual TB cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 264 cases reported in 2019, 192 cases in 2020 and 201 cases of tuberculosis disease reported in 2021. To date, 97 cases have been reported in 2022.

The County of San Diego anticipates receiving the new COVID-19 bivalent boosters early next week and beginning vaccinations shortly thereafter.
The new bivalent boosters were developed to generate an immune response from the original COVID-19 virus and BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants. The Pfizer/BioNTech is for those age 12 and over, while the Moderna bivalent booster is for those age 18 and older.
“These new boosters are a welcome resource to our ongoing COVID-19 prevention efforts,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The virus remains very prevalent in our community. With this bivalent vaccine, we have an updated booster that more directly addresses the most common circulating variant, and a chance to better protect our community. I encourage everyone eligible to get boosted.”
Individuals may contact their healthcare provider or other vaccine provider, such as a pharmacy, for other local availability. Availability at County vaccine events will be updated on coronavirus-sd.com and appointments can be made through the state’s My Turn system. Initial supplies are expected to be limited.
Similar to last year, the boosters will be offered along with the flu vaccine. Vaccinations with the former booster have ended as it is no longer authorized. The new booster will serve as the replacement.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 3.01 million or 90.2% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.66 million or 79.8%.
Boosters administered: 1,445,743 or 59% of 2,450,225 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Eight additional deaths were reported since the last report on Aug. 25, 2022. The region’s total is 5,464.
Of the eight additional deaths, four were women and four were men. They died between July 22, 2022 and Aug. 26, 2022; five deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Five of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s and one was in their 60s.

1100,Stay Cool This Holiday Weekend and Out of the ER,"Extreme heat is expected at the coast and inland valleys of San Diego County this Labor Day weekend and into early next week.

Extreme heat is expected at the coast and inland valleys of San Diego County this Labor Day weekend and into early next week. The National Weather Service in San Diego has issued an excessive heat warning calling for triple digits temperatures in some inland areas and the deserts through Tuesday, Sept. 6.
San Diegans need to stay informed and protect themselves to prevent heat-related illness and to avoid hospitalization. Holiday weekends are a traditionally busy time in emergency departments. Dangerous heat conditions can add to the volume of people visiting the ED and strain hospital staff and resources.
“Check weather forecasts, stay hydrated, limit time outdoors, check on elderly or disabled neighbors, and visit Cool Zones,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D. M.P.H., County public health officer. “Signs of heat exhaustion include heavy sweating, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, clammy skin and muscle cramps. Heatstroke symptoms include fever, flushed or red skin, lack of sweating, trouble breathing and disorientation or confusion.”
A list of Cool Zones locations is available online. People can enter their address once they navigate to the map and it will show locations near them. Residents can also call 2-1-1 to find a location.
On Monday, three libraries will open Cool Zone community rooms from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The three library branches are Ramona, 1275 Main St, Ramona, CA 92065; Borrego Springs, 2580 Country Club Rd, Borrego Springs, CA 92004; and Valley Center: 29200 Cole Grade Rd, Valley Center, CA 92082. Please note that regular library services will not be available.
Prolonged heat with little relief at night can pose a substantial health risk for young children, the elderly, people with chronic diseases, pregnant individuals, people with disabilities, and people who are socially isolated. Family pets are also vulnerable to the extreme heat. County health officials offer the following tips:

Stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day.
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing.
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty.
Take cool showers.
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car.
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day.
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun.
Avoid using the oven to cook.
Avoid being out during peak heat hours.
Pet owners can exercise their pets in early morning hours or early evening to avoid prolonged exposure to the heat. Make sure they have shade throughout the day and plenty of water.
Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler.
Do not rely on electric fans for cooling if temperatures exceed 90 degrees.

People in San Diego County unable to get to a Cool Zone location without transportation assistance, such as older adults, people with disabilities, or people who are homebound, can call 2-1-1 to be connected to a transportation or rideshare service at no cost.
If someone is showing signs of heat-related illness, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature, and continuing cooling efforts, and
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

The hot temperatures are here to stay for a few more days and the County is reminding San Diegans that close to 100 Cool Zones are available throughout the region.
The National Weather Service just extended an excessive heat warning through Friday and triple digit temperatures are expected in some inland areas and the deserts.
To help San Diegans stay cool during the heat wave, the County and its partners have opened 97 Cool Zones throughout the region. People can enter their address once they navigate to the map and it will show locations near them.
Residents can also call 2-1-1 to request information about Cool Zones, or schedule a free ride to a Cool Zone near them if they don’t have access to transportation.
“Extreme heat poses a risk to individuals of all ages, especially seniors, young children and people with disabilities, so check on family members who are at higher risk of heat-related illness,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Familiarize yourself with the signs of heat exhaustion and make a plan for yourself and your loved ones.”
County health officials offer the following tips to stay cool:

Stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day.

1102,Emergency Alert Tests Scheduled in San Diego County,The County Office of Emergency Services and the City of Chula Vista will be testing the Wireless Emergency Alert system next week. Wireless Emergency Alerts are a critical tool used to alert communities during an emergency or disaster.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209402,2022-09-07T08:56:57-07:00,"
The County Office of Emergency Services and the City of Chula Vista will be testing the Wireless Emergency Alert system next week.
Wireless Emergency Alerts are a critical tool used to alert communities during an emergency or disaster.  The Wireless Emergency Alert system is used to send text messages to cell phones in a specific area. The messages are sent to your mobile phone or other mobile device when you may be in harm’s way.
The City of Chula Vista will conduct a test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system Monday, September 12, 2022, at 3 p.m. and the text alert will be sent to phones near the Chula Vista Police Department located at 315 4th Ave., Chula Vista, CA 91910.
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services will conduct a test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system Tuesday, September 13, 2022, at 3 p.m., near Julian.
The test message will go to all cell phones set up to receive “Public Safety Alerts” on their devices.  To see if you will receive alerts on your phone, check the Notifications folder on your device.
The test message will read “TEST. Go to https://www.fcc.gov/wea to provide feedback on your receipt of this test.”  The tests will target small areas but could be received by devices up to 10 miles away.
The test of the Wireless Emergency Alert system takes place during September, which is National Disaster Preparedness month.  San Diegans are urged to make a personal disaster plan, so you are better prepared for emergencies or disasters.  Your family should build a kit with items needed in case you need to evacuate your family and pets.  And stay informed by signing up for AlertSanDiego, the County’s emergency notification system. For more helpful disaster preparedness tips, visit ReadySanDiego.org.
WEAs can be sent to your mobile device without the need to download an app or subscribe to a service. WEAs are messages that warn the public of an impending natural or human-made disaster. First responders may advise you to evacuate or to remain in place. The messages are short and can provide immediate, life-saving information.

1103,"Hurricane Could Bring Significant Rain; Get Sandbags from County, CAL FIRE",Weather forecasters say a hurricane off the coast of Mexico could indirectly bring high winds with potentially heavy rain to the county this weekend.

Weather forecasters say a hurricane off the coast of Mexico could indirectly bring high winds with potentially heavy rain to the county this weekend, and County of San Diego and CAL FIRE are offering free sandbags to residents who live in the unincorporated areas.
Weather forecasters say Hurricane Kay, which is forming off the coast Mexico, will not directly hit San Diego County, but could still bring high winds Thursday and potentially “significant” rains starting Friday.
As they have in the past, the County and CAL FIRE are providing free bags and/or sand at numerous fire stations for people who live in the unincorporated areas.
Rain can cause flooding and erosion, particularly in areas that are not covered by plants, landscaping, grass and trees. Rain runoff can sweep topsoil, mud, plant material and debris off land and downstream where it can damage homes, clog culverts and storm drains, and flood and damage roadways.
Sand and bags, or bags alone, will be available for unincorporated residents at the fire stations located below.
People should call ahead to double-check availability and remember to bring a shovel to fill the bags. Some stations may have a limited supply.

Opening/closing a vote center
Processing voters
Answering voter questions

To become a poll worker, applicants must be 18 years old, a U.S citizen and registered to vote in California, or lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States. Applicants must also provide their own transportation to their assigned vote center.
The Registrar is seeking people who are team players, exhibit strong leadership and customer service skills, and display flexibility, patience and the highest level of integrity at all times. Poll workers must represent the Registrar of Voters in a professional, nonpartisan manner.
The Registrar’s office is working with Public Health Services to ensure the health and safety of election workers and voters. Recommended personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies will be provided to workers so they can conduct the election process safely.
To be a poll worker, you must apply online. For more information, email pollworker@sdcounty.ca.gov.

It’s raining doggies at the San Diego County Department of Animal Services. In August, a national Clear the Shelters campaign resulted in 142 dogs, 210 cats, and 29 other animals being adopted out from the County shelters, but as those went out, more animals continued coming in. Due to the Border 32 Fire, the County’s Bonita and Carlsbad shelters took in 67 dogs and 10 cats as well as 34 other animals.
Luckily, some of those animals are just being held temporarily and will be going home soon, but not all are that fortunate.
“We provide the best care possible to all our animals when they are in our care, but it’s not a home. Even with our efforts, the dogs and pets may heal physically, if they come to us with injuries or sickness, but they can’t truly thrive in this environment,” said Kelly Campbell, director of County Animal Services. “Our staff and the volunteers who care for the animals want these animals to have their best lives with a family or person. So, we are asking people to consider meeting and adopting or fostering one of our animals.”
Most of the animals who are available for adoption can be adopted for no fee, including many dogs and cats that have been there for a long time.
Caring for animals often gives people a sense of higher purpose. Dogs and cats can help reduce stress, anxiety, depression and loneliness. Sometimes, they can even improve their owner’s cardiovascular health by encouraging exercise with walks and playfulness.
The County Shelters have some wonderful longer-stay dogs and other pets who are still full of hope that they too will soon have a family or person of their own. Among them are these staff and volunteer favorites who would make great companions and snuggle-buddies, in some cases.
    

Peter Parker is a 2-year-old brown brindle neutered pit bull. He loves treats.
Henry is a neutered black and white border collie mix. He has been at the shelter since April. He’s playful and like’s people’s attention as well as food!
Zeus, a 3-year-old Dalmatian and Labrador retriever mix neutered male and has been at the shelter since June.
Venus is a black and tan 1-year-old spayed German shepherd. She is high energy and food motivated. She needs some training but would love an active family to call her own.
Miles is a 6-year-old neutered Siberian husky. He has been at the shelter since June 2021 and he needs an active family. He’d love to be someone’s hiking partner.
Tulip is a 5-year-old spayed female pit bull and has been at the shelter since January.
Gabbie is a 5-year-old spayed Manchester terrier mix.

All of these featured dogs are at the South (Bonita) Shelter. Adopt by going to the Department of Animal Services office at 5821 Sweetwater Road, Bonita, CA 91902, (619) 767-2675. Or go online to browse and download an application for a different animal or for the North (Carlsbad) shelter.
Remember adoption fees will be waived on most of the animals who have had longer stays.
If you cannot adopt but have some room at home for a temporary roommate, consider fostering a pet.

1107,New COVID-19 Boosters That Target Multiple Strains Now Available,"The new COVID-19 bivalent boosters have arrived in San Diego County and limited supplies are now available at vaccination locations across the region, including pharmacies and medical providers.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209455,2022-09-08T16:57:11-07:00,"
The new COVID-19 bivalent boosters have arrived in San Diego County and limited supplies are now available at vaccination locations across the region, including pharmacies and medical providers.
The new bivalent boosters were developed to generate an immune response from the original COVID-19 virus, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants.
The Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent booster is available for individuals age 12 and older, while the Moderna bivalent booster is for those age 18 and older. The bivalent boosters have not yet been authorized for children under the age of 12. Youths in that age group can get boosted with the previous version of the monovalent Pfizer vaccine.
San Diegans need to be fully vaccinated before receiving the new booster, meaning they must have received the two-dose primary series of Pfizer, Moderna, or Novavax, or at least one shot of the Janssen vaccine. These vaccinations are still widely available. Anyone who received a previous COVID-19 vaccine less than two months ago can get the bivalent booster shot eight weeks after their last shot.
“These new boosters are safe and effective at protecting people against the Omicron variants, which are currently causing the majority of new infections in our region,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Supplies of the bivalent vaccine will initially be limited, so we ask anyone who is planning to get the new booster to be patient.”
Initially, County doses will be available at four County-operated locations:
South Region Live Well Center
150 doses a day
690 Oxford St, Chula Vista, 91911
10 a.m. to 5:30 P.M.
East Public Health Center
60 doses a day
367 N. Magnolia Ave, El Cajon, 92020
8:30 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.
Central Region Public Health Center
60 doses a day
5202 University Ave, San Diego, 92105
8:30 a.m. to 3:15 p.m.
North Inland Public Health Center
60 doses a day
649 W. Mission Ave, Escondido 92025
9:45 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
The bivalent boosters will be available in the state’s My Turn system in the near future and will be given on a first-come, first-serve basis. While the initial shipments of the vaccine have been limited, the County expects more doses to arrive in the coming days and weeks, with the next shipment expected to arrive as soon as Friday afternoon.
More information about County vaccine locations is available at coronavirus-sd.com or by calling 2-1-1.
Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: Close to 3.02 million or 90.3% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.67 million or 79.9%.
Boosters administered: 1,446,706 or 59% of 2,452,870 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

10 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Sept. 1, 2022. The region’s total is 5,474.
Of the 10 additional deaths, five were women and five were men. They died between Feb. 28, 2022 and Aug. 30, 2022; six deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Seven of the people who died were 80 years or older, one was in their 70s and two were in their 60s.
Six were fully vaccinated and four were not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

881 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past two days (Sept. 6 to Sept. 7, 2022). The region’s total is now 915,474.
2,797 cases were reported in the past week (Sept. 1 through Sept. 7) compared to 3,978 infections identified the previous week (Aug. 25 through Aug. 31).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 21.53 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 13.15 for fully vaccinated people and 42.24 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
6,347 tests were reported to the County on Sept. 3, and the percentage of new positive cases was 5.6% (Data through Sept. 3).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Sept. 3, is 6.9%.

1109,Library Laptops Help Bridge the Digital Divide,"San Diego County’s 33 branch libraries have added something new to the books, movies, and music they lend to the public – 7,000 sets of Chromebook computers and hotspots to support people in need of digital access.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209462,2022-09-13T08:48:31-07:00,"
San Diego County’s 33 branch libraries have added something new to the books, movies, and music they lend to the public – 7,000 sets of Chromebook computers and hotspots to support people in need of digital access.
This TechConnect program, funded by a $4.3 million federal grant from the Emergency Connectivity Fund (EFC), will help people access the internet.
“This is great example of how the library creatively responds to serve our community, said County Library Director Migell Acosta. “These resources provide important online access that can support education, healthcare services, employment options and connect them to a myriad of County services.”
While supplies last, San Diego County Library (SDCL) customers can check out an ASUS Chromebook C204, ATT Moxee Hotspot device, and charging cables free of charge for up to one year. They are available at any SDCL branch to people with a SDCL library card. Customers are also required to sign a form saying they do not have sufficient equipment or services to access the internet. Minors need to have a parent or caregiver compete the form to check out a set.
The program started in June, and more than 3,000 have been distributed by branches and through local community organizations helping SDCL identify people with the greatest need. The community feedback has been positive. A young mother from the Lakeside Branch told library staff that the program was life-changing, and an unsheltered customer said she hopes it will enable her to find a job. You can visit your local SDCL branch to check out a TechConnect set today or learn more at sdcl.org/techconnect.
The program is just one of many ways the County is closing the digital divide in the region. Additional efforts include a comprehensive broadband plan to help prioritize and guide connectivity solutions in the unincorporated areas, a partnership with Caltrans and SANDAG to underground fiber optic cable along 22 miles of SR 67, and a  sponsorship of SANDAG’s GetConnected campaign.

1110,Support Provided to Border 32 Fire Survivors,"County Emergency Services opened a Local Assistance Center Monday to support those affected by the Border 32 Fire.  The fire damaged 4,400 homes and destroyed more than a dozen homes and buildings in the area between Dulzura and Potrero.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209469,2022-09-13T16:55:27-07:00,"
County Emergency Services opened a Local Assistance Center Monday to support those affected by the Border 32 Fire.  The fire burned 4,400 acres and destroyed more than a dozen homes and buildings in the area between Dulzura and Potrero.
More than 50 families took advantage of the services offered by the County, State, American Red Cross, and other non-governmental agencies. Residents who lost everything were able to get help with services such as debris removal and building permits to medical care services and help with pets and animals.
The American Red Cross provided survivor case management and assigned each a person to help walk them through the process of rebuilding.
“An event like this helps start the healing process after a disaster like a wildfire,” said County Emergency Services Director Jeff Toney.  “It is a very stressful time for survivors, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it. They could live on a property prone to debris and mudflow, so we can offer erosion control assistance.  Others may need mental health resources.”
District 2 Supervisor Joel Anderson attended the Local Assistance Center to thank the staff and volunteers in person. The Supervisor was also briefed on the fire.
“I want to thank the County Office of Emergency Services for working with County staff and CAL FIRE to bring so many recovery resources for victims of the Border 32 fire who are going through such a difficult time after losing their homes,” said Supervisor Joel Anderson, who represents Dulzura and Potrero in District 2. “I would also like to thank all the state agencies and non-governmental organizations for volunteering their time to help this community recover from the Border 32 Fire. To anyone impacted by the fire, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office and we will do whatever we can to assist you.”
The County Department of Animal Services was also at the assistance center offering help and free food for pets affected by the fire.  Animal Services officers helped evacuate and care for dozens of animals during the wildfire.  The County shelter staff cared for common pets like dogs and cats, but also parrots, tortoises, horses, goats and pigs throughout the disaster.

September is National Recovery Month and the County and its partners are once again putting on a special event to help support individuals in recovery, those exploring recovery options, and the loved ones who support them.
The 32nd annual Recovery Happens event takes place from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 17. The free, family-friendly event is back in person this year after a virtual stint due to the pandemic. It will be held at Liberty Station.
This year’s theme is Join the Voices for Recovery: Together We Are Stronger. The theme focuses on the need to share resources and build networks across the country to support recovery.
“Whether you are in recovery, thinking about recovery, or looking to help someone you know, this event has something for everyone,” said Luke Bergmann, director of HHSA Behavioral Health Services. “Mental health and substance use conditions impact a large percentage of the population and this event is just one way for San Diegans to be part of the solution.”
In addition to celebrating recovery journeys and sharing inspirational stories, Recovery Happens 2022 will offer a resource fair with education information, employment support, veteran’s services, financial and legal services, free HIV and Hepatitis C screenings, prevention and treatment information, community resources, and more. The event will also feature music, shared stories, and other fun activities.
Recovery Happens aligns with the County’s Comprehensive Harm Reduction Strategy, which recognizes the  harms related to substance abuse are part of overall health concerns. Responding to them requires collaborative efforts, evidence-based programming, and data-informed approaches that address community needs for recovery as we work toward a region free of substance use related harms.
Behavioral health is an essential part of overall health and wellness. It is a key component of the regional Live Well San Diego vision to ensure residents are building better health, living safely, and thriving by cultivating opportunities for all people and communities to grow, connect, and enjoy the highest quality of life.
If you or someone you care about is in crisis or would like behavioral health resources or support, including accessing Mobile Crisis Response Teams (MCRT), please call the Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 (24 hours a day, 7 days a week). Calls are answered by experienced counselors, with assistance available in over 200 languages.

1113,Bivalent Boosters Available and Encouraged,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is encouraging San Diegans to stay current on their COVID-19 vaccine doses ahead of the upcoming winter months.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209528,2022-09-15T17:12:27-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is encouraging San Diegans to stay current on their COVID-19 vaccine doses ahead of the upcoming winter months.
“COVID-19 vaccines and boosters are our best protection against the virus and I encourage anyone who is eligible for a booster to get one,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While COVID-19 numbers are currently trending down, the virus remains active and infectious in our community and we anticipate more cases in the coming months as people move activities indoors.”
So far, close to 1.45 million San Diegans have received a regular booster since they became available. The County has administered more than 400 bivalent boosters since limited supplies started arriving earlier this month, while the total from all providers has surpassed 34,000.
The new bivalent boosters were developed to generate an immune response from the original COVID-19 virus, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants. The Omicron variants are still causing the majority of new COVID-19 infections in the region.
The Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent booster is available for individuals age 12 and older. Moderna bivalent boosters are authorized for those age 18 and older, but are currently not readily available in the region as the County is awaiting additional vaccine allocations from the state.
The bivalent boosters have not yet been authorized for children under the age of 12. Youths in that age group can get boosted with the previous version of the monovalent Pfizer vaccine.
San Diegans must be fully vaccinated with the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines before receiving a bivalent booster, meaning they must have received the two-dose primary series of Pfizer, Moderna, or the relatively new Novavax. All of those vaccines remain widely available. Also eligible for the bivalent booster are those who received at least one shot of the Janssen vaccine, which is no longer widely available.
Anyone who wants to get a bivalent booster must wait at least eight weeks after they received a previous COVID-19 vaccine until they are eligible. In addition, anyone who is fully vaccinated and recently tested positive for COVID-19, should wait three months after infection to get a bivalent booster.
Data Reporting Changes
As COVID-19 activity continues to trend down in the region, and to align with the state’s reporting frequency, the County will transition to reporting COVID-19 data once a week.
Starting next week, local COVID-19 data will be updated on the coronavirus-sd.com page on Thursdays only, instead of twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays. The County’s regular COVID-19 news release will continue to be distributed once a week on Thursdays.
 Vaccination Progress:

Received at least one shot: More than 3.02 million or 90.4% of San Diegans age six months and older are at least partially vaccinated.
Fully vaccinated: More than 2.67 million or 80.0%.
Boosters administered: 1,447,477 or 59% of 2,455,439 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

1115,Prepare for Natural Disasters to Protect Your Legacy,Families and individuals work hard to establish their homes and businesses and fill them with cherished people and memories. Don’t let a natural disaster destroy your legacy.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209538,2022-09-20T11:44:40-07:00,"
Families and individuals work hard to establish their homes and businesses and fill them with cherished people and memories. Don’t let a natural disaster destroy your legacy.
“To remind everyone what is at stake, the theme for 2022’s National Preparedness Month is ‘A Lasting Legacy,’” said Jeff Toney, director of the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services. “The destructive Border 32 fire made the point earlier this month that while wildfires are a year-round threat to the San Diego region, fall is peak fire season. As we continue into the fall months, the wildfire threat will only increase as grasses and brush dry out further. This September, take time to create or review a personal disaster plan for your family.”
In addition to wildfires, San Diego faces other natural disaster hazards such as earthquakes and flooding. Communities face various levels of risk for different hazards and it is important to know your hazard risk so you can take appropriate measures to safeguard from damages. Visit the County’s ReadySanDiego’s page to launch an easy tool to determine your risk based on specific addresses.
Knowing specific hazard risks allows people to customize their personal disaster plan and possibly lower the level of risk. Some examples of this are protecting your home from embers by clearing away leaves and debris, woodpiles or other potential flammable items that could fuel a spark of fire. Or in the case of flooding, protecting your home by having sandbags on hand, if needed. Templates in 12 languages are available online to guide your family, as well as for people who may need assistance.
A personal disaster plan helps people consider how and where families will reunite if phone lines are affected and they are separated. It also helps gather important phone numbers for quick reference if phone lines are not affected. Families or individuals can plan how they would respond to an earthquake in various locations such as home, work or school, and determine which areas in each room would be safest to drop, cover and hold on in.  In the case of a house fire, families can discuss how and where to escape.
Gathering emergency supplies such as water, nonperishable food, medications, and special dietary needs as well as flashlights, batteries, a radio and first aid materials will also be a critical part of your plan. A printable list of suggested items may help guide people in putting a kit together.
Once a personal disaster plan is complete, people are more likely to minimize potential risks around their home or business and be ready to act in a stressful real-life situation, especially if the plan is discussed and practiced by all household members.
In the event of a disaster, it will be important to stay informed with official information. San Diego County offers AlertSanDiego, a mass emergency notification tool that sends information to all hard-wired home and business phones. Cell phones need to be registered to receive the alert.
Additionally, the County will also put more information out on its SD Emergency page and people can download the SD Emergency App at no cost to receive information directly to their phones. The app includes early earthquake warning capability and has a brief personal disaster plan template.

Employees and employers across the region can now learn more about workers’ rights, labor law compliance, and see which local businesses have wage theft judgments against them.
The County’s new Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement created a website that answers labor law questions on the minimum wage, meal and rest breaks, sick leave, overtime, COVID-19 vaccination requirements, workers’ compensation requirements and more.
The site also features an embedded dashboard on the status of wage claims judgments issued by the California Division of Labor Standards and Enforcement. Users can search for local employers who violated the California Labor Code, the employer’s type of industry, judgment date, and judgment amount. This site will be updated monthly.
In the near future, employers can sign up to attend free educational labor compliance trainings for businesses that will be hosted throughout the County and available virtually.
“This office and this site are important because questions regarding labor laws come up over and over again,” said Deputy Director Branden Butler. “We will be a one-stop information shop for both employees and businesses to get answers to important questions about the workplace.”
For additional information on workers’ rights and how to file a claim, you can reach the County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement through its advice line at 619-985-1597 or email OLSE@sdcounty.ca.gov.

1119,County Hosting Multiple Monkeypox Vaccination Events,"More than 2,000 JYNNEOS vaccination appointments are available this week and next week for people at risk of getting sick with monkeypox (MPOX).  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209563,2022-09-22T14:52:00-07:00,"
More than 2,000 JYNNEOS vaccination appointments are available this week and next for people at risk of getting sick with monkeypox (MPOX).
The County is holding multiple vaccination events at the Balboa Park Golden Hill Community Clubhouse and has hundreds of appointments available per day. Vaccinations are also available at Public Health Clinics in all parts of the County.
A list of where to get the vaccine by locations and dates is now available on the County MPOX website. People can sign up to receive their first or second dose of the vaccine.
Appointments can be made by visiting myturn.ca.gov.
Walk-ins are being accommodated on a limited basis at the Balboa Park Golden Hill Community Clubhouse vaccination events, with availability dependent on supply on a given day. People are still encouraged to sign up in MyTurn for an appointment.
“It’s important that people who are eligible for the vaccine, get it, so we’ve added a large location and some flexibility” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While we are seeing infection rates steadily decline, this is in part due to people getting the vaccine and being aware of risk factors.”
Large vaccination events are being held at the Balboa Park Golden Hill Community Clubhouse.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The JYNNEOS vaccine helps prevent MPOX and is available to those determined to be at high risk for the disease, including people who have been in close contact with someone with confirmed or probable MPOX and gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men with multiple partners. More information about who is eligible for the JYNNEOS vaccine is available on the County’s MPOX website.
While supply for the JYNNEOS vaccine has been limited, recent increased allocations from the California Department of Public Health and the move to administer the vaccine intradermally several weeks ago, have made it possible to vaccinate more people.
With intradermal injections, a small portion of the vaccine is administered just below the skin. The JYNNEOS vaccine is being administered on the forearm. The intradermal injection method has allowed for up to five doses to be pulled from each JYNNEOS vial instead of just one dose with the previous subcutaneous injection technique.
The County has a total of 387 confirmed or probable MPOX cases since the first case was reported on June 15.

1120,Regional Monoclonal Antibody Treatment Centers Closing as Demand Decreases,Regional Monoclonal Antibody Treatment operations are winding down as fewer San Diegans are in need of this service at this stage of the pandemic.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209578,2022-09-22T17:10:26-07:00,"
Regional Monoclonal Antibody Treatment operations are winding down as fewer San Diegans are in need of this service at this stage of the pandemic.
As the summer surge is decreasing and healthcare systems have built capacity for providing COVID-19 treatment to their patients, three of the four operating Monoclonal Antibody Regional Centers (MARCs) will close by the end of this month. Family Health Centers of San Diego will continue to provide monoclonal antibodies for prevention and for treatment, by appointment only.
Since the MARCs opened in February of 2021, nearly 15,000 patients have been treated with monoclonal antibodies at 10 locations across the region, including sites at Palomar Health, Vista Community Clinic, San Ysidro Health, Neighborhood Healthcare, Family Health Centers of San Diego, and the cities of San Diego and Chula Vista.
The development of the MARCs, prior to the availability of antiviral COVID-19 medications in pill-form, was a novel collaboration among federal, state, county, and local partners, and has received statewide recognition.
“The demand for monoclonal antibody treatment has been steadily decreasing in recent months as COVID-19 treatments, including Paxlovid, have become readily available at medical providers’ offices and other locations,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “County Public Health will continue to monitor the pandemic to ensure the community’s treatment needs are met.”
San Diegans testing positive for COVID-19 should discuss treatment options with their health care provider, especially if they are at high risk for developing severe symptoms. Individuals without a primary care provider can schedule a no-cost telehealth visit online, or call 1-800-232-0233 to find a nearby COVID Test to Treat location.
In addition to treatment, COVID vaccines are widely available across the region and offer the best protection from infection with the virus. Medical providers and County sites offer both the primary series of the COVID-19 vaccines, as well as the new bivalent boosters.
The new bivalent boosters generate an immune response from the original COVID-19 virus, as well as the BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants. The Omicron subvariants are responsible for the majority of new infections in the region and across the globe.
Anyone who is interested in getting the bivalent booster must have completed the primary series of the COVID-19 vaccine first, meaning they must have received the two-dose primary series of Pfizer, Moderna, or Novavax. Also eligible for the bivalent booster are those who received at least one shot of the Janssen vaccine.
The new bivalent boosters can be given two months after the completion of the primary vaccine series, or two months after the last monovalent booster dose. Like all COVID-19 vaccines, the bivalent booster can be given simultaneously with the flu vaccine.
The bivalent boosters have not yet been authorized for children under the age of 12. Youth ages 5-11 years can get boosted with the previous version of the monovalent Pfizer vaccine.
Vaccination Progress:

Fully vaccinated: More than 2.68 million or 80.0% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,448,515 or 58.9% of 2,458,117 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Four additional deaths were reported since the last report on Sept. 15, 2022. The region’s total is 5,487.
Of the four additional deaths, two were women and two were men. They died between Sept. 11, 2022 and Sept. 15, 2022.
Three of the people who died were 80 years or older and one was in their 70s.
All were fully vaccinated.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

2,634 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Sept. 13 to Sept. 19, 2022). The region’s total is now 919,938.
The 2,634 cases reported in the past week were slightly lower compared to the 2,840 infections identified the previous week (Sept. 8 through Sept. 14).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 14.65 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 9.25 for fully vaccinated people and 29.59 for not fully vaccinated San Diegans.
10,411 tests were reported to the County on Sept. 17, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3.4% (Data through Sept. 17).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Sept. 17, is 4.6%.

1122,Have a Plan for Staying Cool,Extreme heat is in the forecast again for next week but the County offers some relief at nearly 100 Cool Zones available throughout the region.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/have-a-plan-for-staying-cool/,2022-09-23T16:31:04-07:00,"
Extreme heat is in the forecast again for next week but the County offers some relief at nearly 100 Cool Zones available throughout the region.
The National Weather Service has put an excessive heat watch in effect from Monday morning through Wednesday evening.  The hottest conditions will be expected Monday and Tuesday in the high 90s to 100 degrees in the valleys and up to the 90s in other areas including the coast.
For those who do not have air conditioning available and need to cool off, the County and its partners have 97 Cool Zones throughout the region. To find the nearest Cool Zone, people can enter an address once they navigate to the map and it will show several locations near them.
Residents can also call 2-1-1 to request information about Cool Zones or schedule a free ride to a Cool Zone near them if they don’t have access to transportation.
“A very high body temperature can be dangerous because it can damage the brain and other vital organs. Individuals of all ages are at risk but senior, young children and people with certain medical conditions are more likely to develop heat-related illness,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer.  “Check on anyone in your family or neighborhood who may need assistance.”
County health officials offer the following tips to stay cool:

Stay in an air-conditioned area during the hottest hours of the day.
Wear light, loose-fitting clothing.
Drink plenty of water (avoid alcohol and sugary drinks) and don’t wait until you are thirsty.
Take cool showers.
Never leave a child, elderly person, or pet unattended in a car.
Avoid unnecessary hard work or activities outside during the hottest part of the day.
Avoid unnecessary sun exposure and wear a wide-brim hat if you need to be in the sun.
Avoid using the oven to cook.
Avoid being out during peak heat hours.
Pet owners can exercise their pets in early morning hours or early evening to avoid prolonged exposure to the heat. Make sure they have shade throughout the day and plenty of water.
Even a few hours spent in air conditioning can help your body stay cooler.
Do not rely on electric fans for cooling if temperatures exceed 90 degrees.

If someone is showing signs of heat-related illness, call 9-1-1 and begin cooling the individual by:

Moving them to a shaded area
Spraying with cool water and fanning them
Placing them in a cool shower if they are alert
Monitoring the body temperature, and continuing cooling efforts, and
Do not give the victim fluids to drink

1123,Supervisors Add Backcountry Water Sources for Firefighting,The Board of Supervisors today approved additional water tanks and backcountry helicopter hydrants to give firefighting helicopters more water sources during wildland firefighting.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209609,2022-09-28T08:44:31-07:00,"
The Board of Supervisors today approved additional water tanks and backcountry helicopter hydrants to give firefighting helicopters more water sources during wildland firefighting.
County Fire and CAL FIRE developed a strategy to place Heli-Hydrants and HeloPods in a ring along the northern and eastern edges of the county. The strategy identified locations within unincorporated areas that would benefit from an additional water source based on wildfire risk assessments and helicopter travel times. The goal is to give firefighters additional support to contain a fire early and avoid or lessen property damage and loss of life.

Heli-hydrants are 5,000-gallon, stationary water tanks connected to a municipal water source.  A firefighting helicopter crew can siphon water to refill the aircraft’s tank allowing more frequent water drops in areas that lack natural water sources.  The Heli-Hydrant will automatically refill so it is full for the next helicopter needing water.  In 2021, the region’s first Heli-Hydrant site was established in North County by the Rainbow Municipal Water District, through a partnership with CAL FIRE San Diego and the North County Fire Protection District.

This fall, County Fire will partner with the San Marcos Fire Department and the Vallecitos Water District to install a Heli-Hydrant in Santa Fe Hills in San Marcos. County Fire and CAL FIRE also proposed adding Heli-Hydrants at Gomez Canyon in the North County, San Elijo Hills in San Marcos, and a new fire station planned in Jacumba.

County Fire and CAL FIRE are also placing large HeloPods around the County. HeloPods are portable, 5,000-gallon pools of water that need to be manually refilled by a water tender or from a municipal water source. HeloPods provide fire crews a water source to refill the helicopters water tanks closer to a wildfire. A Heli-Pod is already in use at the CAL FIRE Station in Julian and at the CAL FIRE San Diego Unit in El Cajon.  This fall, additional HeloPods will be placed at the Rainbow Fire Center in Fallbrook, and at the McCain Valley Fire Camp in Boulevard. Future HeloPods will be placed at Crouch Valley near Mt Laguna and near the Puerta La Cruz CAL FIRE Conservation Camp near Warner Springs.

1124,"Board Approves New Climate-Housing, Vehicle Miles Traveled Rules","County supervisors approved new Vehicle-Miles-Traveled guidelines for new development in unincorporated communities Wednesday that will fight climate change and still allow approximately 7,700 homes to be built faster and without expensive traffic studies.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209624,2022-09-28T16:14:59-07:00,"
County supervisors approved new Vehicle-Miles-Traveled guidelines for new development in unincorporated communities Wednesday that will fight climate change and still allow approximately 7,700 homes to be built faster and without expensive traffic studies.
The Board’s action to adopt a new Transportation Study Guide brings County policies into synch with the state of California’s Vehicle Miles Traveled law.
That law aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and fight climate change by asking proposed developments how many miles the people living in them would have to drive on average ― to reach jobs, amenities or transit.
The Board’s vote means housing proposed in unincorporated areas where cars would travel at least 15% fewer miles than the average of all drivers in the entire county ― including city areas ― could be built without Vehicle-Miles-Traveled studies and mitigation.
That would reduce the cost and streamline the review and consideration process for “infill and vehicle-mile-traveled-efficient” development in areas that have higher housing densities and are nearer to roads, jobs and transit.
Projects proposed where drivers would have to drive 16% or more miles than the average regional driver could still be proposed, approved and built. But they would have to pay for Vehicle-Miles-Traveled studies and potential mitigation as part of their project process.
That could make it more expensive for developers to build in the County’s unincorporated areas that are often located farther away from jobs and amenities.
However, County staff calculated the new Transportation Study Guide would allow up to 7,693 homes to be built without study and mitigation within two types of unincorporated areas ― infill areas and Vehicle-Miles-Traveled efficient areas.
The Vehicle Miles Traveled efficient areas are places where people would drive 15% or fewer miles than drivers within the region. Infill areas are defined as those with already dense housing development ― with a minimum of 425 houses and 128 intersections per square mile ― and within 15 miles of job centers.
One of the intents of the state’s Vehicle Miles Traveled law was to encourage infill development that would improve public health by encouraging people to walk and bike more and reduce car travel and greenhouse gas emissions.
Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer praised County staff for creating guidelines that would immediately address the “climate crisis,” create a path to build more affordable homes and withstand legal challenge.
“We’ve come up with an approach that simultaneously gets us to more housing and protects our climate for future generations,” Lawson-Remer said.
With their vote Wednesday, the Board also directed County staff to work with other agencies to see if more Vehicle Miles Traveled efficient areas could be created in unincorporated communities by bringing mass transit to them.

1125,Active Tuberculosis Reported in Transit Rider,A passenger using the Metropolitan Transit System has been diagnosed with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis according to San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209632,2022-09-28T18:31:34-07:00,"
A passenger using the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) has been diagnosed with infectious pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) according to San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA).
HHSA is working with Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) officials to notify individuals who were possibly exposed. Riders using the following routes between Feb. 16, 2022, and Aug. 16, 2022 were potentially exposed and are at risk for infection:

Trolley Blue Line from San Ysidro to 12th and Imperial station Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.
Trolley Orange Line from 12th and Imperial to Lemon Grove Monday through Friday from 6:30 to 7 a.m.
Trolley Orange Line from Lemon Grove to 12th and Imperial Monday through Friday roughly between 4:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m.
Trolley Blue Line from 12th and Imperial to San Ysidro Monday through Friday roughly between 5:15 p.m. and 5:45 p.m.

Potentially affected passengers are advised to consult with their medical provider or contact Public Health to arrange testing.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.”
People who are infected, and people at high risk of becoming ill quickly after an infection such as those with an immunocompromising condition, should discuss treatments with a medical provider, as antibiotics can prevent people with TB infection from becoming sick.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure are asked to call the County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.
The number of annual TB cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 264 cases reported in 2019, 192 cases in 2020 and 201 cases of tuberculosis disease reported in 2021. Through the end of August, 97 cases have been reported to date in 2022.

1127,Don’t Delay – Get Vaccinated Against COVID-19 and Flu Now,The County Health and Human Services Agency is asking San Diegans to do their part in preventing illnesses this winter and schedule their COVID and flu vaccines as soon as possible.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209638,2022-09-29T16:52:22-07:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is asking San Diegans to do their part in preventing illnesses this winter and schedule their COVID and flu vaccines as soon as possible.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months or older get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu. COVID vaccines, bivalent boosters and flu shots are widely available across the region.
“Vaccines save lives and it’s safe to receive both your COVID vaccine and flu shot at the same time,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The vaccines are effective and everyone who is eligible should get vaccinated to avoid getting sick and spreading viruses to others.”
Both vaccines can be administered during the same visit and it is not recommended to delay either vaccination. The CDC recommends to get a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible and to get a flu shot by the end of October.
Who is Eligible?
The Pfizer/BioNTech bivalent COVID booster is available for anyone age 12 and older. Bivalent boosters have not yet been authorized for children under the age of 12. Youths in that age group can get boosted with the previous version of the monovalent Pfizer vaccine.
San Diegans must be fully vaccinated with the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines before receiving a bivalent booster, meaning they must have received the two-dose primary series of Pfizer, Moderna, or the relatively new Novavax. All of those vaccines remain widely available.
Also eligible for the bivalent booster are those who received at least one shot of the Janssen vaccine, which is no longer widely available.
Anyone who wants to get a bivalent booster must wait at least eight weeks after they received a previous COVID-19 vaccine until they are eligible. In addition, anyone who is fully vaccinated and recently tested positive for COVID-19, should wait three months after infection to get a bivalent booster.
Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.68 million or 80.1% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,449,230 or 58.9% of 2,460,402 eligible San Diegans.

1128,County Fire Rating Reaffirmed By Insurance Office,"The Independent Insurance Services Office (ISO), Verisk, has reaffirmed the strong rating of County Fire to respond to structure fires in its service area. County Fire and CAL FIRE now rank in the top 20 percent nationally in its capability to fight structure fires.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-fire-rating-reaffirmed-by-insurance-office/,2022-09-30T10:19:07-07:00,"
The Insurance Services Office (ISO), Verisk, has reaffirmed the strong rating of County Fire to respond to structure fires in its service area.
County Fire and CAL FIRE now rank in the top 20 percent nationally in its capability to fight structure fires.
Verisk assesses the capabilities of fire agencies across the country.  After a comprehensive, months-long process, the company issued County Fire a Public Protection Classification, or rating of 3/3x, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 representing an exemplary fire suppression program and 10 indicating the program does not meet minimum criteria.  Given the high fire danger, the vast service area and lack of accessible water sources, County Fire’s ability to maintain the 3/3x is a tremendous accomplishment.
Insurance companies can use these ratings as a factor for setting premiums, so the better ratings could mean lower insurance rates for some property owners in the County Fire coverage area.
The new ISO evaluation validates the continuous commitment shown by the County and this Board of Supervisors to improve fire and emergency service levels in unincorporated areas,” said Supervisor Jim Desmond, District 5.  “This is great news not only when it comes to safety, but also lowering the insurance rates for taxpayers. I’m proud of all we have accomplished in the past four years, spending more than $6 million dollars on upgrades to fire stations and facilities throughout North County.”
Supervisor Joel Anderson, District 2 says, “This is welcome news for many of my constituents in the back country. The ISO rating is the culmination of more than a decade of work to strengthen emergency resources.  It is an added benefit if our efforts can help residents and businesses in places like Ramona, Campo, and Mt. Laguna get a break on their insurance rates.”
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher recognized the tremendous amount of work that went into achieving the rating. “Since the devastating 2003 Cedar Fire, our County has invested more than $600 million. Those investments have improved fire protection and emergency medical services, added staffing, fire stations, made communication enhancements, increased training and brush management. We’ve also added more ground and air equipment.”
County Fire’s service area covers more than 1,500 square miles of San Diego County.  Property owners are encouraged to contact their insurance companies to find out how the classification may affect their policy.
County Fire reorganized fire services in the unincorporated areas in 2008, bringing nearly 20 largely volunteer run departments under a unified command.  Professional firefighters and emergency personnel now respond to fires, medical calls and disasters across the County with upgraded fire apparatus and Advanced Life Support Paramedic engines.
Verisk works across the country with insurance companies, communities, fire departments, insurance regulators, and others to assess risk.  The research measures municipal fire suppression efforts, emergency communications capabilities, firefighting training levels, apparatus and equipment, and staffing, as well as community water supply.
County Fire’s response ensured the ISO considered the water systems and service levels in the communities of Campo, Lake Morena, Jacumba, Yuima and Julian, allowing over 3,800 properties to improve to a level 3 classification.

1129,Mouse Tests Positive for Hantavirus in Guatay,"A deer mouse collected in routine monitoring from an open area in Guatay near Pine Valley has tested positive for the potentially deadly hantavirus. Remember, never sweep up or vacuum up after wild rodents if you find them in living spaces; use wet-cleaning methods instead.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209649,2022-09-30T14:22:48-07:00,"
A deer mouse collected in routine monitoring from an open area in Guatay near Pine Valley has tested positive for the potentially deadly hantavirus.
County officials are reminding people to never sweep up or vacuum up after wild rodents if they find them in living spaces, including homes, sheds, garages and cabins.
Instead, people should use “wet-cleaning” methods to keep from breathing in the virus and getting sick.
Finding hantavirus in wild rodents is common in San Diego County. However, people rarely come into contact with hantavirus — which has no vaccine or cure — because wild rodents naturally want to avoid people.
People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents invade people’s spaces. Infected rodents shed the virus in their urine, feces and saliva. That matter dries and can be stirred into the air where people can breathe it in.
If people find wild rodents, nests or signs of them in their living spaces and must clean, they should always use “wet cleaning” methods — using bleach or other disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags. They should NOT sweep or vacuum, which could stir hantavirus into the air where it could be inhaled.
Here are tips for people to prevent being exposed to wild rodents and hantavirus, and how to use wet-cleaning methods.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent droppings and urine.
Clean up rodent droppings and urine using the wet cleaning method described below.

Use “Wet-cleaning” Methods to Prevent Inhaling the Virus

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent droppings, nests, contaminated traps, and surrounding areas and let the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

For more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality (DEHQ) at (858) 694-2888 or visit the DEHQ hantavirus web page.

1131,"County, City of San Diego Pass Resolution to Create 10,000 Affordable Homes","During a historic housing summit, the County and City of San Diego approved a resolution to expand the affordable housing supply by 10,000 homes using government land by 2030.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-city-of-san-diego-pass-resolution-to-create-10000-affordable-homes/,2022-10-03T15:29:54-07:00,"
During a historic housing summit, the County and City of San Diego approved a resolution to expand the affordable housing supply by 10,000 homes using government land by 2030.
The formal County/City Council meeting was the first in more than 22 years between the two entities and was held Monday at San Diego State University.
County Board Chair Nathan Fletcher and Council President Sean Elo-Rivera led the summit. Both cited the importance of working together to act on the region’s critical housing shortage.
“We know that housing is foundational to life, it is the most basic thing that you need in order to be able to live a fulfilled and thriving life,” said County Chair Nathan Fletcher. “We also know that in San Diego County, we have some of the least affordable housing anywhere in the country.”
“Stable housing is the foundation of opportunity, and instability w/respect to housing has profound impacts…,” said Council President Sean Elo-Rivera. “We have a responsibility to make housing stable and fulfilling that responsibility will require collaboration.”
The resolution calls for supporting four major actions:

Streamlining permitting to accelerate housing production
Building 10,000 affordable homes on government-owned land near transit lines, that also support climate action goals and offer construction workers good paying jobs
Leveraging public, private and other funds to speed up the availability of affordable housing
Increasing density on properties owned by the San Diego Housing Commission or its nonprofit affiliate

The vote came after presentations from several organizations who also cited the critical need for housing.
The Global Policy Leadership Academy’s Jennifer LeSar told government leaders that San Diego is noted nationally for tackling affordability but there is still more work to do. Figures showed that 81% of earned low-income households in the county are paying more than half their income on housing costs. And that puts a number of households at risk for homelessness. For those already experiencing homelessness, the Point in Time count found 8,427 people. From that total, 4,321 are sheltered but 4,106 are unsheltered.
The San Diego Foundation is developing a GIS mapping tool of open parcels on public land in the cities of San Diego and Chula Vista, the County and excess state lands that could be developed for affordable housing. The parcels are judged on quality of life, the ease of building housing, land use, transit and more.
The foundation’s presentation also included details on its Housing Impact Fund and its $10 million commitment to raise an additional $90 million to address housing needs.
The San Diego Housing Commission has 22,000 units in service but is exploring ways to add more to the 4,120 properties it owns while keeping in mind climate goals, equity, a variety of housing types and income levels plus childcare.
“We have a long way to go but everyone that you see here before you today is really committed to doing this work …  and working through all these challenges to make sure we see real progress,” said Chair Fletcher. “As County government…, we pledge the County government will be more active and more engaged than at any point in history.”
Council President Elo-Rivera said we must make sure the resolution is not just symbolic and called for an accountability check early next year.

1133,It’s Time to ‘Check Your Mood’,How have you been feeling lately? It’s an important question we should all ask each other – and ourselves – from time to time to ensure continued emotional well-being. The County will host its annual Check Your Mood Day Oct. 6 to encourage San Diegans to get screened for depression and assess their mental health.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/its-time-to-check-your-mood-2/,2022-10-04T12:15:37-07:00,"
How have you been feeling lately? It’s an important question we should all ask each other – and ourselves – from time to time to ensure continued emotional well-being.
The County will host its annual Check Your Mood Day on Oct. 6 to encourage San Diegans to get screened for depression and assess their mental health. This year’s event will be held in conjunction with National Depression Screening Day.
As part of Check Your Mood Day, the County will provide a variety of in-person and online activities, self-care tips, and resources. Community members who are unable to attend an in-person Check Your Mood Day event are encouraged to take an online self-assessment and participate in a social media campaign, with actionable steps and tips to stay mentally healthy.
“Getting screened for behavioral health conditions is just as important as getting your blood pressure checked or seeing your medical provider for an annual physical,” said Luke Bergmann, Ph.D., director of the County’s Behavioral Health Services. “Mental health screenings are a quick and easy tool that can indicate the first signs of what could become a serious mental illness, and I encourage every San Diegan to take advantage of Check Your Mood Day.”
According to Mental Health America, nearly one in five American adults suffers from a mental illness. Despite how common depression is, many Americans don’t realize they’re experiencing the condition, or they suffer in silence out of fear of being stigmatized.
Symptoms of depression vary but include lack of energy, sadness, loss of interest in activities that previously brought joy, and trouble falling asleep or staying asleep. Many signs of clinical depression are overlooked or dismissed as something that will simply pass with time.
Self-care Tips

Safely connect with family and friends
Get outside for walks and hikes
Meditate
Stay physically active
Eat healthy, nutritious meals
Listen to music and dance

Check Your Mood Day is part of the County’s Live Well San Diego health initiative. Visit the Check Your Mood Day page for details and more mental health tips and resources.
In addition to the virtual Check Your Mood event, the County’s multilingual Access and Crisis Line is available seven days a week, 24 hours a day at (888) 724-7240. Calls are answered by experienced counselors, with assistance available in over 200 languages.

1134,New Number One Crop in County’s Annual Crop Report,"San Diego County has a new number-one crop for the first time in 12 years, other crops racked up double-digit value increases, and agriculture remained a key industry at $1.75 billion in value in the County’s new Crop Report. However, the report also showed total crop and commodity values fell for the first time since 2018, by nearly 3.2% from $1.8 billion a year ago.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-number-one-crop-in-countys-annual-crop-report/,2022-10-05T08:54:30-07:00,"
San Diego County has a new number-one crop for the first time in 12 years, other crops racked up double-digit value increases, and agriculture remained a key industry at $1.75 billion in value in the County’s new Crop Report.
However, the report, which covers the 2021 growing season, also showed total crop and commodity values fell for the first time from the previous year since 2018, by nearly 3.2% from $1.8 billion. And it reported a historic decrease in value for one of San Diego’s most famous crops, avocados, which fell below $100 million in value for the first time in Crop Reports dating back 25 years to 1996.
One of the big stories in the new report was the coronation of a new number-one crop in the county. For the past 12 years, “Ornamental Trees and Shrubs” had been number one. But it was supplanted this year by “Bedding Plants, Color & Perennials, Cacti & Succulents,” which ranked second in the previous two crop reports.
Ornamental Trees and Shrubs dropped by 11.5% in the new report, from $432,039,762 to $382,387,500. Meanwhile, Bedding Plants, Color & Perennials, Cacti & Succulents increased 13.1% in value to $488,376,727 — the highest value ever for a top crop in San Diego County.
The commodity that earned the biggest increase in value in the new report was Livestock and Poultry products, which jumped by 36%, from roughly $41 million to nearly $55.4 million.
Avocados, one of the county’s best-known crops, shrank by 46%, from roughly $153 million to $82.8 million, driven by hot, dry weather according to the report. In addition to dipping below $100 million for the first time, avocados also dropped out of top four of the Top 10 crops for the first time since 2003.
This year’s report stated that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic caused values of some crops to increase and others to decrease in value during the growing season. Some growers reported labor shortages and business closures, in addition to increased labor costs, increasingly high costs of water and the extended drought. Other growers reported increased sales for certain crops due to the pandemic.
The County’s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures (AWM) compiles the Crop Report every year and posts it online. The report provides a yearly look of an industry that remains a staple of the region’s economy despite new challenges like the COVID pandemic, and longstanding ones like the region’s continuing drought, rising water costs, fires, freezes and pests.
AWM supports the agriculture industry in numerous ways, from inspecting and intercepting invasive agricultural pests like the Mexican and Mediterranean fruit flies, light brown apple moths and Asian citrus psyllids. It also, among other actions, regulates pesticide use, verifies organic produce, inspects farmer’s markets and conducts safety training for agricultural fieldworkers.
The County’s Board of Supervisors have taken several actions to boost agriculture. Some of those include creating the PACE program that preserves agricultural space through easements; creating a boutique winery ordinance to promote the creation of small wineries; approving a beekeeping ordinance that allows more beekeeping while protecting the public; and streamlining agriculture-related regulations.
This summer, County supervisors unanimously approved an Ag Pass program that will allow farmers and ranchers access to their farms and ranches during disasters like wildfires when it is considered safe, to care for their animals or crops.
Supervisor Jim Desmond, who brought the Ag Pass proposal to the Board along with Supervisor Joel Anderson, represents the County’s Fifth supervisorial district that is home to a lot of the County’s agricultural land.
“Agriculture is more than important to our county, it’s an essential part of our character and needs to be supported and cultivated,” Desmond said. “I’m honored to be supervisor of District Five, which is the largest district and makes up 70% of agriculture produced in the entire County.”
Other notable information from the report includes:

“Honey & Beeswax” suffered the biggest percentage decrease in value, falling 85%, from $516,890 in 2020 to $79,023 in 2021.
“Vegetables, Other” supplanted avocados as the number four crop in the Top 10 with $104.5 million value.
Total Fruit and Nut crops decreased by 31.2%, its biggest decrease since 2015.
“Indoor Flowering & Foliage plants,” ranked third in the Top 10, increased by 15.8%, from $307,662,324 in 2020 to $356,408,291 in the 2021 report.

1135,Get Vaccinated Ahead of Holiday Gatherings,"With the holidays right around the corner, San Diegans are reminded to schedule their COVID-19 booster and flu vaccines as soon as possible to prevent the spread of illness during upcoming seasonal gatherings.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/get-vaccinated-ahead-of-holiday-gatherings/,2022-10-06T18:34:12-07:00,"
With the holidays right around the corner, San Diegans are reminded to schedule their COVID-19 booster and flu vaccines as soon as possible to prevent the spread of illness during upcoming seasonal gatherings.
It is safe to get both the COVID-19 vaccine and flu shot during the same visit and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone 6 months or older get vaccinated against both viruses. COVID-19 primary series vaccines and bivalent boosters, as well as flu shots are widely available across the region.
“Vaccines are safe and effective at preventing severe outcomes from disease, but it takes some time for them to take full effect after vaccination,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “It takes most people about two weeks to develop antibodies after vaccination, so I recommend scheduling your vaccination appointments as soon as possible to develop protection ahead of the holidays.”
Booster Eligibility
The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna bivalent COVID boosters are readily available in the region. The Pfizer bivalent booster is available for anyone age 12 and older. The Moderna bivalent booster is available for anyone age 18 and older.
Bivalent boosters have not yet been authorized for children under the age of 12. Youths in that age group can get boosted with the previous version of the monovalent Pfizer vaccine.
San Diegans must be fully vaccinated with the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines before receiving a bivalent booster, meaning they must have received the two-dose primary series of Pfizer, Moderna, or the relatively new Novavax. All of those vaccines remain widely available.
Also eligible for the bivalent booster are those who received at least one shot of the Janssen vaccine, which is no longer widely available.
Anyone who wants to get a bivalent booster must wait at least eight weeks after they received a previous COVID-19 vaccine until they are eligible. In addition, anyone who is fully vaccinated or up-to-date and recently tested positive for COVID-19, should wait three months after infection to get a bivalent booster.
Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.3% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,467,090 or 59.6% of 2,462,965 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Seven additional deaths were reported since the last report on Sept. 29, 2022. The region’s total is 5,498.
Of the seven additional deaths, four were women and three were men. They died between Aug. 31, 2022 and Sept. 25, 2022.
Two of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s, two were in their 60s, and one was in their 50s.
Five were fully vaccinated and two were unvaccinated.
Five had underlying medical conditions and two had medical conditions pending.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

2,284 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Sept. 27 to Oct. 3, 2022). The region’s total is now 924,478.
The 2,284 cases reported in the past week were slightly lower compared to the 2,402 infections identified the previous week (Sept. 20 to Sept. 26, 2022).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 11.90 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 6.98 for fully vaccinated people and 23.85 for San Diegans who are not fully vaccinated.
5,524 tests were reported to the County on Oct. 1, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4.3% (Data through Oct. 1).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Oct. 1, is 4.2%.

1139,"Community, County Leaders Preview New Immigrant and Refugee Welcome Center",County and community leaders gathered today to tour a new Welcome Center in National City that will serve San Diego’s immigrants and refugees. ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=209730,2022-10-10T17:24:30-07:00,"
County and community leaders gathered today to tour a new Welcome Center in National City that will serve San Diego’s immigrants and refugees.  The center, scheduled to open by the end of the year, will open just over a year after the Board of Supervisors approved the establishment of a new office dedicated to providing critical support to immigrants and refugees.
“As an immigrant, the creation of this first-of-its-kind Welcome Center is particularly important to me,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “This center will serve as a hub where refugees and immigrants can receive services and resources they need to more easily incorporate into our community. As the safety net of our region, it is critical that we meet our communities where they’re at, including our refugee and immigrant community, and this center does just that.”
The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) is part of the County’s Health and Human Services Agency’s (HHSA) Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities department and was established in June 2021.
“San Diego has a strong history of welcoming immigrants and people from diverse backgrounds,” said Nick Macchione, HHSA Director. “We are looking forward to the opening of this new Welcome Center and the services it will provide.”
The Welcome Center will connect individuals – from refugees to asylum seekers to longtime residents of the county-with a wide variety of resources and services all accessible in one building. These services include employment assistance, housing support, interpretation, referrals to legal services and health screenings.
OIRA held two listening sessions to hear from service providers, community-based organizations, and members of the public to learn what they wanted to see in the Welcome Center, including which specific providers should offer services and resources.
“We are already receiving some valuable feedback from our community about their needs. This space is for them. Our goal is to be open-armed and provide much-needed support as they settle into their lives here in San Diego County,” said Lucero Chavez Basilio, OIRA Director. “When we work together with the community and our partners, we can alleviate some of the stress individuals and families face.”
Currently, San Ysidro Health, Alliance for African Assistance, Jewish Family Service, SBCS and the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition are working collaboratively with OIRA and the list continues to grow.
Listening sessions are expected to continue with another meeting in the works for the end of the year.
The Welcome Center will be located at 401 Mile of Cars Way in National City inside the South Region Live Well Center.

1140,County Investigating Suspected Respiratory Outbreak at Patrick Henry High School,"San Diego County Public Health Services is investigating a large, suspected outbreak of respiratory and flu-like symptoms reported among students at Patrick Henry High School.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-investigating-suspected-respiratory-outbreak-at-patrick-henry-high-school/,2022-10-12T12:25:16-07:00,"
San Diego County Public Health Services is investigating a large, suspected outbreak of respiratory and flu-like symptoms reported among students at Patrick Henry High School.
Although the County reports daily several hundred COVID-19 cases, and is already seeing a rapid and early start to flu season, it is too early to determine the cause of the suspected outbreak at Patrick Henry High School as test results are pending.
So far, no hospitalizations have been linked to the illness investigation at Patrick Henry High School. Local hospitals, including Rady Children’s Hospital, have noted a recent increase in emergency room visits due to flu and respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, which is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. The County is evaluating the possibility of other schools reporting similar outbreaks.
“We are coordinating with local school districts and are checking with other school campuses to try and figure out why so many students have been affected so suddenly,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Unfortunately, we anticipated this would be a rough influenza season, and alongside COVID-19 other respiratory viruses are also making a rapid comeback. If you haven’t already, now is the time to get your flu and COVID-19 shots to gain the extra protections afforded by the vaccines.”
A total of 304 lab-confirmed influenza cases were reported last week, bringing the total for the season that started on July 3 to 1,082. At the same time last year, the County had reported only 200 influenza cases.
Get Vaccinated
The flu shot, as well as COVID-19 primary dose vaccines and bivalent boosters are widely available across the region. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get vaccinated against both viruses every year.
Vaccination is especially important for people at higher risk of developing complications from the flu and COVID-19. They include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes, and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control
Pregnant women
People aged 65 years and older
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk

It takes about two weeks after vaccination for immunity to develop. The CDC also indicates you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including a booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
In addition to getting vaccinated, people should also do the following to avoid getting sick:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

The final data for the 2021-2022 flu season is still pending and will be available later this year. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths. During the 2019-2020 flu season, more than 20,700 flu cases were reported and 108 San Diegans died from influenza.

1141,Tuberculosis Case Reported at Learn4Life Workforce Innovation High School,"A person at Learn4Life Workforce Innovation High School in Lemon Grove was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed students and staff, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-case-reported-at-learn4life-workforce-innovation-high-school/,2022-10-12T14:49:05-07:00,"
A person at Learn4Life Workforce Innovation High School in Lemon Grove was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis (TB) and may have exposed students and staff, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
HHSA is working in close collaboration with officials at the school in Lemon Grove to notify people who were potentially exposed. The potential exposure period at San Diego Workforce Innovation High School was from Feb. 15, 2022 to Aug. 15, 2022.
A limited number of people at the school have been identified as having had an increased risk of exposure. These individuals have already been notified about their increased risk and referred to testing.
At this time HHSA and San Diego Workforce Innovation High School do not have reason to believe that anyone who has not already been identified as a close contact of the infected individual was at high risk for infection.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.”
TB is transmitted from person to person through indoor air during prolonged contact with an infectious person. Most people who are exposed to TB do not become infected.
People who are infected, and people at high risk of becoming ill quickly after an infection, such as those with an immunocompromising condition, should discuss treatments with a medical provider, as antibiotics can prevent people with TB infection from becoming sick.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call:

1142,County Top Executive Helen Robbins-Meyer Announces Retirement,"After 25 years of dedicated leadership at the County of San Diego, Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer announced Wednesday she will retire and welcome a new generation to guide the County into the future.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-top-executive-helen-robbins-meyer-announces-retirement/,2022-10-12T16:27:58-07:00,"
After 25 years of dedicated leadership at the County of San Diego, Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer announced Wednesday she will retire and welcome a new generation to guide the County into the future.
The exact date of her departure was left open to allow the County time to conduct a search for her successor and ensure a smooth transition. The process is expected to run into 2023.
Robbins-Meyer began at the County as a deputy chief administrative officer following a career in private industry. She rose to assistant CAO, then took over the top executive position in 2012. She informed the Board of Supervisors during the closed session after their Wednesday meeting of her intention to end her time at the County.
“The people of San Diego County are incredibly fortunate to have had Helen’s talents, energy and devotion to improving their lives all these years,” said Board Chair Nathan Fletcher. “She leaves not just an impressive list of accomplishments but a foundation for us to move toward greater achievements. My colleagues and I, and all San Diegans, owe her our gratitude.”
Robbins-Meyer oversees an annual budget of over $7 billion, more than 40 departments that provide a diverse variety of services, and a workforce of 18,000 employees.
“Helen has embraced big ideas and pushed ahead, all while never losing sight of the individual lives of the people we serve,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas. “She has worked tirelessly to create a government that works for all, and she hands a brilliant torch to the next generation of leaders.”
With a complete changeover of board membership firmly in place, community partnerships and staff levels strengthened, and the County in sound fiscal shape, Robbins-Meyer felt the time was right to let a new CAO move the County forward.
“It’s been an honor and a privilege to serve the San Diego region,” Robbins-Meyer said. “With the vision of our Board, the support of our wonderfully dedicated employees, and our work with the community, we have truly made a difference in the lives of our residents, visitors, refugees and migrant guests.”
Among the achievements of Robbins-Meyer’s tenure:

The creation of eight new libraries, 33 parks and 55 miles of trails in her time as CAO. During her leadership career at the County, a total of 33 libraries opened.
Assisting more than 1 million residents annually with access to Cal Fresh, CalWORKS, Medi-Cal and other safety net programs.
Overseeing large new investments in behavioral health, including deployment of Mobile Crisis Response Teams and Homeless Assistance Resource Teams, the addition of crisis stabilization units, and medically assisted drug treatment options.
Leading response during the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuring continuity of County services.
Increasing the number of affordable housing units, including over 4,000 added through creation of the Innovative Housing Trust Fund Program and its public/private partnerships.
The transformation of the foster care system to strengthen and restore families, resulting in a large decrease in the number of foster children.
A culture shift around juvenile justice from punitive incarceration to a model that provides youth life skills and support, including last year’s opening of the Youth Transition Center.
The opening of San Pasqual Academy, giving more than 1,000 youths an on-campus residence with a 90% high school graduation rate.
Reconstruction of the Edgemoor Skilled Nursing Facility, giving a best-in-class medical home to people with severe disabilities. It currently has the capacity to serve nearly 200 residents.
The transformation of a patchwork of volunteer fire departments into a unified, professional firefighting and emergency medical response agency.
Overseeing the County response to wildfires and making sure those impacted have immediate and ongoing support to recover.
Creation of the Waterfront Park around the County Administration Center, turning acres of asphalt into a picturesque focal point for residents and visitors.

In the coming weeks, the Board of Supervisors will develop a process to find the next Chief Administrative Officer.
The chief administrative officer is appointed by the Board of Supervisors to implement policies and direct the County’s daily operations. County services touch the lives of all San Diegans, from health and human services, property taxes, elections, disaster preparedness and justice services for the entire region to functions including roads, parks and libraries, planning and animal services for the unincorporated area.

1143,County Public Health Officials Renew Call For Vaccinations Against COVID-19,County public health officials are renewing their call for San Diegans to get vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 as the colder months are upon us. Respiratory illnesses historically increase during fall and winter as many people move activities and gatherings indoors.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-public-health-officials-renew-calls-for-vaccinations-against-covid-19/,2022-10-13T17:00:04-07:00,"
County public health officials are renewing their call for San Diegans to get vaccinated and boosted against COVID-19 as the colder months are upon us. Respiratory illnesses historically increase during fall and winter as many people move activities and gatherings indoors.
Recent local data shows the value of the COVID-19 vaccines, highlighting that those who are vaccinated and boosted are substantially less likely to die of complications from COVID-19.
In the first seven months of this year, from Jan. 1 to July 31, 912 San Diegans died of COVID-19. Of those 912, 498 individuals did not complete the primary series of any of the available COVID-19 vaccines. A total of 42 people had received only a single dose of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and the other 456 individuals had received no vaccine doses of any kind. Individuals considered not vaccinated represented 54 percent of total deaths.
Of the remaining deaths, 281 completed the primary series and 133 also had an additional booster dose. 80 percent of the 3.3 million San Diegans six months of age or older have completed the primary series. Two shots of these vaccines are needed to complete the primary series and be considered fully vaccinated.
For the period between Aug. 14 and Sept. 10 of this year, the most recent period for which complete statistics are available, the death rate for San Diegans who did not complete the primary vaccine series was 0.94 per one million residents. This death rate is five times higher than those who completed the primary series and received a booster (0.18 per one million county residents).
“Vaccination remains the best way to prevent severe outcomes and death from COVID-19,” said Dr. Cameron Kaiser, County deputy public health officer. “We are especially encouraging those eligible to get the new bivalent booster, as it is specifically designed to protect individuals from the virus variants currently circulating in our community. These variants and their relatives are expected to be with us into the holidays.”
In addition to vaccination, there are a number of precautions San Diegans can take to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often;
Staying away from sick people;
Staying home and avoiding contact with others when sick;
Wearing a well-fitting face covering when around others, especially in crowded indoor settings; and
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.

Bivalent Boosters Coming For Children 5 And Older
The California Department of Public Health has updated its emergency use authorization of the updated COVID-19 boosters in California to include younger children. Eligibility for the Moderna bivalent booster now extends to individuals 6 years of age and older and eligibility for the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster now extends to individuals 5 years of age and older.
Boosters will be available through healthcare providers and at participating pharmacies. Parents should visit the state’s My Turn website to schedule an appointment.
County of San Diego Public Health Services expects to receive the boosters for children in the coming days and anticipates being able to start administering them as soon as Saturday at select locations. Booster dose availability will be listed on the County’s COVID-19 website.
The updated boosters were designed to protect individuals from the worst outcomes of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death. Everyone 5 years of age and older who has had their primary series vaccinations is eligible to get the updated booster two months following any COVID vaccine or booster dose.
Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,473,096 or 59.8% of 2,465,357 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Nine additional deaths were reported since the last report on Oct. 6, 2022. The region’s total is 5,507.
Of the nine additional deaths, four were women and five were men. They died between Sept. 25, 2022 and Oct. 2, 2022.
Five of the people who died were 80 years or older, three were in their 70s and one was in their 60s.
Six were fully vaccinated and three were unvaccinated.
Eight had underlying medical conditions and one had medical conditions pending.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

1,855 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Oct. 4 to Oct. 10, 2022). The region’s total is now 926,364.
The 1,855 cases reported in the past week were slightly lower compared to the 2,284 infections identified the previous week (Sept. 27 to Oct. 3, 2022).
San Diego County’s case rate per 100,000 residents 12 years of age and older is 11.01 for people fully vaccinated and boosted, 6.08 for fully vaccinated people and 22.65 for San Diegans who are not fully vaccinated.
5,003 tests were reported to the County on Oct. 8, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4.1% (Data through Oct. 8).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Oct. 8, is 4.2%.

More Information:
Data updates to the County’s coronavirus-sd.com website will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays.

1144,"VIDEO: Community, County Leaders Preview New Immigrant and Refugee Welcome Center",County and community leaders gathered today to tour a new Welcome Center in National City that will serve San Diego’s immigrants and refugees. ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/community-county-leaders-preview-new-immigrant-and-refugee-welcome-center/,2022-10-14T15:14:33-07:00,"
County and community leaders gathered today to tour a new Welcome Center in National City that will serve San Diego’s immigrants and refugees.  The center, scheduled to open by the end of the year, will open just over a year after the Board of Supervisors approved the establishment of a new office dedicated to providing critical support to immigrants and refugees.
“As an immigrant, the creation of this first-of-its-kind Welcome Center is particularly important to me,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “This center will serve as a hub where refugees and immigrants can receive services and resources they need to more easily incorporate into our community. As the safety net of our region, it is critical that we meet our communities where they’re at, including our refugee and immigrant community, and this center does just that.”
The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs (OIRA) is part of the County’s Health and Human Services Agency’s (HHSA) Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities department and was established in June 2021.
“San Diego has a strong history of welcoming immigrants and people from diverse backgrounds,” said Nick Macchione, HHSA Director. “We are looking forward to the opening of this new Welcome Center and the services it will provide.”
The Welcome Center will connect individuals – from refugees to asylum seekers to longtime residents of the county-with a wide variety of resources and services all accessible in one building. These services include employment assistance, housing support, interpretation, referrals to legal services and health screenings.
OIRA held two listening sessions to hear from service providers, community-based organizations, and members of the public to learn what they wanted to see in the Welcome Center, including which specific providers should offer services and resources.
“We are already receiving some valuable feedback from our community about their needs. This space is for them. Our goal is to be open-armed and provide much-needed support as they settle into their lives here in San Diego County,” said Lucero Chavez Basilio, OIRA Director. “When we work together with the community and our partners, we can alleviate some of the stress individuals and families face.”
Currently, San Ysidro Health, Alliance for African Assistance, Jewish Family Service, SBCS and the Bilateral Safety Corridor Coalition are working collaboratively with OIRA and the list continues to grow.
Listening sessions are expected to continue with another meeting in the works for the end of the year.
The Welcome Center will be located at 401 Mile of Cars Way in National City inside the South Region Live Well Center.

1147,Do the Drill for Earthquake Safety and Survival,"San Diego County residents and businesses still have time to register to join the Great California ShakeOut earthquake drill which is being held Thursday, 10/20/22.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/do-the-drill-for-earthquake-safety-and-survival/,2022-10-19T10:41:35-07:00,"
San Diego County residents and businesses still have time to register to join the Great California ShakeOut earthquake drill which is being held Thursday, 10/20/22.
Minimizing or preventing injuries during a significant earthquake is the top goal and the best way to do that is to have some safety measures in place before one occurs, to know how to protect yourself during the shaking in different situations, and to be aware of potential hazards after one has passed.
San Diego is in the “before” phase now with more than 800,000 individuals, businesses and organizations in San Diego County currently registered to drop, cover and hold on at 10:20 a.m. on Thursday 10/20. Statewide, 9.4 million are participating and on an international scale, even more will drill.
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services and San Diego County Fire and CAL FIRE San Diego encourage all San Diego County residents and area visitors to register for ShakeOut.
“Review and update your emergency plan if needed, and download the county’s SD Emergency App which includes ShakeReadySD, technology which can notify people of intense shaking several seconds before it begins. This can give people time to seek cover,” said Jeff Toney, Director of the San Diego County Office of Emergency Services.  “The key to surviving an earthquake is having a plan and practicing it in different environments. Where you might seek cover at home is not the same as what you might do in your workplace or in your vehicle.”

Get the SDEmergency App now with ShakeReadySD early earthquake warning. 
Tony Mecham, County Fire and CAL FIRE San Diego Unit Chief, notes those with a plan and emergency supplies have a better chance of survival. This is because during a large-scale disaster, first responders may be unable to get to households for basic first aid calls.
Drop, cover and hold on is the protective action recommended by federal, state and local emergency preparedness organizations as the best way to avoid or reduce injury during an earthquake. If indoors, seek cover under a desk or table, or if one is not in the area, sit against an interior wall away from glass and heavy furniture and protect your head. Do not run outside if shaking begins. But if you’re already outdoors, try to find a clear area and sit down and protect your head. Move away from building exteriors, trees, power lines if possible. For more specific situations and video demonstrations, visit the Earthquake Country Alliance.
The ShakeOut drill can be conducted in as little as 90 seconds. After your drill, look around your surroundings at work or at home to see what items might fall or topple over during intense shaking and cause injury, then secure furniture and wall hangings to prevent the hazard.
Drill tips and information resources are available on the ShakeOut website. Free family disaster plan templates are also available on www.ReadySanDiego.org in multiple languages. The templates include a list of important items to assemble in your disaster emergency kit.

1149,Rapid and Early Start to Flu Season Prompts Calls for Increased Caution,"Flu season has arrived and County health officials are encouraging San Diegans to familiarize themselves with the signs and symptoms of influenza, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and to get a flu shot to protect themselves and their family members.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/rapid-and-early-start-to-flu-season-prompts-calls-for-increased-caution/,2022-10-20T12:45:15-07:00,"
Flu season has arrived and County health officials are encouraging San Diegans to familiarize themselves with the signs and symptoms of influenza, as well as other respiratory illnesses, and to get a flu shot to protect themselves and their family members.
To date, more than 1,600 San Diegans have been diagnosed with a lab-confirmed case of influenza. The 1,664 cases reported to the County since July 1 of this year, are more than seven times higher than the 217 cases reported at the same time last year during the 2021-22 flu season. While the County monitors flu activity year-round, flu season is typically October to March or later each year.
Respiratory illnesses historically increase during fall and winter as many people move gatherings indoors, but flu activity typically does not peak until December or January.
This year, the County has already seen several large suspected respiratory outbreaks in October, including a cluster of illnesses at local schools. The high number of flu cases and other respiratory illnesses this early in the season is prompting health officials to urge San Diegans to take precautions.
“We have reason to believe that respiratory illnesses could be extremely disruptive in the region this year for businesses, hospitals, and people’s lives. San Diegans must do their part to prevent the spread of these illnesses,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “I want to remind San Diegans to use precautions we know are effective in protecting against illness, including the flu.”
Wooten added that people should recommit themselves to the following precautions this fall and winter:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

Get Vaccinated
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that everyone 6 months and older get a flu shot every year. It takes about two weeks for immunity to develop after vaccination. The CDC also says you can get a flu and COVID-19 vaccination at the same time, including the new bivalent booster dose. The COVID-19 vaccine does not work against influenza and vice versa.
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest public health center location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
Flu Symptoms
COVID-19 and influenza are both spread from person-to-person, especially indoors and in crowded places. Symptoms for both viruses include fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain, as well as a sore throat and coughing.
Since symptoms for both the flu and COVID are similar, but treatment varies, testing is the best tool to help sick individuals determine a plan of action.
“Get tested for COVID-19 and the flu when you develop respiratory symptoms and stay away from others if you are sick,” Wooten said. “Protect yourself and your loved ones. Seek medical treatment if your symptoms worsen or if you have an underlying condition that puts you at an increased risk of severe outcomes from the flu or COVID.”
High-risk individuals include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control;
Pregnant women;
People aged 65 years and older; and
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk.

During the 2021-2022 flu season, 4,192 flu cases were reported and eight San Diegans died from influenza. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, including two deaths.

The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is introducing a new combined Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report that will provide San Diegans with a detailed snapshot of common respiratory illness activity in the region on a weekly basis.
The new report will be released each Thursday and contains, for now, both flu and COVID-19 activity, including cases, outbreak information and deaths. The report contains graphs and tables that allow the community to compare illness activity this year to activity during prior seasons.
The Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report replaces the separate Influenza Watch and COVID-19 Watch reports the County released previously.
“The new report paints a more comprehensive picture of respiratory illness activity in the region,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “The report is a one-stop-shop for community members and healthcare providers, and we will continue to update it with new features in the future, as necessary.”
San Diegans can sign up for the report here, or access it on the County of San Diego COVID-19 website and Influenza website.
Bivalent Boosters For Children 5 And Older
The California Department of Public Health recently updated its emergency use authorization of the bivalent COVID-19 boosters in California to include younger children. Eligibility for the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent booster now extends to individuals 5 years of age and older and eligibility for the Moderna bivalent booster now extends to individuals 6 years of age and older.
These bivalent boosters are available through healthcare providers, at participating pharmacies, and at County public health centers. Parents should visit the state’s My Turn website to schedule an appointment.
Bivalent boosters were designed to protect individuals from the worst outcomes of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death. Everyone 5 years of age and older who has had their primary vaccination series is eligible to get the updated booster two months following any COVID vaccine or booster dose.
Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,480,105 or 60.0% of 2,467,279 eligible San Diegans.

Four of the people who died were 80 years or older, three were in their 70s and three were in their 50s.
Eight received at least the primary series of the vaccine and two had not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

1,591 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Oct. 11 to Oct. 17, 2022). The region’s total is now 927,970.

1153,Tuberculosis Case Reported in Mira Mesa High School,The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is working in close collaboration with officials at San Diego Unified School District and Mira Mesa High School to notify people who were possibly exposed to tuberculosis (TB).,https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-case-reported-in-mira-mesa-high-school/,2022-10-24T18:30:31-07:00,"
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is working in close collaboration with officials at San Diego Unified School District and Mira Mesa High School to notify people who were possibly exposed to tuberculosis (TB).
The period of potential exposure at Mira Mesa High School is from March 27, 2022, to June 14, 2022.
HHSA is working with San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) officials to notify those who have a higher risk of exposure, and to ensure those people are tested for TB. While students and staff with increased risk for exposure have been identified, other students and staff may also have been exposed.
TB is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person-to-person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. The chances of infection are higher for people with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB.
“Symptoms of active TB most commonly include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.”
It is important for individuals with symptoms of TB and those who are immune-compromised to see their medical provider to rule-out active infection and to discuss treatment.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call the County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.
The number of annual TB cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 201 cases reported in 2021. Through September, 126 cases have been reported year to date in 2022.

1156,County’s New Chief Geriatric Officer to Help Advance Elderhood in Region,"For the first time, a Chief Geriatric Officer will help lead the County’s efforts surrounding the health and wellbeing of San Diego’s growing older adult population. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-new-chief-geriatric-officer-to-help-advance-elderhood-in-region/,2022-10-27T09:56:26-07:00,"
For the first time, a Chief Geriatric Officer will help lead the County’s efforts surrounding the health and wellbeing of San Diego’s growing older adult population.
Lindsey Yourman, MD will fill the role of Chief Geriatric Officer, joining the County’s Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) Medical Care Services department.
This position is one of the first of its kind in the state and nation for a local integrated health and human services system. HHSA Director Nick Macchione said the time was right for its creation in San Diego County.
“In 2010, our region had about a half million residents 60 years of age or older,” said Macchione. “Since then, we have added about a quarter million more and by 2030 the older adult population is expected to surpass 900,000. The growth is even more rapid for the number of San Diegans 85 years of age and older, which will see its population is going to grow 40 percent in the next eight years. The need is here, and we are excited to add Dr. Yourman to the team which already includes a Child Health Officer.”
Dr. Yourman’s 16-year career of health advocacy, improving care systems and studying the needs of older adults is motivated by her close relationship with her grandparents.
A graduate of Harvard College, Dr. Yourman continued her education as a Health Advocacy Fellow at the Medicare Rights Center in New York City and later attended the University of California, San Francisco Medical School.
Dr. Yourman went on to complete her Internal Medicine Residency at Scripps Mercy and Geriatric Fellowship at the University of California, San Diego, where she worked clinically in diverse settings across San Diego County and became interested in studying models of care that best serve older adults.
Since 2015, Dr. Yourman’s work surrounding older adults has included clinical leadership of interprofessional teams to help older adults live independently and studying quality improvement and implementation science to improve health care delivery for older adults. She was the inaugural graduate and now serves as co-director of the West Health-UCSD Geriatrics Quality Improvement Science Fellowship designed to support early-stage geriatricians to pursue careers in quality improvement for older adults.
Dr. Yourman joins the County from UC San Diego, where she worked as a Primary Care Geriatrician, served as the Medical Director of Geriatrics Quality Improvement, and launched their Age-Friendly Health System’s Initiative.
“I see the creation of the County’s Chief Geriatric Officer position as a victory for older adults and for us all as we age in San Diego County,” said Dr. Yourman. “For me, personally, it means the opportunity to apply my life’s passion, the soul and science of Geriatric Medicine, to support the health, dignity and connectedness of all of us we age.  My grandparents inspired me to go into Geriatric Medicine and I wish they were here to celebrate this.”
The Chief Geriatric Officer will work in HHSA’s Medical Care Services department headed by Eric McDonald, MD, MPH, Chief Medical Officer.
“Dr. Yourman brings the County an immense wealth of knowledge, experience and expertise surrounding the unique needs of older adults,” said Dr. McDonald. “We are thrilled to have her join our team and lead the County’s vision to better serve this growing population.”
The addition of a Chief Geriatric Officer is part of County efforts to support the needs and celebrate the contributions of its expanding population of older adults through the Aging Roadmap, which launched in 2019 with direction from the County Board of Supervisors.
The Aging Roadmap is San Diego County’s regional vision and framework for supporting healthy aging for people of all ages and ensuring the needs of older adults are met when it comes to care and support, affordable housing, accessible transportation and opportunity to work and volunteer.
As a significant milestone in these efforts, in August of this year, San Diego became the first county in the nation where every eligible non-military hospital has earned geriatric emergency department (GED) accreditation from the American College of Emergency Physicians.
On the current regional efforts toward the Aging Roadmap, Macchione commented, “from transforming emergency departments and primary care clinics to building out behavioral health’s continuum of care and integrating experts on aging in our day-to-day work, the entire region is on its way to making San Diego County the national model for elderhood.”
The new Chief Geriatric Officer will work closely with County Aging & Independence Services and support all HHSA departments serving older adults. The CGO will advance the County’s Aging Roadmap by helping to improve coordination of health and social services, and working with local physicians to improve the detection, diagnosis and management of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias.
Dr. Lindsey Yourman begins her new position on November 4, 2022.

1157,First Flu Death of Season Reported in San Diego,"A 55-year-old man from the North Central region of the county is the first influenza death reported in San Diego this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/first-flu-death-of-season-reported-in-san-diego-3/,2022-10-27T10:37:17-07:00,"
A 55-year-old man from the North Central region of the county is the first influenza death reported in San Diego this season, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.
The man died on Oct. 15. He had underlying medical conditions and had not been vaccinated against the flu. He tested negative for COVID-19.
New influenza cases also continued to increase last week. The County Health and Human Services Agency is reporting 856 lab-confirmed flu cases for the week ending Oct. 22. That’s an almost 45% increase when compared to the previous week, when 591 new infections were reported.
The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.
For the week ending Oct. 22, 2022, the report shows the following:

Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 6% of all visits (compared with 5% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 856 (compared to 591 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 2,528 (compared to 232 at the same time last season and a 196 prior 5-year average during the same week)

“Every flu death is tragic and our condolences go out to the man’s family and friends,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Unfortunately, we see influenza deaths every fall and winter and I encourage San Diegans to do their part to stop the spread of illnesses and prevent deaths.”
Get Vaccinated
The influenza vaccine is available at doctors’ offices and retail pharmacies and is covered by medical insurance. People with no health care coverage can get vaccinated at one of the County’s six public health centers or a local community clinic. To find the nearest public health center location, visit the County’s Flu Vaccine Locations page or call 2-1-1 San Diego.
“Vaccination is the best defense we have against the flu,” Wooten said. “It is still early in the flu season and we are already seeing cases spike, so we have reason to believe that the flu could be extremely disruptive this year. Protect yourself and your family now and get the flu shot as soon as you can.”
It takes about two weeks after immunization until immunity develops.
In addition to getting vaccinated, Wooten recommends that people, especially those who are at a higher risk of severe outcomes, recommit themselves to the following precautions this fall and winter:

Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

Flu Symptoms
The flu and COVID-19 are both spread from person-to-person, especially indoors and in crowded places. Symptoms for both viruses include fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain, as well as a sore throat and coughing.
Since symptoms for both the flu and COVID are similar, but treatment varies, COVID testing, which is still widely available across the region, is a good first step to help sick individuals determine a plan of action.
It is recommended that San Diegans who develop flu-like symptoms get tested for COVID-19, especially if you have an underlying condition that puts you at an increased risk of severe outcomes from the flu or COVID.
High-risk individuals include:

People with chronic medical conditions like asthma, diabetes and lung disease, even if symptoms are under control;
Pregnant women;
People aged 65 years and older; and
People who live with or care for others who are at higher risk.

During the 2021-2022 flu season, 4,192 flu cases were reported and eight San Diegans died from influenza. During the 2020-2021 flu season, a total of 848 influenza cases were reported in San Diego, and two San Diegans died from the flu.

1159,County Health Department Warns of Triple Threat of Diseases,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is sounding the alarm about a triple threat of illnesses that could have a severe impact on people’s lives and the county’s medical resources this fall and winter.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-health-department-warns-of-triple-threat-of-diseases/,2022-10-28T09:25:48-07:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is sounding the alarm about a triple threat of illnesses that could have a severe impact on people’s lives and the county’s medical resources this fall and winter.
Local health providers are seeing an early spike in flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases, and while COVID-19 cases are currently trending down in the region, a triple whammy of all three viruses circulating at the same time could lead to strains on the already overburdened medical system.
“As we see a sharp increase of flu and RSV cases, I am urging San Diegans to do their part to prevent the spread of illnesses,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “While there’s no vaccine for RSV, ample vaccinations are available for the flu and COVID-19. These vaccines take two weeks to become fully effective, so people should get both shots as soon as possible.”
Wooten also recommends that people, especially those at a higher risk for severe disease, should consider taking extra precautions this fall and winter:

Consider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces;
Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

What is RSV
RSV is a respiratory virus that has been detected in previous cold and flu seasons, but usually doesn’t spike at the same time as flu. RSV can cause significant respiratory problems, especially in young children. Symptoms of RSV include cough, runny nose, and fever. Treatment consists of managing symptoms and, in severe cases, hospitalization.
RSV is currently inundating local pediatric care providers. Rady Children’s Hospital earlier this week notified families that wait times for care in their emergency room are a lot longer than usual.
Vaccines for the flu and COVID-19, including the new bivalent boosters, are widely available through health care providers, pharmacies, clinics and the County.
“COVID-19 and flu vaccines are safe and effective at preventing the most severe disease,” Wooten said. “While the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID and vice versa, it is possible to get both shots during the same visit.”
Vaccination Progress:

More than 2.69 million or 80.5% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,485,987or 60.2% of 2,469,569 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

Deaths:

Seven additional deaths were reported since the last report on Oct. 20, 2022. The region’s total is 5,524.
Of the seven additional deaths, four were women and three were men. They died between Oct. 9, 2022 and Oct. 14, 2022.
Three of the people who died were 80 years or older, one was in their 70s and three were in their 60s.
Five received at least the primary series of the vaccine and two had not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

1,569 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Oct. 18 to Oct. 24, 2022). The region’s total is now 929,549.
The 1,569 cases reported in the past week were slightly lower compared to the 1,591 infections identified the previous week (Oct. 11 to Oct. 17, 2022).
8,023 tests were reported to the County on Oct. 22, and the percentage of new positive cases was 3.2% (Data through Oct. 22).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Oct. 22, is 3.7%.

More Information:
Data updates to the County’s coronavirus-sd.com website will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays.

A deeper working partnership was celebrated today between the County’s Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) and San Diego State University’s College of Health and Human Services (CHHS). Both organizations signed a formal agreement to tackle major health and human service issues impacting the region, including housing insecurity. The new Live Well Center for Innovation and Leadership will also streamline workforce development by offering internships and providing unique, hands-on cross-training opportunities for SDSU students. This will help bridge the gap between academics and real-life experience while building a local, qualified workforce ready to transition into County jobs.
This partnership is the first of its kind in California and builds on a history of successful collaborations between the university and HHSA. In the last few years alone, HHSA and SDSU worked together as part of a nationwide effort to address COVID-19 vaccine awareness and increase testing availability in underserved communities. SDSU’s public health experts also worked closely with HHSA to design a contact tracing program that focused on high-risk populations. Earlier on in the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 200 SDSU nursing students, in coordination with the HHSA, volunteered to administer COVID-19 vaccines.

County airport staff, working with Carlsbad police and firefighters, are scheduled to hold a major disaster exercise Thursday morning at McClellan Palomar Airport in Carlsbad.
County officials said people living in the surrounding areas should not be startled by the activities, which will run from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m., Thursday, Nov. 3, and could include sirens and fire engines.
The airport is required to hold a disaster exercise every three years. The drill is designed to ensure that airport rescue crews can respond immediately in emergencies with backup from the city of Carlsbad’s fire and police departments, and that the airport fully complies with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards.
McClellan-Palomar airport does not currently have commercial airline service, but has in the past and is required to meet FAA safety requirements.
Thursday’s exercise will simulate a scenario—complete with people made up to look like injured survivors—of a 30-passenger jet aircraft running off the left side of the runway.
Emergency responders will drill to put out fires, rescue, triage and treat survivors, and transport them for hospitalization.
McClellan-Palomar Airport is one of eight airports operated by the San Diego County Department of Public Works.
Members of the media who want to observe the exercise should contact McClellan-Palomar Airport Manager Olivier Brackett at (760) 966-3281.

1163,Violence Survivor Finds Hope and Support at One Safe Place,"San Diego County is home to some of the nation’s most respected organizations providing services to help people escape family or domestic violence. Since July, One Safe Place in San Marcos has been providing hope and services to help victims of domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse, human trafficking, and violent loss.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/violence-survivor-finds-hope-and-support-at-one-safe-place/,2022-10-31T11:39:01-07:00,"
Nani’s smile is lovely and her story uniquely positioned to illustrate the importance of organizations like One Safe Place, a safe haven set up by the District Attorney’s Office to provide hope and services to help victims of domestic violence, child abuse, elder abuse, human trafficking and violent loss in San Diego’s North County.
Nani lived on the streets of Escondido for more than 5 years.  She and her boyfriend were well-known to the deputies and police officers working near the Escondido Transit Center because they were often the subject of complaints.
One day transit cameras caught Nani’s boyfriend striking and knocking her to the ground. San Diego Sheriff Deputies Jason Burk, Brian Abraham and Amber Sprague saw the video and moved in to arrest him.  After the arrest, Deputy Sprague knew One Safe Place could provide the support Nani needed.
“One Safe Place is a one stop shop to support victims of abuse and trauma,” Tracy Prior, Chief Deputy District Attorney and Chief Operating Officer of One Safe Place.
“The District Attorney’s Office created One Safe Place as a one stop shop to address the needs of abuse and trauma victims,” said Tracy Prior, Chief Deputy District Attorney and Chief Operating Officer of One Safe Place.  Care Coordinators from the District Attorney’s Office focus on the needs of victims and their families. They then expand the team to provide an array of services like planning, legal services and mental health support based on the situational needs.
Deputy Brian Abraham says Nani walked through the front door at One Safe Place and “everyone was welcoming.”

The team of professionals at One Safe Place included Care Coordinator Crystal Robbins who quickly went to work accessing Nani’s needs.  
Nani’s mother and daughter lived out-of-state, and they were excited to help her return home. Estefania Gomez, an eligibility worker with the County of San Diego stepped in to help facilitate.  Gomez often helps victims get financial support like food stamps or other aid programs, helps facilitate medical attention for chronic or immediate medical issues, and connect people with a social worker.  But Nani’s case was different. In her case, she had an opportunity to immediately change Nani’s life, pluck her off the streets of Escondido and get her home to her family.
Partner organizations were willing to pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars to get her a plane ticket, but the travel planning had its challenges.
For one, Nani had been homeless for years, so she had no identification or documents like a birth certificate to prove who she was, a critical element in being allowed to board a plane. Staff at One Safe Place set to work to track down Nani’s birth certificate from her home state and work with the state of California to issue her a new identification card.

While this was going on, other team members worked with Nani to get her ready for the trip.  She only had the clothes and belongings she could carry with her, so the One Safe Place department store-style clothing shop was a must stop.
Knowing the flight would not be until the next morning, staff found a safe place for Nani to clean up and sleep while she waited.
“This is a prime example of what can happen when we all work together,” San Diego County Sheriff’s Deputy Amber Sprague.
The following morning, Deputies Burk and Abraham started their day by arriving at Nani’s hotel at 6:30 a.m. and driving her to the airport. They even walked with her to the gate where Nani hugged the deputies multiple times before boarding.
Nani had gone from an abusive relationship, homeless on the streets of Escondido to meeting with her family and a new home hundreds of miles away in less than 24 hours.
The story doesn’t end there. As Nani works to rebuild her life and mend relationships with her daughter and mother, support for Nani continues today. One Safe Place Care Coordinator Crystal Robbins is still actively working with Nani, her family and service providers in her home state.
Nani has also stayed in touch with the deputies.  Two days after her flight, Nani called Deputy Abraham.  She told him she was thankful for the support she received from him and the other deputies and that from the team at One Safe Place.
“In my career in law enforcement, the support Nani got from One Safe Place was one of the most beautiful things I’ve seen, “said Deputy Sprague.
One Safe Place has served more than 1,000 guests since it opened in July.

1164,Tuberculosis Cases Reported at Mission Bay High School and Montgomery High School,The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency is working in close collaboration with officials at San Diego Unified School District and Sweetwater Union School District to notify people who were possibly exposed to tuberculosis under separate circumstances at two different area high schools.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/tuberculosis-cases-reported-at-mission-bay-high-school-and-montgomery-high-school/,2022-11-02T09:39:34-07:00,"
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) is working in close collaboration with officials at San Diego Unified School District (SDUSD) and Sweetwater Union School District (SUHSD) to notify people who were possibly exposed to tuberculosis (TB) under separate circumstances at two different area high schools.
SDUSD, SUHSD, and HHSA have notified individuals who have a higher risk of exposure to TB, and are arranging no-cost TB screening for those who are at increased risk of infection. While students and staff with increased risk for exposure have been identified, other students and staff may also have been exposed. The period of potential exposures are as follows:

April 2, 2022 to Sept. 16, 2022 at Montgomery High School
June 17, 2022 to July 10, 2022 at Mission Bay High School

Tuberculosis is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person to person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. Chances of infection are higher for people with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB.
“Symptoms of active tuberculosis most commonly include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with TB will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.”
Treatments are available that are effective in preventing people infected with tuberculosis from getting sick and in curing people who are sick. It is especially important for individuals with symptoms of TB and those who are immune-compromised to see their medical provider to rule-out an active case and to discuss treatment.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call the San Diego County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.
The number of annual tuberculosis cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 201 cases reported in 2021. Through September, 126 cases have been reported to date in 2022.

1166,"Federal, State and Local Leaders Urge Protection Against Virus Trio","The County, with local and federal partners, hosted a joint press conference today to remind San Diegans they can take charge of protecting themselves and their families against a trio of respiratory illnesses that are circulating in the community this season.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/federal-state-and-local-leaders-urge-protection-against-virus-trio/,2022-11-03T17:28:45-07:00,"
The County, with local and federal partners, hosted a joint press conference today to remind San Diegans they can take charge of protecting themselves and their families against a trio of respiratory illnesses that are circulating in the community this season.
In addition to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the County is seeing an early spike of flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cases. Flu cases rose by 1,198 last week and have now hit 3,735 to date, compared to 265 cases at this time last year.
Flu cases typically do not peak until December at which time RSV begins to increase. While not an officially reportable disease, regional RSV cases reached 1,020 through October, compared with 407 for the same period last year.
The County is applying some of the strategies developed during the COVID-19 pandemic to keep San Diegans safe.
“We know and have witnessed how diseases can have a disproportionate impact, especially in communities of color,” said Vice Chair Nora Vargas, County Board of Supervisors. “Our county has greatly expanded outreach and implemented innovative strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic, and I’m committed to ensuring our communities have equitable access to resources such as vaccinations, treatment, and accurate information to protect their health and safety.”
Responding to these three viruses is not unique to San Diego. Many other areas around the nation are currently also experiencing a spike in flu and RSV cases.
“Here’s the good news. We know everything it takes to keep us safe during the triple threat, and we also have the tools the medicines, the know-how to address that triple threat,” said U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra. “Here’s the challenging news. Will everyone listen?”
Supporting Local Providers
Local public health officials, with strong support from the state and federal government, are fully engaged in supporting the already overburdened medical system to ensure everyone has access to the necessary resources.
“We are fortunate in San Diego County to be able to draw upon the strength of a collaborative network of healthcare providers and long-standing relationships with state and federal leaders who understand our unique region and ensure we have the resources to provide equitable care and support,” said Nick Macchione, director of County Health and Human Services Agency.
County health officials are collaborating with regional medical providers to support their response to the recent influx in illnesses.
“Healthcare providers are experiencing the effects of these viruses right now in regional medical centers and clinics across our bi-national region,” said UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep K. Khosla. “UC San Diego Health was an early leader nationally in COVID response due to its medical expertise and innovative partnerships with researchers, business and community leaders and government agencies. Leveraging the valuable lessons learned from the pandemic, I am confident San Diego will continue to be a model city for public health response through cooperation, transparency and the willingness to share resources.”
Get Vaccinated
Vaccinations are a proven strategy for protecting community health and preparing for a potentially challenging flu season.
“Seeing a large number of flu cases this early in the flu season typically means flu activity is going to be sustained and possibly more severe,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “If more viruses are circulating in the community, healthy people are at a higher risk of getting infected, so this year more than ever, it is critical to get vaccinated.”
Both the flu and COVID vaccine take two weeks to become fully effective, so people should get both shots as soon as possible.

In addition to getting vaccinated, San Diegans can also take a number of other preventative measures to avoid getting sick. These actions include:

Consider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces;
Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

High-Risk Populations
The viruses currently in circulation are hitting seniors and children particularly hard. Flu and RSV patients are currently inundating local pediatric care providers, with wait times at Rady Children’s Hospital exceeding several hours last week.
“RSV is a common virus in children that usually appears during winter months. The difference this year is that we are seeing it earlier and at unprecedented levels, which has impacted emergency department wait times and hospital capacity,” said Patrick Frias, MD, President and CEO of Rady Children’s Hospital-San Diego. “You can make a difference by getting the entire family vaccinated against flu and COVID, staying home when sick, and seeking the right level of care to ensure the sickest patients are able to access medical services in the most appropriate setting.”
County schools are on the front lines of seeing the effect of the viruses effect their students and staff.
“Schools have learned many lessons from the height of the pandemic that can support our collective efforts to care for staff, students and their families,” said San Diego County Superintendent of Schools Dr. Paul Gothold, citing increased collaboration with public health, improved air filtration systems and implementation of health practices to mitigate viruses. “As a parent myself, I want to reassure our community that we have the resources and collective experience to get through this, but it’s going to take everyone doing their part.”
This includes the region’s strong network of federally qualified health clinics like San Ysidro Health.
“As a federally qualified clinic, we are extremely sensitive to the health of the communities we serve and are seeing firsthand the growth in flu and RSV cases,” said Ana Melgoza, Vice President of External Affairs at San Ysidro Health. “Like with COVID-19, we are leaning into serving our communities, delivering both treatments and promoting the prevention measures we know work, including no-cost vaccinations.”
Which Illness is it?
The flu and COVID-19 are both spread from person-to-person, especially indoors and in crowded places. Symptoms for both viruses include fever, headache, and muscle and joint pain, as well as a sore throat and coughing.
RSV is a respiratory virus that has been detected in previous cold and flu seasons. Symptoms of RSV include cough, runny nose and fever. Treatment consists of managing symptoms and, in severe cases, hospitalization.
Since symptoms for both the flu and COVID are similar, but treatment varies, it is recommended that San Diegans who develop flu-like symptoms get tested to determine the best treatment options. This is especially important if you have an underlying condition that puts you at an increased risk of severe outcomes from getting sick with a respiratory illness.
(Full press conference video is available here.)
More Information
The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.

A ribbon cutting ceremony in Carlsbad Thursday celebrated the opening of a new affordable housing development, the first of its kind in the seaside community. Located on Harding Street and Oak Avenue, Windsor Pointe offers 50 affordable homes ranging from studios to three-bedroom apartments. The units are for veterans and their families earning between 25 and 60 percent of the area median income (AMI) and unsheltered individuals living with severe mental illness. Supportive services are available on-site to assist those individuals experiencing mental challenges and crisis.
The project is the result of partnerships between the County, the City of Carlsbad, Affirmed Housing Group and other community organizations. The development will remain affordable in the community of Carlsbad for 55 years.
The County of San Diego is supporting more than a dozen projects that are currently under construction across the region. Combined, the developments will add more than 950 affordable housing units to our local communities.
The Windsor Pointe complex aligns with the County’s Framework for Ending Homelessness, which was approved by the Board last year.
As part of the framework, the County has committed to investing more than $53 million to create supportive housing for persons with a serious mental illness who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness.

1171,When to Expect Statewide General Election Results,"On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/when-to-expect-statewide-general-election-results/,2022-11-07T14:30:28-08:00,"
On election night, we all want to know the results right away, but counting ballots takes time. Here are some reasons why:

Over 1.9 million registered voters.
Every active registered voter received a ballot in the mail.
Mail ballots can be counted if postmarked on or before Election Day and received up to 7 days after.
Those not registered can conditionally register and vote provisionally up until Election Day.

So, what can you expect on election night?
The first set of unofficial election night results comes in shortly after 8 p.m. This will include mail ballots received before Election Day and vote center ballots from early voting between Oct. 29 – Nov. 7.
For the latest results update on election night, you can visit sdvote.com or follow the Registrar’s office on Twitter.
After the first unofficial report, election night updates will include vote center ballots cast on Election Day only. There will be no more updates to mail ballots on election night.
The Election Day ballots come in after the vote centers close at 8 p.m. There will be a gap in time for the next set of results due to poll workers packing up supplies and driving in from the county’s 218 vote centers.
Upon arrival to the Registrar’s office, the vote center ballots will be scanned, and results will be periodically updated until all of the vote center ballots have been counted.
Since there are fewer vote center locations compared to the traditional polling place model, the Registrar’s office expects to provide less frequent result updates.
The final unofficial election night results may not come in until midnight or 1 a.m. and will only cover the ballots that could be counted immediately. The counting of ballots does not end election night. 
What’s left to count?
Mail ballots. The Registrar’s office mailed over 1.9 million ballots for this election and a portion of those were dropped off at vote centers, official ballot drop box locations, or picked up by the U.S. Postal Service on Election Day. Mail ballots sent right before or on Nov. 8 have seven days to arrive if postmarked by Election Day.
Then there are provisional ballots. People who missed the Oct. 24 registration deadline may conditionally register and vote provisionally in person up to and on Election Day.
Once their voter registration is processed and the Registrar’s offices confirms the voter did not vote elsewhere in the state, the voter registration becomes active, and the provisional ballot is counted.
After election night, the next release of unofficial results is scheduled to be posted by 5 p.m. on Thursday, Nov. 10. Additional updates will occur at the discretion of the Registrar of Voters. The Registrar’s office will be closed on Thursday, Nov. 24 and Friday, Nov. 25 in observance of Thanksgiving.
However, the results must be certified by Dec. 8, and the Registrar expects to use the full certification period to make sure the results are accurate. All updates will be posted on sdvote.com with the final certified results posted on Dec. 8.

1173,New County Southeastern Live Well Center to Feature Array of Work from Local Artists,"The County of San Diego’s new Southeastern Live Well Center will open next year, and even before visitors walk inside, they will be greeted by special public art that represents and reflects the dynamism of the Southeastern community.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/new-county-of-san-diego-southeastern-live-well-center-to-feature-array-of-work-from-local-artists/,2022-11-09T11:42:25-08:00,"
The County of San Diego’s new Southeastern Live Well Center will open next year, and even before visitors walk inside, they will be greeted by special public art that represents and reflects the dynamism of the Southeastern community.
Every one of the painters, sculptors, woodworkers and multi-media artists working on the Live Well Center’s art have deep roots in the community. Coming from an array of diverse backgrounds and using various mediums, their work will be featured throughout the 65,000-square-foot space.
The one-stop hub on the corner of Market Street and Euclid Avenue is set to open in the summer of 2023. It will house self-sufficiency and family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans’ services as well as space for community-based organizations and community meetings.
Community feedback has been essential to every step of the project and has been applied to the design and art. The 14 artists chosen to display their work are incorporating the public’s feedback as they work to create final pieces based on their submitted concepts. The artists are working alongside the project’s architects to ensure their pieces are optimized in scale and scope.
Art concept “Gateway” by Manuelita Brown
For example, leading up to the building’s main entrance, will be a large sculpture entitled “Gateway,” by artist Manuelita Brown. According to Brown, it will depict “a human passing through an opening.” Brown said that her art concept illustrates “a narrative of leaving one space for another.” It will include a collection of medallions representing the cultural identities of community residents.
Art concept “Family” by Victor Ochoa
When visitors first step inside, they will be greeted by muralist Victor Ochoa’s “Family”, a piece that features a girl lifted by her father with arms stretched in flight while a mother carries her daughter on her back. “This piece is about family structures and single parent situations,” Ochoa explained.
Art concept by Kaori Fukuyama
As you enter the main lobby and look up, you will see a skylight installation by Kaori Fukuyama. Her concept features custom-cut acrylic panels of various colors that will “build on the sun and create shadow play on the stairwell below,” Fukuyama said. “The serpentine form will run across the length of the skylight to represent Chollas Creek, which nourishes and nurtures the community.”
Art concept by Francisco Eme
Below the skylight, the grand stairwell will be adorned by an installation by Francisco Eme called “Native Motives”.  Combining ancient and contemporary materials and techniques, Eme’s concept uses textiles to represent cultures of the past, present and future in what he called “a living acknowledgment to the community.”
Art concept by Daniel (Maxx Moses) Hopkins
In the 4,000 square-foot Tubman Chavez Conference Center, there will be two original canvas paintings by graffiti artist Daniel (Maxx Moses) Hopkins. According to Hopkins, these pieces capture “the nature of wellness, vulnerability, patience and love within our community.”
 
 
“We are grateful that these artists will help us create a truly welcoming environment and tell a beautiful story about our community through their work,” said Leah Goodwin of Leah Goodwin Creations, the project’s art consultant. “These artists will bring the art statement values to represent and celebrate the history, diversity and cross-cultural experiences of the community to life.”
Art concept “Singing Patterns” by Doris Bittar
One exterior wall is set to feature a two-part mural screen by Doris Bittar honoring the culture of San Diego’s dynamic and historic neighborhoods. Bittar’s concept, titled “Singing Patterns,” metaphorically bridges regions, history and time together using patterns from all over the world.
Art concept by Jean Cornwell Wheat
Another exterior area will be the meditation garden, which will feature tall totem poles by Jean Cornwell Wheat. The concept depicts faces, hands and cultural design paintings representing the seven continents, as well as a design honoring the indigenous people of the region and California.
Art concept by Michelle Guerrero
The concept of family will also be depicted in the family waiting area. A mural by Michelle Guerrero will depict children, flowers and birds, combining the cultural world with a playful, colorful touch.
Art concept by XoQue Art in Motion
Nearby, wall art by XoQue Art in Motion artists will showcase a children’s storybook theme. The piece invites the viewer to recognize the fact that “we all have the ability to turn the page and change our story,” explained the artists, Berenice Badillo, Selina Calvo, Sandra Carmona, Jennifer Clay and Ana Maria Herrera.
Art will be visible throughout the building, including corridors.
Art concept by Chloe Becky
A large painting in mixed media depicting a landscape including trees, flowers and homes as well as portraits, is the premise of the concept from artist Chloe Becky. “This piece will convey the vibrant beauty of the community and how the people who reside in it create and cultivate their unique environment and rich culture,” said Becky.
Art concept by Wendy Maruyama
Woodworking artist Wendy Maruyama conceptualized a large wall installation featuring a black-lacquered mirrored surface. “It centers on self-reflection, contemplation, memory and meditation,” Maruyama explained. “The blackness of the lacquer has depth, looks as if you are looking into another space and is much like looking at water.”
Art concept by JHelen Ramirez
Using a vibrant color-pallet, Artist JHelen Ramirez’s artwork depicts various monumental moments in history. It is “a testament to the power of the people who have directed the energies toward justice, a portrayal of the living global community and the good people are capable of,” detailed Ramirez.
Art concept by Andrea Rushing
 
Another art piece by Andrea Rushing will show people balancing on pillars in the ocean. Rushing said that while separated, they are “all connected by ribbons and the thread of life.”
Art concept by Jose “Bean” Venegas
Jose “Bean” Venegas’ concept is a painting called “Love” and is displayed on a mirrored surface. “My work is an examination of the different languages not only around the world but in this diverse community,” Venegas said. People will be able to see their reflection in the art piece. “The goal is for the art piece to never be the same…with different people looking in the mirror.”

1174,Active Tuberculosis Reported in Chula Vista Elementary School District,"Students and staff in the Chula Vista Elementary School District (CVESD) may have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) while attending Fred H. Rohr Elementary School during summer and fall 2022 sessions, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/active-tuberculosis-reported-in-chula-vista-elementary-school-district/,2022-11-09T15:01:31-08:00,"
Students and staff in the Chula Vista Elementary School District (CVESD) may have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) while attending Fred H. Rohr Elementary School during summer and fall 2022 sessions, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
The Chula Vista Elementary School District was made aware of the exposure to students at Rohr Elementary during the week of November 7.
HHSA Public Health Services and Chula Vista Elementary School District officials have worked in close collaboration to identify and notify those with a higher risk of exposure to tuberculosis and will be providing no-cost testing to individuals at increased risk for infection. The period of potential exposure is from June 27, 2022, to August 26, 2022, at Fred H. Rohr Elementary School.
Tuberculosis is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person to person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. Chances of infection are higher for people with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected. All those notified of a high risk of exposure are encouraged to receive no-cost testing.”
Treatments are available that are effective in preventing people infected with tuberculosis from getting sick and in curing people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for individuals with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune-compromised to see their medical provider to rule-out active tuberculosis, and after excluding active TB, to discuss preventative treatment.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call:

Chula Vista Elementary School District (619)425-9600
County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621

The number of annual TB cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 201 cases reported in 2021 and 192 in 2020. As of the end of September, a total of 126 cases have been reported for this year so far.

1175,"Holiday Shopping has Begun, Be Sure to Check Your Receipts!",You may have noticed. The holiday shopping season has begun! That means it is the perfect time to remind all you Santa Clauses out there—always double-check your receipts so you don’t get accidentally overcharged by faulty cash register price scanners.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/holiday-shopping-has-begun-be-sure-to-check-your-receipts/,2022-11-10T08:42:38-08:00,"
Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain the traditional “start” of holiday shopping, but advertising campaigns have already begun, and retail associations say in-person, in-store shopping is on the rise.
That means it is the perfect time to remind all you Santa Clauses out there—always double-check your receipts so you don’t get accidentally overcharged by faulty cash register price scanners.
It can happen. If you’re not paying attention, you could end up paying more than you should. Every year, to make sure local consumers are being charged accurately, the County department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures inspects more than 1,400 local businesses and 30,000 price-scanning devices, scales that charge for items by weight, and other equipment that set prices.
And even the best businesses have occasional overcharges.
This year, between January and October, just over one out of every six stores, 17.7%, that were inspected had overcharge errors. And the average overcharge was $1.51. An extra buck and a half may not sound alarming, but in the holiday shopping season, even tiny overcharges can add up to make big dents in your wallet or pocketbook.
So, be like Santa! Check your lists (receipts) and check them twice to make sure you have a merry holiday season. Here are some other tips to help you shop smartly and safely:
Protect Against Overcharging:

Always verify receipts and immediately notify store management of any price discrepancies.
Stores are required to display the price of an item, as you are buying it, before the transaction is complete. Watch the display screen as your items are scanned.
Take sales advertisements with you when shopping to verify prices.
Know that stores cannot legally charge more than their lowest advertised, posted or quoted price.

Shop Smart:

Plan ahead. Start watching for store sale fliers, flea markets, garage sales, clearance sales, etc.
Make a list of what you need.
Comparison shop with at least five different sources for the best values.
Don’t buy everything at once. Establish a spending plan and timetable to buy what you need over several weeks or months to take full advantage of future sales and true bargains.
Download and use the County’s Tell Us Now app to contact Agriculture, Weights and Measures, or call AWM at 1-888-TRUE SCAN (1-888-878-3722) or email to sdcawm@sdcounty.ca.gov to report overcharges you can’t resolve with a store.

1176,Local Monkeypox Health Emergency Is Expiring ,"San Diego County’s local health emergency for monkeypox (MPOX) is expiring today, Thursday, Nov. 10.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/local-monkeypox-health-emergency-is-expiring/,2022-11-10T16:11:56-08:00,"
San Diego County’s local health emergency for monkeypox (MPOX) is expiring today, Thursday, Nov. 10.
County Public Health officials are taking this step following a significant decrease in new MPOX cases, with five or fewer new cases per week since mid-October. This decline is a result of successful outbreak response measures including contact tracing and vaccinations.
The County declared the health emergency for MPOX on Aug. 2, 2022, to effectively respond to the virus and stay ahead of its spread, seek available resources, and ensure the most effective distribution of vaccine and treatment.
“We have reached a point in our MPOX response where a local health emergency is no longer necessary, now that ample testing, treatment, and vaccines are available.” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “Although the virus remains in the region and there is still work to be done in stopping its spread, I am very proud of how the community and our healthcare partners collaborated in responding to the outbreak and am confident that will continue into the future.”
While the emergency declaration has ended, the County will continue to provide the JYNNEOS vaccine, which helps protect people from getting MPOX, at vaccination events and County Public Health clinics. First and second dose vaccinations remain available at Public Health Centers. Those being vaccinated now have the option of an intradermal shot into the skin of the forearm, or a more traditional shot into the upper arm. Outreach and education efforts will also continue.
Nearly 13,000 people in San Diego County have received at least one dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine.
Eligible San Diegans who have not received their first or second dose of the JYNNEOS vaccine should do so to ensure maximum protection against the virus.
The County has had a total of 448 MPOX cases since the first case was reported on June 15.
For more information about where to get the vaccine and who is eligible for it, visit the County’s MPOX website.

1177,Get Your COVID and Flu Shots Now to Be Ready for Holiday Gatherings,"With Thanksgiving two weeks away, there is no better time than now to get your COVID-19 bivalent booster and flu shot.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/get-your-covid-and-flu-shots-now-to-be-ready-for-holiday-gatherings/,2022-11-10T17:29:00-08:00,"
Winter viruses are occurring early this year, especially for our kids. With Thanksgiving two weeks away, there is no better time than now to get your COVID-19 bivalent booster and flu shot.
It takes about two weeks after vaccination until the body develops sufficient immunity against both viruses, so this is the ideal time to get the two vaccines before getting together with family during the upcoming holidays.
“Don’t let flu, COVID-19 or respiratory syncytial virus ruin your family reunions this holiday season,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Protect yourself and your family, stay up to date on flu and COVID-19 vaccines and consider masking in crowded indoor spaces until virus activity slows.”
COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region and can be administered during the same visit. It’s important to note that the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID and the COVID vaccine or booster does not protect against the flu. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated for both viruses.
There is no vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) but established disease prevention measures can protect people from getting ill with any of the three respiratory viruses that are currently circulating in the community.
These measures include:

Consider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces.
Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
If you are sick, stay home and avoid contact with others.

Local Vaccination Efforts
COVID-19 booster vaccination rates in San Diego County are right in line with rates in other parts of the state. So far, 328,172 San Diegans have received their bivalent booster.
That’s about 13% of eligible County residents, about the same as rates in other parts of the state
COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

More than 2.68 million or 80.3% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,490,046 or 59.8% of 2,490,511 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

COVID-19 Deaths:

12 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 3, 2022. The region’s total is 5,543.
Of the 12 additional deaths, five were women and seven were men. They died between Sept. 1, 2021 and Oct. 1, 2022. None of the newly reported deaths occurred in the last two weeks.
Six of the people who died were 80 years or older, two were in their 70s, two were in their 60s and two were in their 50s.
Eight received at least the primary series of the vaccine and four had not.
Ten had underlying medical conditions and two did not have any underlying medical conditions.

COVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

2,016 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Nov. 1 to Nov. 7, 2022). The region’s total is now 933,270.
The 2,016 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 1,702 infections identified the previous week (Oct. 25 to Oct. 31, 2022).
5,957 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 5, and the percentage of new positive cases was 4.1% (Data through Nov. 5).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Nov. 5, is 3.8%.

Influenza Activity
The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.
For the week ending Nov. 5, 2022, the report shows the following:

No additional flu deaths, the season’s total remains at 2
Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 9% of all visits (compared with 7% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 1,732 (compared to 1,201 the previous week)
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 5,471 (compared to 291 at the same time last season and a 259 prior 5-year average during the same week)

More Information:
Data updates to the County’s coronavirus-sd.com website will be published Thursdays around 5 p.m., with the exception of holidays. More information about the flu is available on the County’s influenza website.

The 25 teens were selected from a pool of more than 155 nominees after virtual interviews and a review of supplemental materials by a panel from the Public Defender’s Office. The 25 Most Remarkable Teens in San Diego County are set apart from other teen award honorees because students selected to be “Most Remarkable” are not only talented, but are driven to succeed, overcome adversity and are passionate about civic issues or projects.
“San Diego youth are acting as leaders, innovators, activists and trailblazers throughout the county,” said Public Defender Randy Mize. “Demonstrating courage, spirit and tenacity, these 25 teens are leading the way to a successful future with creative, smart solutions both for their lives and our community.”
The Most Remarkable Teen program recognizes San Diego youth ages 13-19 for their contributions and efforts in 25 categories including environmental advocacy, arts and culture, technology, civic involvement, entrepreneurship, courage to overcome adversity and other outstanding accomplishments. However, all students interviewed received a certificate of recognition for the honor of being considered.

Elected officials presented the awards. Among them were San Diego City Council President Sean Elo-Rivera, President Pro Tem Monica Montgomery Steppe, Councilmember Marni von Wilpert, Councilmember Joe LaCava and Councilmember Raul Campillo.

He found that memorizing lines came much easier to him than to other people. Bobby admits he’s quiet but says if he’s given a play, a song and a spotlight, he comes alive. Bobby has played numerous parts in various plays produced by the California Youth Conservatory, Theatre Arts School of San Diego, San Diego Junior Theatre, and his own school, the San Diego School of Creative and Performing Arts. In 2021, Bobby received the school’s award for Outstanding Artist in Musical Theatre.
Jasmine Matthews
Jasmine Matthews, 17, Preuss School senior, won the award for Perseverance. Jasmine was homeless during second and fourth grade, and then again, her entire junior year of high school. Returning to these circumstances was especially challenging mentally. Toward the end of her junior year, Jasmine stayed with a friend so she would have an environment where she could finish her homework without the added stress of wondering where she was going to sleep. She is in school seven hours a day and leaves the house at 6:15 a.m. for Preuss, taking 2 buses and two trolleys from El Cajon, then does it again at the end of the school day. Through all these hardships, Jasmine has excelled academically. She has earned awards in chemistry and algebra and has been inducted into the Rho Kappa National Social Studies Honor Society. Jasmine is also a Girls Varsity basketball team member and is co-president of the Black Student Union. Jasmine plans to attend UCLA with the hope of becoming a screenwriter.
Livia Iacobelli
Livia Iacobelli, 17, is a senior at High Tech High School, North County and she received the award for Community Service. In 10th grade, Livia launched a non-profit called the Student Healthcare Readiness Program (SHRP). The organization serves low-income youth who want a career in medicine. SHRP connects high school students with college mentors, hosts monthly keynote speakers and presents educational workshops. As a volunteer at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology, Livia created a system which was used to breed the Double Reporter Mouse, a mouse that expresses fluorescent proteins for the imaging of NETs to use to model pulmonary thrombosis because of COVID-19. Livia also volunteers with the UCSD Healthcare Call Pool where she helps marginalized patients navigate the maze of the health care system. She serves as “Google translator” and companion to many immigrants seeking care. Livia plans to become a doctor.
Roshan Shah
Roshan Shah, 17, Westview High School senior, won the award for Public Health: Innovation. Roshan volunteered in classrooms for students with special needs. He noticed students with communication needs were not allowed to take their school issued communication devices (tablets, iPads, PCs) with them after high school graduation which meant they were left with no way to communicate online. Communication devices with an app can cost almost $1,000 and many families cannot afford the expense. Roshan created VoicesGo.Org, a website helping families understand the avenues available to fund and secure a device. VoicesGo has helped students obtain devices so they can participate in society, register to vote, gain employment, and interact with family and peers. The problem of leaving a public school district without a communication device affects thousands of students across California. Roshan drafted a bill for the California State Legislature which would cost taxpayers nothing but would enable students with disabilities to procure a device before leaving public school.
Ella Kim
Ella Kim, 15, Francis Parker School junior, won the award for Writing. As a Korean American, Ella is motivated to give voice to those whose silent struggles and difficulties she can understand. Ella believes the simple act of seeing oneself reflected in the world, in any way, is inexplicably powerful, whether through music, writing or other mediums, and it is through both her stories and her actions that Ella wants to bring that vision to those around her. Ella explains that when she was young, she never saw books that explained her culture or her history and later felt like she grew up missing that part of herself. Ella intends to address that deficiency through her Girl Scout Gold Award project by creating an illustrated children’s book focused on the topic of Korean history. Ella also created Parker’s Writer’s Circle, is a member of the school robotics team and a founding member of the National History Society Project, head of publicity on the Parker Community Engagement Board and co-head of writing for the Culture of San Diego Club.
Alurah Chappel
Alurah Chappell,17, San Pasqual Academy senior, received an award for Courage to Overcome: Family Situation. Alurah hopes to attend UCSD – and be the first in her family to graduate from college but the path toward this goal has not been an easy one. Alurah was sent to Polinsky Children’s Center after her freshman year of high school. She has been in the foster care system ever since. Alurah grew up poor and in a bad neighborhood with gunshots firing every night. Family life was tumultuous, her father volatile, her brothers disinterested in school or learning. Alurah says being away from family allows her to understand what she wants from life and gives her the freedom to make her own decisions. On the other hand, being away from her parents means she must handle problems on her own without anyone to “save” her. Alurah has maintained a 4.0 GPA and received 10 awards in academic excellence. She has also played five different sports.
Makena Stumpo
Makena Stumpo, 13, is an 8th grade student at Pacific Beach Middle School. He won an award for Performing Arts: Music. He plays piano and guitar both by ear and by reading music, and he is a soulful vocalist. His music teacher shares that Makena has a special gift. He can listen to a song and then replicate it perfectly on his piano or transpose it into a piece of his own. Makena started performing in public in 2021 and he has performed at a variety of venues. He also enjoys being a busker – a person who performs music in a public place for donations. This summer, with his parents by his side, Makena found a spot downtown, put a sign up that said the proceeds would go to the Prevent Drowning Foundation, and with his electric keyboard played music and sang. He raised $200 through this effort. Makena participates in San Diego Junior Lifeguards and plays football, volleyball, and track and field.
Leslie Pagel
Leslie Pagel, 17, Crawford High School senior, received an award in the category of LGBTQIA+ Activist. Leslie grew up in Tijuana and when she turned 12, she came out as queer. During middle school, Leslie was harassed because of her identity. Verbal harassment and cruelty toward gay students was not only tolerated but openly condoned by school staff. In her freshman year, her family moved to the U.S. and Leslie found a sense of community at Crawford that she had never experienced before. She became president of the Gay Student Alliance (GSA) and spent hours researching LGBTQ history to educate and engage GSA members, and to spread information through crafting presentations, Jeopardy games, a Kahoot about pride flags and other creative events. Leslie’s other passion is art. She won the grand prize in San Diego Public Library’s Pride Card contest with her powerful design of trans pioneering advocate and icon, Marsha P. Johnson. Her portrait of Johnson is printed on library cards distributed citywide.
Reed Ganzer
Reed Ganzer, 16, Poway High School junior, won an award in the Technology: Robotics category. Reed served as outreach lead for two years on his robotics team, First Tech Challenge Cerulean Centaurs, and for two years on the Green Griffins robotics team. Since 2018, he has volunteered at over 80 outreach robotics events. He has mentored five younger First Lego league teams. Concerned about the environment, Reed created the STEM to STEAM initiative in 2018 to repurpose waste from robotics competitions. Robotics competitions often require metal or plastic that are thrown out at the end of the competition season. Reed partnered with local colleges and donated robotics materials destined for the landfill to art programs at San Diego State University and Southwestern College. Reed also mentors young students in computer programming through his after-school job at Code Ninjas in Poway.
Naeem Miller
Naeem Miller, 16, is a junior at San Pasqual High School. He received the award for Environmental Activist. Naeem believes everyone has the right to breathe clean air and drink clean water. He has volunteered with CleanEarth4kids for the past two years. Naeem has worked and spoken at events, activities and meetings in San Diego and other cities to lobby for the passage of AB2771, the California PFAS-Free Cosmetic Act, to ban PFAS from personal care and beauty products, and AB1817, the California Safer Clothes and Textiles Act, to stop the use of all PFAS from clothing and textiles made and sold in California.

1183,Library Cards Become Golden Ticket to Help Reentry,It’s like a ticket to a better life—and it comes in the form of a simple card. A new program designed to help people who have spent time in County detention facilities successfully return to their communities and build brighter futures has issued more than 120 library cards in its first year.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/library-cards-become-golden-ticket-for-reentry/,2022-11-15T09:59:45-08:00,"
It’s like a ticket to a better life—and it comes in the form of a simple card.
A new program designed to help people who have spent time in County detention facilities successfully return to their communities and build brighter futures has issued more than 120 library cards in its first year.
The library card program started in October 2021 as a pilot program for women at the Las Colinas Detention and Reentry Facility. It proved so successful that it has already been expanded to all county detention and reentry facilities.
The San Diego County Sheriff’s Department and County Library teamed up to add library cards to reentry services. The library card program hopes to help people coming home improve their lives by giving them access—not just to books, but to all County Library programs, and to create “lifelong learners.”
For example, they can start the path to earning a free high school diploma through the Library High School. And they can check out “Tech Connect” Chromebook laptops, Wi-Fi hotspots and get a free year of internet service to help with job searches, education and training.
Because they don’t need any other identification to get the library card and the access it brings, the program offers immediate hope, a sense of belonging and community.
County Library officials said the program has been welcomed.
Liz Vagani, manager of Library’s Santee branch, said she talked with a man who received a reentry library card when he came to the library to pick up his “Tech Connect” Chrome laptop.
“He was very thankful,” Vagani said. “We chatted a bit about what the library had to offer. That’s when he told me he knew this would change his life.”
Posters promoting the library card program are placed in County detention facilities. People can complete the application process through their counselors. Library staff issue the card—an ID packaged with a list of services and library branch locations. The packet is stored with the applicant’s belongings and given to them upon release—meaning every one of them can rejoin their communities with a card in hand.

1185,What Does the Danger Zone Have to Do with Thanksgiving Cooking? Take the Quiz!,"There’s a chance that many of us will have more people around our Thanksgiving Day tables this year than we’ve had in a while. And that means it’s time to brush up on how to cook—safely, that is!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/what-does-the-danger-zone-have-to-do-with-thanksgiving-cooking-take-the-quiz/,2022-11-17T08:24:32-08:00,"
There’s a chance that many of us will have more people around our Thanksgiving Day tables this year than we’ve had in a while. And that means it’s time to brush up on how to cook—safely, that is!
Because, you don’t want dangerous bacteria like E. coli, listeria and salmonella turning your beautiful banquet into a smorgasbord of food-borne illness.
The good news? You can keep that from happening just by following some simple rules. Here are the basics. Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Keep meats and veggies separated during food prep. And practice good hygiene.
But to be on the safe side, here’s a safe-Thanksgiving (and holidays) cooking quiz to refresh your safe-cooking skills and help you prepare, from the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality.
It all starts with the thaw! What’s the best way to thaw frozen meat?

Sit it out on the counter. Give it a few hours till the outside is nice and squishy.
Not fast enough! Run it under hot water. Until the outside is you know, squishy.
Put it in a big pot of water until the outside is—wait for it—nice and squishy.
Plan ahead and let meat defrost in the fridge. Meats, poultry and fish should be defrosted in the refrigerator. If you’re cooking a big turkey, you should allow at least 24 hours for every five pounds in weight.

Answer: D. (If you chose any of the other three, you may want to seriously consider just ordering pizza.) Thawing meat in the refrigerator is absolutely the best and safest method. That’s because a refrigerator allows meat to thaw slowly and evenly, rather than leaving portions of defrosted meat to stand at room temperature where bacteria can grow exponentially.
Note: The United States Department of Agriculture says that you can also thaw meats in cold water. But — and this is important — the water must be cold, under 40 degrees, and should be changed every 30 minutes to keep it cold. Thawing in the fridge is easier!
How often should you wash your hands and cutting boards when preparing food?

You don’t have to wash your cutting boards. And wiping your hands off on your shirt or pants is good enough.
Before you start cooking.
After you pet the dog — or the cat. Or pick up the kids.
After you sneeze, blow your nose or have to run to the bathroom.
The answer is B, C and D; but mainly, “OFTEN!”

Answer: Definitely E. You should wash your hands and cutting boards before and after everything in A, B and C, and pretty much as often as you can in the kitchen. Handwashing is always a key part of safe cooking. So break out that soap and do it. Harmful bacteria, from E. coli to salmonella and staphylococcus aureus, as well as viruses, can be removed from people’s hands through proper handwashing.
Here are just a few other things you should wash your hands after doing: coughing, handling money, eating, drinking, smoking, and handling or preparing raw food.
Should you rinse off fruits and vegetables?

Not necessary. The supermarket washes them. Right?
You should rinse fruits and vegetables with cold water to remove lingering dirt that can carry bacteria.
Nah. They look clean to me.
No way! I like my fruits and vegetables natural.

Answer: Yes. B, of course. Rinsing with cold water cleans off dirt and other contaminants. But don’t wash them with detergents or soap, even dishwashing soap. You could end up eating residues from those cleaners if they’re absorbed by fruits and vegetables.
Why should you keep raw meats and meat products separated from fruits and vegetables when cutting them up or preparing them?

Veggies can make your meat taste weird. Just weird.
Keep them together. Juice from meats is called “marinade.”
You know, meats and fruits and vegetables really don’t trust each other. It could end badly.
Because raw meats, meat products and blood can carry bacteria like E. coli and salmonella that can contaminate fruits and vegetables — and make people sick.

Answer: The correct answer is D. Cross-contamination is one of the most common causes of food-borne illness, according to the USDA. That is, the transfer of harmful bacteria from one food, particularly raw meats, poultry and shellfish to other foods. When preparing food, you need to keep raw meats and their juices away from fruits and vegetables and all ready-to-eat foods.
Note: If you can, use separate cutting boards for meats and produce. If you can’t use separate cutting boards, wash yours with hot, soapy water after using them on raw meats and before using them to cut fruits and vegetables. Or use your cutting board to chop vegetables first, then use it to prepare your uncooked meat, then wash it with hot, soapy water.)
What is the Danger Zone? And what does it have to do with Thanksgiving dinner?

It’s that great song from “Top Gun: Maverick”!! (Thank you, Tom Cruise for making this joke relevant again 36 years after the original Top Gun.) “Highway to the DANGER ZONE! Riiiide in—to the DANGER ZONE!”
It’s that distance you have to walk—through kids, over toys, past the pets and without tripping on the rippled carpet—to get your Thanksgiving feast from the kitchen to the table. Without. Dropping. A thing.
It’s the range of temperatures between 41 degrees Fahrenheit and 135 degrees Fahrenheit—the temperatures where bacteria can grow like crazy in foods, doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes.

Answer: C; it’s C. Top Gun is cool. But the real “Danger Zone” is the range of temperature between 41 degrees and 135 degrees Fahrenheit that allows bacteria to breed exponentially—not a good thing. If hot foods cool or cold foods heat up enough to enter that zone, your food can become a bacteria-fest. And you, your family and friends can end up getting sick. So keep hot foods safely heated with chafing dishes, preheated steam tables, warming trays, slow cookers and ovens. Place cold foods in containers on ice, or in the fridge. And refrigerate leftovers as soon as you can, but definitely within two hours.
And finally, we end with an age-old bonus question!
Is the “five-second rule” real? Can you eat something you’ve dropped on the floor if you pick it up in less than five seconds?

Of course it is. Just pick it up quick and blow on it. Nothing can contaminate your food in less than five seconds. My dogs eat everything off the floor and they never get sick!
Trick question. It’s “less than” five—so, four seconds…
No. It is NOT real. You really shouldn’t eat anything you’ve dropped on floor.

Answer: C. Eating food off the floor is OK for the dogs, but NOT people. Truth is, almost any contact is long enough for food to be contaminated by bacteria that can be found on the ground or in your house. According to the USDA and Rutgers University, bacteria can transfer from a surface to food in less than one second!
So there you have it. Now you’re an expert. But if you’re still interested, you can get more information about food safety tips at FoodSafety.gov’s “Food Safety by Types of Food” webpage, or by calling the USDA’s Meat and Poultry hotline at 1-888-674-6854.
Now you’re cooking! Be safe. Cook safe. And have a great Thanksgiving!

1186,San Diegans Are Encouraged to Keep Vaccination Numbers Trending Up,"San Diegans are continuing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu, and the supplies and availability of both vaccines remain plentiful this holiday season.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diegans-are-encouraged-to-keep-vaccination-numbers-trending-up/,2022-11-17T16:29:19-08:00,"
San Diegans are continuing to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the flu, and the supplies and availability of both vaccines remain plentiful this holiday season.
In the last week, 38,753 COVID-19 vaccinations and 63,149 flu shots have been administered.
As of Nov. 17, 2022, close to 2.69 million or 80.3% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines. Boosters have been administered to 1,495,492 or 60% of 2,491,808 eligible San Diegans.
Of those with boosters, the County is now tracking separately COVID-19 bivalent boosters. As of Nov. 17, 2022, 15.1 percent of eligible San Diegans have received a bivalent booster.
As of Nov. 12, 2022, 813,065 San Diegans have received a flu vaccination, which is 24.3 percent of the 3,351,784 eligible. This year’s flu shot uptake is slightly higher when compared to the same time last year when 23 percent of the eligible population had received a flu vaccine.
It takes about two weeks after vaccination until the body develops sufficient immunity against both vaccinations.
“I want to congratulate all of those who have recently been vaccinated against the flu or COVID-19, including those newly boosted, and encourage the community to help us improve on that progress,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Don’t let flu or COVID-19 ruin your family reunions this holiday season. You have the ability to protect yourself, your family, and your community.”
COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region at pharmacies, medical centers and clinics. The two vaccines can be administered during the same visit. It is important to note that the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or booster does not protect against the flu and the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated against both viruses.
There is no vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but established disease prevention measures can protect people from getting ill with any of the multiple respiratory viruses now circulating in the community.
These measures include:

Consider a well-fitting, good-quality mask, especially indoors or in crowded spaces.
Wash hands thoroughly and often;
Use hand sanitizers, if unable to wash hands;
Stay away from sick people;
Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth;
Clean commonly touched surfaces; and
Stay home and avoid contact with others, if you are sick.

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.3% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,495,492 or 60% of 2,491,808 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

COVID-19 Deaths:

14 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 10, 2022. The region’s total is 5,557.
Of the 14 additional deaths, seven were women and seven were men. They died between July 16, 2022 and Nov. 4, 2022. Three of the newly reported deaths occurred in the last two weeks.
Seven of the people who died were 80 years or older, four were in their 70s and three were in their 60s.
12 received at least the primary series of the vaccine and two had not.
13 had underlying medical conditions and one has medical history pending.

COVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

2,298 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Nov. 8 to Nov. 14, 2022). The region’s total is now 935,554.
The 2,298 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 2,016 infections identified the previous week (Nov. 1 to Nov. 7, 2022).
5,153 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 12, and the percentage of new positive cases was 5.3% (Data through Nov. 12).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Nov. 12, is 4.3%.

Influenza Activity
The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.
For the week ending Nov. 12, 2022, the report shows the following:

No additional flu deaths, the season’s total remains at 2
Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 10% of all visits (compared with 9% the previous week)
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 2,361(compared to 1,754 the previous week)

Whatever your plans, don't pack a pest!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/this-holiday-season-dont-pack-a-pest/,2022-11-21T08:23:16-08:00,"
The holiday season means it’s time to ship gifts to faraway friends and family, or maybe even travel to deliver them in person and bring gifts back home in return.
Whatever you do, be sure you don’t ship or bring back a present nobody wants—a harmful pest!
It can happen if you’re not careful. The gifts you send or receive could be carrying hitchhiking pests or plant diseases that could potentially damage the County’s $1.75 billion agricultural industry and our environment.
That homemade wreath you brought home from grandma’s could be carrying spongy moth eggs; that citrus you picked from your backyard to send to a friend could be carrying huanglongbing—a destructive citrus disease. Or that beautiful fruit basket you made from scratch to send to a friend could be hiding mealy bugs.
So remember. Don’t pack a pest!
Every year San Diego County’s Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures inspectors — human and detector dogs — work hard to stop the spread of invasive pests like the emerald ash borer, glassy-winged sharpshooter, and South American palm weevil.
How can you help?
Here are some simple guidelines:
Don’t Pack a Pest

If you’re traveling — whether it’s out of state or out of the country — leave whatever you find on your trip right where you found it. Don’t bring home a keepsake clipping from Aunt Penny’s holiday wreath, or those bulbs you found in Florida, any citrus branches, leaves or stems from anywhere, or avocado leaves from Mexico.
Don’t transport any fresh, raw, uncooked, untreated foodstuffs. Same for seeds, beans, nuts, rice, dried fruit, decorative greenery, untreated wood items, animal products or soil from almost any foreign country.
If you are traveling and think you may have accidentally packed some plant or animal item away, declare those products when you’re asked by an agricultural inspector if you have anything in your luggage.

1190,Tips to Cut Back on Holiday Season Food Waste,"‘Tis the season—for food! But it’s also a time, as our holiday feasts run from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, that it’s easier than ever to waste food. Here are some helpful tips to cut back on food waste, save money and fight climate change!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tips-to-cut-back-on-holiday-season-food-waste/,2022-11-22T09:02:04-08:00,"
‘Tis the season—for food!
But it’s also a time, as our holiday feasts run from Thanksgiving through New Year’s, that it’s easier than ever to waste food―when it’s served up but not eaten, or spoils before we can eat it.
The United States Department of Agriculture and County of San Diego estimate that up to 40% of the total food supply in the United States is wasted every year.
That can be really hard on your wallet. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates the average family of four spends $1,500 a year on food they end up not eating. That also wastes the land, water, energy and things used to produce, transport, prepare and store food.
On top of all of that, food waste also worsens climate change.
That’s because when you toss organic matter―like food waste―into landfills to decompose, it creates methane, a greenhouse gas pollutant. The EPA says methane traps 80 times the heat carbon dioxide does and is responsible for roughly one-third of the warming from greenhouse gases occurring today.
How can you help? Here are some simple steps you can take to stop wasting food, save money and help fight climate change.
Reduce Wasted Food — Shop and Plan Wisely
The easiest way to reduce wasting food, during the holidays or just day to day, is to not cook too much, right? To help, plan ahead, shop smart and serve just enough food to make everyone happy. Of course, that sounds easy. But it can be hard to do. How do you know how much food is enough? SaveTheFood.com has a “Guest-imator” that can help you calculate how much food you need to prepare, based on how many people you’re serving and how much they typically eat, even for Thanksgiving. And yes, it can even calculate having leftovers if you want them.
Freeze or Find Ways to Reuse Leftovers
Of course, even the best planners can end up with leftovers sometimes, especially at a big event like Thanksgiving. But you don’t have to let them go to waste. If you’re having guests, provide to-go containers, or invite your guests to bring their own, so they can take leftovers home with them. Rethink your leftovers and use them as ingredients for new meals. Leftover meat and vegetables can make a great soup or casserole. Or turn mashed potatoes into potato pancakes. And of course, you can freeze leftovers to use in future meals.
Compost What’s Left!
And don’t forget to compost leftovers. If you don’t have your own compost pile or bin, you can place any remaining food scraps and organic waste into your curbside green bin! (Note: If you do have your own compost bin at home, you probably want to avoid composting meats and bones; they can attract unwanted pests.)
Recycling and Cutting Down on Wasting Food Can Keep Your Pipes Clean
Believe it or not, recycling and cutting back on wasting food can even protect your house. That’s because cooking oils and grease can gunk up your plumbing and even cause sewage overflows if you discard them down your sink’s drain. Making sure you’re not over-preparing food can cut down on the amount of cooking oils you’re using. And keeping used oils out of your plumbing by collecting them and recycling them can keep your pipes clean and your house protected. Contrary to popular belief, mixing used oils with soap, or pouring hot water down the drain after discarding oils in the sink, doesn’t prevent fat clogs that can back up your pipes.
There are free drop-off locations for used cooking oils all around the county. Just collect your used cooking oils in a secure container with a lid and label it “used cooking oil.” Don’t mix chemicals or other liquids in with them. To find the nearest drop-off location, visit the County’s Recycling and Household Hazardous Waste database, WasteFreeSD.org, or call 1-877-R-1-EARTH (1-877-713-2784).
To learn more about reducing wasting food, visit the County’s Solid Waste Planning and Recycling website. And have a great Holiday season!

1191,Active Tuberculosis Reported at California State University San Marcos,"Students and staff at California State University San Marcos may have been exposed to tuberculosis during this fall semester 2022 session, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/active-tb-reported-at-california-state-university-san-marcos/,2022-11-23T14:49:08-08:00,"
Students and staff at California State University San Marcos (CSUSM) may have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB) during this Fall Semester 2022 session, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
HHSA Public Health Services and CSUSM officials have worked in close collaboration to identify and notify those with a higher risk of exposure to tuberculosis and will be providing no-cost testing to individuals at increased risk for infection. The period of exposure was from August 30, 2022 to November 8, 2022. 
Tuberculosis is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person to person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air, which are spread when someone sick with TB coughs, speaks, sings, or breathes. people with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB should get tested.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill at some point in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected. All those notified of a high risk of exposure are encouraged to receive no-cost testing.”
Effective treatments are available to treat people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for individuals with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune-compromised to see their medical provider to rule-out active tuberculosis, and to discuss treatment.
People who test positive for TB but who don’t have symptoms of active TB should get a chest x-ray and talk to a medical provider, as they most likely have “latent TB infection” or LTBI. People with a latent TB infection are infected with the TB germs, but the infection is essentially dormant or sleeping. Taking medicines for latent TB infection, or LBTI, can prevent people from getting active TB in the future.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should contact:

County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621

The number of annual TB cases in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 192 cases reported in 2020 and 201 cases 2021.
As of the end of October, a total of 150 cases have been reported this year. An estimated 175,000 people in San Diego County have latent TB infection and are at risk for developing active TB without preventive treatment.

1192,Keep The Flu or COVID-19 from Getting a Seat at the Table,"As San Diegans prepare for Thanksgiving gatherings, COVID-19, the flu and other viruses are going to try and grab seat at the table.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/keep-the-flu-or-covid-19-from-getting-a-seat-at-the-table/,2022-11-23T16:22:28-08:00,"
As San Diegans prepare for Thanksgiving gatherings, COVID-19, the flu and other viruses are going to try and grab seat at the table.
Fortunately, we have ways to protect ourselves and loved ones.
Vaccines are safe and effective against COVID-19 and flu, and the supplies and availability of both remain plentiful.
While it takes about two weeks after vaccination until the body develops sufficient immunity against both vaccinations, there are other steps people can take to lessen their risks.
These include wearing a well-fitting, good-quality mask indoors or in crowded spaces; washing hands thoroughly and often; staying away from sick people; and cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
“This is a wonderful time of year, and we want everyone to celebrate smartly and protect themselves, their family and community,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Don’t let flu, COVID-19, or other winter illnesses spoil your family reunions this holiday season.”
COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region at pharmacies, medical centers and clinics. The two vaccines can be administered during the same visit. It is important to note that the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or booster does not protect against the flu and the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated against both viruses.
COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Boosters administered: 1,500,106 or 60.2 % of 2,492,580 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

COVID-19 Deaths:

Five additional deaths were reported since the last report on Nov. 17, 2022. The region’s total is 5,562.
Of the five additional deaths, two were women and three were men. They died between Nov. 5, 2022 and Nov. 14, 2022. Three of the newly reported deaths occurred in the last two weeks.
Two of the people who died were 80 years or older, one was in their 70s, one was in their 60s and one was in their 50s.
Four received at least the primary series of the vaccine and one had not.
All had underlying medical conditions.

COVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

3,034 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Nov. 14 to Nov. 20, 2022). The region’s total is now 938,321.
The 3,034 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 2,193 infections identified the previous week (Nov. 7 to Nov. 13, 2022).
5,012 tests were reported to the County on Nov. 19, and the percentage of new positive cases was 6.6 (Data through Nov. 19).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Nov. 19, is 5.3%.

Influenza Activity
The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday (it was published a day early this week due to the Thanksgiving holiday) and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.
For the week ending Nov. 19, 2022, the report shows the following:

Three additional flu deaths; the season’s total is now five.
Of the three additional flu deaths, two were women and one was a man. They died between Nov. 8, 2022 and Nov. 14, 2022.
One had received a flu shot this season and two had not.
All had underlying medical conditions and none of the newly-reported deaths were coinfected with COVID-19.
Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 10% of all visits (compared with 10% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 2,353 (compared to 2,387 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 10,231 (compared to 357 at the same time last season and a 381 prior 5-year average during the same week).

The Hospital Association of San Diego and Imperial Counties awarded San Diego County Fire’s Emergency Medical Services Office with a Community Leadership Award.
The award, presented at the association’s 2022 annual meeting, recognizes the EMS office for organizing a regional Health Services Capacity Task Force. The Health Services Capacity Task Force provides leadership to collaboratively address challenges experienced in the entire continuum of care, from first responders to hospital to outpatient and rehabilitation to community care.
Brian Christison, San Diego County Fire EMS Program Coordinator
The award was accepted by San Diego County Fire Director Jeff Collins and Brian Christison, County EMS program coordinator. In accepting the award, Christison recognized the dedication and collaborative spirit displayed by the Task Force members, healthcare providers, and the hospital association during this unprecedented situation.
The award is inscribed with the following: “With appreciation for your leadership to inform policy and support disaster response strategies to collectively preserve the health and safety of our region.”
Created in 1997, the task force ensures a planned, systematic response to prehospital and hospital capacity stresses stemming from influenza. Since then, it has evolved to emphasize “all-hazard” event management using an evidence-based approach with newly available metrics, enhanced data markers, and optimized sector-specific actions. This task force remained deeply engaged throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure all-community access to needed services and care.

While signs of any potential Thanksgiving surge of COVID-19 and the flu won’t show up until next week’s data is released, cases for both illnesses are continuing to trend up. COVID-19 cases will surpass 10,000 for the month of November, far exceeding the 7,482 cases recorded in October.
Flu cases are also continuing to increase, reaching 2,694 last week, up from 2,375 the previous week. For the season to date, San Diego County has recorded 12,946 cases of the flu compared to 424 at this time last year.
San Diegans are urged to get their flu and COVID vaccines before the peak holiday period. It takes two weeks until the body reaches full immunity.
“The time to act is now,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “Get your flu and COVID vaccines as soon as you can and keep yourself and your loved ones safe this holiday season. And remember that masks help reduce spreading both the flu and COVID-19.”
COVID-19 and flu vaccines are widely available across the region at pharmacies, medical centers and clinics. The two vaccines can be administered during the same visit. It is important to note that the COVID-19 primary vaccine series or booster does not protect against the flu and the flu vaccine does not protect people against COVID-19. Therefore, it is recommended that eligible San Diegans get vaccinated against both viruses.
Treatment Options
Symptomatic patients with a positive COVID-19 test result, including pregnant persons and children, should be evaluated to see if they are eligible for treatment with one of the National Institutes of Health recommended treatment options, which currently for those not hospitalized are nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid), molnupiravir (Lagevrio) and remdesivir (Veklury).
Early COVID-19 treatment in multi-generational families, especially families of color, protects vulnerable individuals like older family members and those with underlying medical conditions.
Testing and treatment are available at no cost by calling 1-888-634-1123 to schedule an appointment at an OptumServe site. Appointments can also be made online. Call SesameCare at 1-888-897-1244 to schedule a no-cost telehealth visit, which includes a prescription for treatment. Appointments can also be made online.
COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Bivalent boosters administered: 422,594 or 17% of 2,492,144 eligible San Diegans.

1195,"County Probation, Sheriff’s Deputies Spread Holiday Cheer to Children",The first Saturday in December really is the most wonderful time of the year for kids and local law enforcement officers at this year’s Shop with a Cop event.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-probation-sheriffs-deputies-spread-holiday-cheer-to-children/,2022-12-03T17:04:03-08:00,"
The first Saturday in December really is the most wonderful time of the year for kids and local law enforcement officers at this year’s Shop with a Cop event.
Franklin, 8, is all-smiles and practically vibrating with excitement as he’s handed his shopping bag by Probation Officer Pedro Bernal, his partner for the event. The morning has been an amazing surprise to Franklin.
“My dad took me to my school and then I saw cops and then they said my name. And I told them, ‘I’m not going to jail,’ and they said no they were going to take me to go to SeaWorld and to go get whatever I want for $200,” he recounted breathlessly.
Franklin happily shows off his blue Switch Lite and game to play on it. The game was an early present from Bernal because the cost of the device used up the gift card.
County Probation, the Sheriff’s Department and the District Attorney’s Bureau of Investigation  joined other local law enforcement agencies, SeaWorld, Target and STAR/PAL to sponsor the 28th annual event, providing 300 local children with a happier holiday season and encouraging positive relationships with officers.
The fun morning started at SeaWorld where the children were paired with an officer or deputy. The children and law enforcement were treated to private sea animal shows and breakfast at the theme park. Later, the children and their partner rode in patrol vehicles with lights flashing and sirens blaring for a $200 shopping spree.
Hundreds of the patrol vehicles caravanned to the Sports Arena Target. Children’s voices booming out on speakers wishing people a Merry Christmas.
For Uriah,  it will be a 9th birthday to remember. As he walked into Target with his partner Deputy Ryan Martinez, he was serenaded by a volunteer when told it was the boy’s birthday. And by two rows of greeters dressed as Star Wars characters and Target staff volunteers clapping them into the store. Actually, the greeters are for every child who went in to make them all feel special.
Inside, Uriah bought gifts for all of his family. And something fun for himself.
“I’m looking for LOL dolls, that one,” said Savannah, 8, who was paired with Probation Officer Janet Moore. From there she went on to discuss all the cute accessories that come with the doll.
The Escondido Police were the host agency this year and over 300 uniformed officers from more than 30 different local, state, and federal agencies volunteered to partner with a deserving child, selected from local schools.
“It’s probably one of the highlights of our year — for me it is,” said Sheriff’s Deputy Ruben Gonzales, who is participating for the fifth time. “This is such a great event, to give back to the community and kids. They love it. We get as much joy out of this, probably more, than they do. He didn’t even know that he was coming today. Mom surprised him. She told him last night, you have to get up early and didn’t tell him why.”
Law enforcement agencies raise money for the event by holding sporting events, breakfasts and other fundraising events throughout the year.

1196,Stay Safe While Holiday Shopping,"Criminals don’t take the holidays off. Instead, they often find more opportunities to victimize people, especially those who are distracted or alone.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/stay-safe-while-holiday-shopping/,2022-12-06T13:32:52-08:00,"
Criminals don’t take the holidays off. Instead, they often find more opportunities to victimize people, especially those who are distracted or alone.
With the holiday shopping season underway, the San Diego Sheriff’s Department will be patrolling in busy shopping centers. In Encinitas, Vista and San Marcos this will include the Sheriff SkyWatch, a lookout enclosure lifted by crane two stories above ground to give deputies a better vantage point in shopping center parking lots.
Yet, law enforcement officers can’t be everywhere, so sheriff’s crime prevention specialists remind everyone to stay alert and be cautious. This advice can help keep shoppers safe and may prevent thefts.
More specifically, the Sheriff’s Department also offers the following crime prevention tips for shopping centers this season and throughout the year:

Shop during the day when possible and shop with a friend.
Be aware of your surroundings.
Don’t overload your arms with packages and bags while shopping.
Park in a well‐lit area.
Have your keys out and ready when approaching your car.
Be aware of how you carry your purse or wallet. Don’t make it easy for someone to grab.
When parking, lock your car doors and take valuables with you.
If you absolutely must drop purchases off at your car and continue shopping, consider moving your car to another parking spot in case there are criminal spotters who might have seen you loading up your car with bags. This extra step could make a criminal think you are leaving.

If you see a crime in progress, always call 9-1-1. To report suspicious activity, call the Sheriff’s Department non-emergency line at (858) 565-5200.

But all that gift-giving—from wrapping paper, packages and new items that may never be used—can take a toll on sustainability. So here are some tips to find ways to have happy holiday season while still preserving our environment and natural resources for our children and grandchildren.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tips-to-have-a-happy-and-sustainable-holiday-season/,2022-12-08T08:54:58-08:00,"
Gifts! Giving them, receiving them―they help put the happy in the holiday season.
But all that gift-giving—from wrapping paper, packages and new items that may never be used—can take a toll on sustainability.
What’s sustainability? It’s finding ways to meet our needs today while still preserving our environment and natural resources for our children and grandchildren by using fewer single-use items and consuming less stuff we may never use. And it’s important.
The County of San Diego thinks a lot about sustainability. For example, to address climate change and protect our environment, the County is working on an ambitious plan called the Regional Decarbonization Framework that would move our entire region toward zero-carbon emissions by 2045.
But we’re not just thinking about the big ways to address sustainability. Many County employees think about the little ways they, and all of us, can live in more sustainable ways. With that in mind, here are a few tips from County employees for having a more sustainable holiday season!
Gifts
Give Experiences Instead of Things: One thing you can do to cut down on the accumulation of unnecessary stuff is to give gifts of “experiences” rather than items that will eventually be tossed out. For example, give someone tickets to a show, free lessons in something they’d enjoy, or a gift card to a local restaurant! For a list of experiences, you can go to WasteFreeSD’s “resources” page, do a word search for “experiences” and click on their “Gift Ideas—Experiences Instead of Things” webpage.
Donations: Another thing you can give, or receive, instead of more physical stuff (do you really need another tie or blouse?) is to ask family and friends to donate to an animal rescue or a cause you’re interested in! Many animal organizations allow you to “sponsor” or “adopt” an animal virtually to rescue it and ensure it’s loved and cared for.
Like the Kitchen? Bake a Gift! Everyone loves food at the holidays. And you don’t need to be a world-renowned chef to put a smile on someone’s face. You know, banana bread is really easy to make. Cookies, cakes, quick breads—you got this!
Green Thumbs? If you have any friends or family who like to garden or grow their own herbs, you can re-use portions of the empty cardboard tubes from paper towels to create planting “pots” for seedlings!
Shopping 
Shop Local: Shopping locally, especially at businesses that feature sustainable and handcrafted gifts, can cut back on a lot of the carbon emissions that you’ll emit driving hither and yon to shop, or that are emitted shipping items to the stores you’re visiting.
Shop Online, give Yourself Time: If you do shop online, plan ahead and order early so items can be shipped by ground—truck, trains and ships—rather than having to be rush-shipped by air, which leaves a much larger carbon footprint.
Look for Gifts Without a Lot of Packaging: Items like candles, soaps, coffee mugs, water bottles, cooking utensils, oils and sauces attractive enough to be given with just a homemade bow or come in containers that can be reused again and again.
Give Gift Certificates to Zero Waste stores: There’s a movement in retail to create “zero-waste” stores—retailers that sell mostly in bulk or using compostable packaging, to customers carrying their own reusable containers.
Wrapping
Ditch the Fancy Wrapping Paper: There are a lot of ways you can wrap holiday gifts without getting the fancy paper wrapping. In fact, a lot of fancy paper wrapping can’t be recycled. Here are some alternatives. If you’re into crafts, you can sew your own bags to wrap gifts in, then reuse them every year! Not into sewing? You can use fabric scraps to wrap gifts. And remember to reuse ribbons and bags again in the future.
Another option is to use holiday decorative kitchen towels: Tie them up with a ribbon. They’re reusable and “who doesn’t want a new kitchen towel?
Recycled Wrapping Paper: If you do use wrapping paper, choose wrapping paper that is made from recycled materials and can be recycled again.
Holiday Cards
Go Digital: Instead of buying and sending paper cards, send ecards, or post on social media like Instagram and Facebook to send holiday greetings to friends and family.
Display the Cards You Receive for Year-round Artwork: If you receive paper holiday cards from friends and family, you can display them around your home to keep the holidays and your loved ones in your heart all year around!
 Food and Gatherings
Inviting Friends Over for Food? Plan ahead, shop smart and serve just enough to make everyone happy without wasting food. Of course, figuring out how much food to make can be difficult. However, SaveTheFood.com has a “Guest-imator” that can help you calculate just how much food you need to prepare, based on how many people you’re serving and how much they typically eat, even during holiday feasts.
Invite Your Guests to BOYRFCs (Bring Your Own Reusable Food Container): Yeah, that abbreviation is unlikely to catch on. However, asking guests bring their own reusable “to go” containers is an idea that should catch on. That way if there are leftovers, it’s easy as pie for your guests to bring some home! No waste and no one-time-only food containers.
Remember to Compost: And don’t forget to compost leftovers if you do have them. If you don’t have your own compost pile or bin, you can place any remaining food scraps and organic waste into your curbside green bin! (Note: If you have your own compost bin at home, don’t compost meats and bones; they can attract pests.)
The Tree!
Ornaments: A lot of us are familiar with stringing popcorn and cranberry garlands to hang on the Christmas tree, but there are other alternatives as well. For example, you can cut slices of oranges, let them dry out and hang them from your tree!
Craft Ornaments: You can also make your own craft ornaments from paper, pinecones, seashells and other items.
LED lights: Of course, using LED tree lights instead of the older traditional bulbs not only uses less energy, but they are more environmentally friendly.
Recycle the tree and wreaths: If you’re using a real tree and natural wreaths, remember to recycle them instead of tossing them out where they can end up in landfills to decompose and generate climate-changing methane.
Recycled trees and wreaths can be turned into mulch to improve soils at parks, farms, home gardens and landscapes. Check with your waste hauler to find out if they offer curbside pickup. Or go to the County’s recycling and hazardous waste database, WastefreeSD.org, to find Christmas tree drop-off sites near you. It’s easy.
So, remember, sustainability is a gift for the earth, your children and their children. And have a Happy Sustainable Holiday Season!

1199,Make Shelter Animals Wishes Come True with a Forever Home,"Dear Santa Paws, my biggest wish for the holiday season is for a kind and loving person to be my family.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/make-shelter-animals-wishes-come-true-with-a-forever-home/,2022-12-08T13:43:07-08:00,"
Dear Santa Paws, my biggest wish for the holiday season is for a kind and loving person to be my family.
The San Diego County Department of Animal Services would love to find forever homes for every animal in their care and they are offering a Santa Paws adoption special of $12 per pet in December. All animals will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.
“Make a real difference in the life of an animal by giving one or two a caring home,” said Animal Services Director Kelly Campbell. “You can be an angel to one of our region’s homeless pets.”
On the subject of giving, it is quite possible that you know someone who would love a pet. If after careful thought, you have decided to give an animal as a gift, why not give a gift certificate from a County shelter and let the recipient pick out their lifetime family member? That ensures a good match for both human and animal.
This is Pine, now renamed Goku, whose wish came true this week when he was adopted at the Carlsbad shelter. His new dad is showing him where to sleep and is helping him feel safe and loved.
The first step to finding a new best friend is browsing all the lovable animals from cats to dogs to chickens and pigs available now on the  Adoptions page.  Animal Services staff recommend picking out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person.
Walk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.
Fill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.
If you cannot adopt, consider fostering or volunteering.

1200,Sharp Increase of COVID Cases After Thanksgiving Holiday,The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a spike in new COVID-19 cases.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/sharp-increase-of-covid-cases-after-thanksgiving-holiday/,2022-12-08T17:00:37-08:00,"
The County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency is reporting a spike in new COVID-19 cases. The 5,649 lab-confirmed cases reported this week represent an increase of more than 63 percent when compared to the previous week, when 3,455 new infections were reported.
While flu cases are slightly down compared to last week, wastewater data shows a continued increasing trend. The County is reporting 2,583 new lab-confirmed cases of influenza this week. Last week, 2,721 cases were reported. By this time last year, 539 flu cases had been reported for the entire season up to this point.
“Holiday gatherings, especially indoors, can increase the spread of respiratory viruses like COVID-19 and flu as we’re seeing after the Thanksgiving holiday,” said Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H., County deputy public health officer. “San Diego County residents know how to keep loved ones safe when gathering for celebrations, as they have done so in the past. Masking, home testing and vaccinations can help ensure you and your families don’t spend this holiday season sick or worse.”
The bivalent COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations are separate shots that are both effective at decreasing the chance of catching the targeted viruses, being hospitalized, or dying. County officials strongly advise all eligible residents get both. Wearing a mask if able, particularly during indoor public gatherings, will help protect you and those around you.
In addition to vaccination and masking, there are a number of other precautions San Diegans can take to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often;
Staying away from sick people;
Staying home and avoiding contact with others when sick;
Home testing when exposed or when ill;
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.

“These steps will help protect our critical hospital capacity and your loved ones,” Kaiser said. “I also want to remind everyone it’s never too late to get a flu shot or a bivalent COVID booster.”
COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Bivalent boosters administered: 449,633 or 18% of 2,493,367 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

15 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Dec. 1, 2022. The region’s total is 5,584.
Of the 15 additional deaths, seven were women and eight were men. They died between March 1, 2022 and Nov. 29, 2022. Five of the newly reported deaths occurred in the last two weeks.
Ten of the people who died were 80 years or older, four were in their 70s and one was in their 60s.
12 of these individuals had been vaccinated and three had not received any COVID-19 vaccines.
All had underlying medical conditions.

COVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing:

5,649 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Nov. 29 to Dec. 5, 2022). The region’s total is now 947,909.
The 5,649 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 3,455 infections identified the previous week (Nov. 22 to Nov. 28, 2022).
6,329 tests were reported to the County on Dec. 3, and the percentage of new positive cases was 12% (Data through Dec. 3).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Dec. 3, is 9.4%.

1201,Flu Testing Appointments Now Available at Seven County COVID-19 Test Sites,San Diegans can now get tested for influenza at seven County sites that formerly only provided COVID-19 testing and certain treatment options. ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/flu-testing-appointments-now-available-at-seven-county-covid-19-test-sites/,2022-12-09T16:50:10-08:00,"
San Diegans can now get tested for influenza at seven County sites that formerly only provided COVID-19 testing and certain treatment options. 
The no-cost testing appointments are being made available at COVID-19 testing locations statewide that are funded through a California Department of Public Health contract. 
Appointments are recommended for the seven locations in San Diego County, although drop-ins will be accommodated if scheduling permits. 
“This is a great resource for our families, friends and neighbors to conveniently find out if that cough, sneeze or achy feeling is the flu or COVID-19 without making a trip to urgent care or an emergency department,” said Dr. Denise Foster, County chief nursing officer. “Those who test positive for COVID can immediately see a telehealth provider to discuss treatment. Those positive with flu can contact their medical provider to discuss next steps, including treatment.” 
The seven locations offering the no-cost testing appointments are open various hours, with at least one open every day of the week.

1202,Supervisors Approve Plan to Address Illicit Fentanyl Crisis,"San Diego County supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to fight the fentanyl crisis by increasing education, outreach and early intervention, working to detect “outbreaks” or clusters of overdoses, and expanding distribution of overdose medication. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/supervisors-approve-plan-to-address-illicit-fentanyl-crisis/,2022-12-13T17:06:49-08:00,"
San Diego County supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to fight the illicit fentanyl crisis by increasing education, outreach and early intervention, working to detect “outbreaks” or clusters of overdoses, and expanding distribution of overdose medication. 
Tuesday’s action comes after the Board of Supervisors and County District Attorney’s office declared fentanyl deaths a public health crisis in late June. 
Supervisors asked County staff then to create a plan to address the rapidly increasing numbers of fentanyl overdose deaths, which spiked to 743 people in the county in 2021. That more than quadrupled the rate from 2019 and accounted for more than 70% of all overdose deaths in 2021.  
Accidental fentanyl overdose deaths nationally have become the number one killer of 18-to 45-year-old people, surpassing deaths from car accidents, gun violence, heart disease and COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Board Chair Nathan Fletcher said Tuesday’s action could give the fentanyl crisis the full attention it deserves and hopefully start progress in fighting it. 
“I’m completely supportive of everything in (this action),” Fletcher said, “the public health messaging, the Narcan (naloxone) distributions, the rapid response to overdose outbreaks.” 
Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. Pharmaceutical fentanyl was approved for treating severe pain, typically for people suffering from advanced cancer, according to the CDC.  
Fentanyl overdoses and deaths have skyrocketed in recent years as illegal drug markets mix it with heroin and cocaine—without the user’s knowledge. 
County Health and Human Services Agency staff told supervisors Tuesday that they will move forward with a four-part strategy to build on the actions the County has already taken to address the problem.  
Conduct Overdose Prevention Education 
HHSA will continue outreach that began in 2021, including a fentanyl awareness campaign viewed more than 10 million times featuring billboards, advertisements in six languages, and social media connecting people to County websites with more information. The expanded campaign will include a media campaign focusing on young people, and presentations and naloxone trainings for parents and community groups. Naloxone is an FDA approved medication designed to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose. 
Expand Naloxone Distribution 
The County launched an expanded naloxone distribution campaign in July that featured naloxone training and outreach. Starting next year, 12 naloxone vending machines will be installed around the county to help people experiencing overdoses.  
New efforts will include working with local colleges and universities to expand naloxone availability and working with County Emergency Medical Services on efforts to “leave behind” naloxone kits when emergency responders answer drug-related calls. 
Early Intervention 
Another key early intervention effort will be working with people who are at higher risk of suffering a fentanyl overdose. That would include people who go to emergency rooms and have suffered a non-fatal overdose. 
Improve Detections of Outbreaks of Overdoses 
Health and Human Services will expand its surveillance and overdose data. That will allow it quickly identify clusters of outbreaks, rather than individual cases, which will allow it to respond rapidly to address outbreaks.

1203,Supervisors Approve Program to Promote Native Plants,"County supervisors approved developing a program to promote the use of native plants Wednesday, to preserve the county’s natural environmental character and unique plant life, reduce water use, stormwater pollution and protect animals from the effects of climate change.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/supervisors-approve-program-to-promote-native-plants/,2022-12-14T15:05:27-08:00,"
County supervisors approved developing a program Wednesday to promote the use of native plants.
The program would aim to preserve the county’s natural environmental character and unique plant life, reduce water use, stormwater pollution and protect animals from the effects of climate change.
The multi-year program will begin with creating a website where people can learn more about native plants, developing educational materials for the public and professional landscapers, and installing demonstration gardens at County buildings. The program would ultimately create incentives to encourage people to use native plants, offer ready-made landscaping templates to incorporate their use, and create a native plant landscaping design manual.
Native plants such as the beautiful California buckwheat, lilacs, oaks and sages that grow wild around the backcountry evolved here over thousands of years. That means they naturally need less water than plants, like non-native flowers and non-indigenous plants that originated in rainier climates. Native plants also provide natural habitat for native animals and pollinating insects.
“These native plants are really what makes San Diego County our county,” said Board Chair Nathan Fletcher, who forwarded the idea of developing a native plant policy with Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer in 2021.
“They’re a real asset,” Fletcher said. “They don’t just foster biodiversity, provide habitat, facilitate our habitat corridors, (provide) drought management and stormwater reduction. There’s a lot of really important reasons why the work and action we’re taking here is important. Not to mention we have some incredibly beautiful plants that really add a feel to our environment and are a constant reminder of the incredible natural resources that are unique to us here in San Diego.”
Lawson-Remer said the native plant program could also benefit the county’s regional economy by expanding the market for landscape design and nursery production.
Staff members from County Land Use and Environment Group departments worked with a group of nearly 60 experts in native plants, landscape ecology and design and habitat conservation, including the California Native Plant Society to lay the groundwork to begin the program.

1204,Sleigh Bells Ring; You Recycling?,"Santa Claus, jingle bells, gifts, packages and — recycling? Yes! The holidays are a great time of the year to put your recycling skills to work, from all that wrapping paper to gift boxes and even our Christmas trees—if you are using a real tree.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/sleigh-bells-ring-you-recycling/,2022-12-15T08:35:03-08:00,"
Santa Claus, jingle bells, gifts, packages and — recycling?
Yes! The holidays are a great time of the year to put your recycling skills to work, from all that wrapping paper to gift boxes and even our Christmas trees—if you are using a real tree.
And, in the holiday spirit of giving, the County Department of Public Works would like to give you some tips on what to recycle and how to do it properly. That way you can even give something back to Mother Earth in this season of giving.
Christmas Trees
We all love our beautiful Christmas trees. But if you’re using a real tree, there eventually comes a time to say goodbye. The County is here to let you know how to recycle it the right way.
Properly recycled trees and wreaths can be turned into mulch that will improve soil health and help soil retain moisture at our parks, farms, home gardens and landscapes. Recycling them also keeps them from going into the trash where they can unnecessarily fill up landfills and generate unwanted climate-changing greenhouse gases as they decompose.
So, check with your waste hauler to find out if they offer curbside pickup. Many of them do.  Or go to the County’s recycling and hazardous waste database, WastefreeSD.org, to find Christmas tree drop-off sites near you. It’s easy.
Type “Christmas tree” in the “find an item” box, add your ZIP code, community and how you heard about the site, and you’ll see all the drop-off locations near you.
Finally, remember, never leave your old dry tree or wreaths lying in the backyard where they can become dangerous fire hazards.
Know What Packaging Can — and Can NOT — be Recycled
Online shopping and gift-giving typically means lots of packaging, and a lot of stuff to recycle. But not all packaging can be recycled. For example, cardboard boxes and kraft paper can be recycled (just break them down and put them in your blue recycling bin). But other items can’t — manila envelopes, padded plastic mailers, bubble-wrap and traditional gift-wrapping materials including metallic wrapping paper, wrapping paper with glitter, ribbons, bows, twine, tissue paper and cellophane. So please DO NOT put them in your blue recycling bins; consider re-using them instead. Here’s a link to learn more about how to Recycle Right, during the holidays and every day.
Christmas and Holiday Card Recycling
Like packaging materials, not all holiday cards should be added to your recycling. Simple paper cards and envelopes can be added to your blue bins. But cards that have glitter, foil, metallic inks (inks made with tiny metal flakes) or other adornments can’t. If there’s a glitzy front and plain paper backing, tear the cards in two. Recycle the backs and put the glitzy fronts into the trash.
Holiday Light Recycling
Please — don’t put old holiday lights in your recycling bins. They can tangle up recycling equipment and they also pose a danger to workers in those recycling centers. For recycling options, please visit WasteFreeSD.org, or contact a scrap metal or e-waste recycler.
So there you have it. Remember, if you have other questions about what can and can’t be recycled, go to DPW Recycling’s webpage or to DPW Recycling’s Facebook page.

1205,"Bivalent COVID Boosters Approved, Available for 6 Months and Older","Bivalent COVID-19 vaccination boosters are now approved and available in San Diego County for children as young as six months of age. The County Health and Human Services Agency is urging parents to protect their children, and themselves, by getting vaccinated with the new booster. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/bivalent-covid-boosters-approved-available-for-6-months-and-older/,2022-12-15T17:16:45-08:00,"
Bivalent COVID-19 vaccination boosters are now approved and available in San Diego County for children as young as six months of age. The County Health and Human Services Agency is urging parents to protect their children, and themselves, by getting vaccinated with the new booster.
The Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has expanded the emergency use of the updated Pfizer and Moderna bivalent booster vaccines for children as young as six months. The FDA previously expanded availability to include 5- to 11-year-olds in October. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California Department of Public Health quickly recommended vaccinations for young children after the FDA approval.
“We can now provide additional protection for children as young as six months of age from COVID-19,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H.  “This is especially important with the high incidence of COVID-19 in our community. Please take advantage and have your children vaccinated to protect them and the rest of your family.”
County residents continue to deal with a triple threat of respiratory diseases this winter season, from COVID-19 to the flu to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Public Health officials still strongly urge people to get vaccinated for both COVID-19 and the flu.
The bivalent COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations are separate shots, but they can be given at the same visit. They effectively decrease the chances of getting infected, being hospitalized, or dying from the separate viruses that each vaccine targets. Boosters are available through healthcare providers and at participating pharmacies. Parents can visit the state’s My Turn website to schedule an appointment.
County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency began offering boosters for children as early as six months age today. Booster dose availability is listed on the County’s COVID-19 vaccinations schedule webpage.
The updated boosters were designed to protect individuals from the worst outcomes of COVID-19, including hospitalization and death. Everyone six months of age and older who has had their primary vaccination series is eligible to get the updated booster two months following any COVID vaccine or booster dose.
County officials also recommend wearing a mask if you are able, particularly during indoor public gatherings, to protect yourself and those around you.
In addition to vaccination and masking, San Diegans can take a number of other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often;
Staying away from sick people;
Staying home and avoiding contact with others when sick;
Home testing when exposed or when ill; Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.

Federal Government Makes Free At-home Tests Available Again:
The White House has moved to make free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County of San Diego COVID-19 testing webpage.
COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

Close to 2.69 million or 80.4% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.

Don’t let your guard down during the holiday rush. Protect yourself from the real-life Grinches – burglars and fraudsters – looking to ruin your presents and plans. The San Diego Sheriff’s Department and District Attorney’s Fraud Division are reminding people of important safety tips as you make your final holiday preparations.
At Home

Always lock your doors and windows especially at night and when you’re away.
Avoid opening doors to strangers.
Place gifts where they cannot be seen from outside your home.
After opening presents, don’t pile up empty gift boxes outside. This gives burglars a hint of expensive items in your home. Instead, fold the boxes and break them up flat inside the recycling bin.
If you see someone casing your alley or neighborhood, report suspicious activity to the Sheriff’s non‐emergency line at (858) 565‐5200.

Online Shopping 

Use one credit card for all online purchases to avoid exposing other cards.
Do NOT click on links from unsolicited emails. Go to the website instead.
Make sure the website is legitimate and secure. Check for the lock icon in the address bar, and make sure the address begins with https.
Make sure the computer you are using has an updated anti-virus protection.
Avoid using a public computer.
Avoid using open Wi-Fi for financial transactions.
Do not trust sellers who ask you to pay with a wire transfer or prepaid debit cards.
Never email personal information, legitimate online marketplaces will not ask you for personal information via email.
If buying or selling items online which require you to meet in person at some point, make sure to meet in a public, well-lit space during normal business hours.
Be careful of online deals that are too good to be true. They often are.


Package delivery
Schedule package deliveries when you are going to be home, but if it is not possible, consider the following suggestions:

Leave special instructions to the delivery person to put the package in a backyard, or somewhere where it’s not visible from the street.
Require that the delivery driver get a signature for the package (from a trusted neighbor).
Track the package.
Sign up for email or text message alerts with estimated delivery times.
Have the postal services or shipping service hold your package at their pick-up facility so you can pick it up in person at your convenience.
If purchasing from a large retailer, request that your package be delivered to a local branch or store so you can pick it up in person.
Get to know your carriers.  If there’s been a problem of thefts in the past, tell them about it.
Insure your packages.
Ask a neighbor or retired relative (who is home) if they will accept your package for you at their home.
Have the package delivered to your workplace if it is permitted.
Buy a locking mailbox big enough for packages.
Consider installing a camera security system that photographs people who come to your door and allows you to communicate with them without opening the door or being home.

When Going on Vacation

Lock up your home and activate your alarm.
Don’t share your plans on social media.
Sign up for a free vacation check by Sheriff’s Senior Volunteer Patrol (SVP) members who can keep an eye on your home. Visit sdsheriff.net/patrol for a Sheriff’s Station and Substation near you.
Hold the delivery of your mail and newspaper or ask a trusted friend to pick them up for you.
Ask a neighbor to occasionally park in your driveway.

1208,Reducing Mental Health Stigma in Black Communities Can Prevent Suicide,"The death of Stephen “tWitch” Boss’ by suicide last week was a shock and heartbreaking to millions.

The death of Stephen “tWitch” Boss’ by suicide last week was a shock and heartbreaking to millions. It also serves as a sad and poignant reminder many people struggle with mental health challenges, but often suffer in silence.
The acclaimed dancer, choreographer, actor, and producer is well-known for his time on the popular television series So You Think You Can Dance and The Ellen DeGeneres Show, as well as for his roles in high-profile films and shows, including Step Up All In, Magic Mike XXL, Disney’s Fairy Tale Weddings, and Modern Family. Boss, 40, is survived by his wife Allison Holker Boss and his three children Zaia, Maddox and Weslie.
“The tragedy of Boss’ death brings visibility and attention to mental health and suicide, which are subjects that can be difficult to talk about, especially within communities of color, and particularly amongst Black Americans,” said Andrew Strong, director of the County of San Diego Office of Equity and Racial Justice. 
“Although members of the Black community are at an increased risk of developing mental health issues due to numerous historical, economic, social, and political factors [that systemically expose Blacks to factors known to be damaging to psychological and physical health], many do not get connected to the mental health services they need,” Strong added.
The statistics are startling.
“Research indicates Black men who experience feelings of anxiety or depression are about half as likely to seek counseling as their non-Black peers,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency.
In 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services found suicide was the leading cause of death for African Americans between the ages of 15 and 24 and the death rate was four times greater for Black men than Black women.  They are also more likely to experience symptoms:

African Americans are 20% more likely to experience serious psychological distress, such as major depressive disorder, than other racial groups, according to the National Institute on Minority Health and Disparities.
Black adults are more likely than white adults to experience persistent symptoms of emotional distress, such as sadness, hopelessness and feeling that they must dedicate extra effort to everything they do, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health.
Between 2015 and 2018, rates of major depressive disorder in young Black adults—ages 18 to 25—increased by more than 3%, yet Black Americans of all age groups were less likely to seek treatment than white Americans, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

Psychologists and other behavioral health professionals are making great strides towards developing more tailored programming to support the mental health of Black men specifically, but there is still much work to be done. Dr. Howard Stevenson, Director of the Racial Empowerment Collaborative at the University of Pennsylvania and a national expert on racial stress and racial trauma, perhaps discussed this best.
“We should place less emphasis on whether Black men are resistant to therapy and more on understanding the contexts in which they already feel comfortable talking about their feelings and traumas. If a Black man is able to find a treatment that is culturally responsive, that he understands, and that embraces the uniqueness of his difference, he is more likely to use that service,” Stevenson shared.
Mental Health Treatment is Available
“Mental health conditions are deeply stigmatized, and sometimes seen as personal weakness or even moral failing,” said Bergmann. “And the persistent stigma that surrounds behavioral and mental health issues can make it challenging for people to seek out and get help. But culturally responsive treatment and supports are available and can be life-saving.” 
It’s important to recognize everyone responds differently to suicide and that there is not a one-size-fits-all approach to coping in the wake of a tragedy.
It is also vital to remember that suicide is preventable, and there are steps you can take to help reduce the risk of suicide.
These steps may include:

Increasing access to mental health resources
Promoting a culture of openness and acceptance around mental health
Knowing the signs of suicide and how to get help

If you or someone you know is struggling, dial 988 or 888-724-7240 to speak with an experienced counselor who can help. They are available seven days per week, 24 hours per day.

1213,County Urges People to Get the Best Gift Available-Vaccinations!,"The County Health and Human Services Agency is urging people to give themselves, their family and friends the best gift available this holiday season―vaccinations to protect against COVID-19 and the flu.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-urges-people-to-get-the-best-gift-available%e2%80%95vaccinations/,2022-12-22T18:23:13-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is urging people to give themselves, their family and friends the best gift available this holiday season― vaccinations to protect against COVID-19 and the flu.
The updated bivalent COVID-19 boosters that provide the greatest protection against COVID-19 were recently made available to everyone six months of age and older.
COVID-19 and the flu are circulating at high levels this winter and vaccinations for both are widely available at local pharmacies and medical providers. The County will also be offering vaccinations throughout the holidays at its vaccination sites. Check online here for the days and hours sites will be open.
“Many San Diegans have taken advantage of the ability to get vaccinated,” said County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “But we can still vaccinate and protect more people. COVID-19 remains highly prevalent in San Diego County, and we’re entering January, the month historically when we’ve had our highest peak number of cases. So please take advantage and complete your vaccinations to protect yourself, your family, and others.”
County officials report that through this week, 80.5% of eligible San Diegans have received their two-shot primary vaccinations, 60.8% have received the primary vaccinations and a booster. They also report that one in five, 20%, of all eligible San Diego residents 5 years and older have received the new bivalent booster.  In addition, 40% of people 65 years of age and older have received the new bivalent booster.
People across the country and here in San Diego County continue to deal with multiple respiratory diseases this winter season, including COVID-19, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Public Health officials still strongly urge people to get vaccinated for both COVID-19 and the flu.
The bivalent COVID-19 booster and flu vaccinations are separate shots, but they can be given at the same visit. They decrease the chances of getting infected, but more importantly, they effectively reduce the risk of severe illness and complications like hospitalization and death. Boosters are available through local participating pharmacies and healthcare providers. People can visit the state’s My Turn website to schedule an appointment. Booster dose availability is listed on the County’s COVID-19 vaccinations schedule webpage.
Holiday Prevention Measures
County officials also recommend wearing a mask if you are able, particularly during indoor public gatherings, to protect yourself and those around you.
In addition to vaccination and masking, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often
Staying away from sick people
Staying home and avoiding contact with others when sick
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces
Home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County of San Diego COVID-19 testing webpage.

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress:

More than 2.69 million or 80.5% of San Diegans received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.

1216,Bark in the Mew Year with Pet Adoption,Why not start out 2023 with more love and companionship in your life? The San Diego County Department of Animal Services is offering a name your price adoption special for animals from Jan. 1-8 only.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210386,2023-01-01T08:00:17-08:00,"
Why not start out 2023 with more love and companionship in your life? The San Diego County Department of Animal Services is offering a name your price adoption special for animals from Jan. 1-8 only.
Many dogs, cats, tortoises, rabbits, chickens and pigs are looking for new homes and families.
“This is the time of year when many of us resolve to spread kindness, be more active, make new friends and generally make changes that will improve our well-being. Pets can help us achieve some of our goals,” said County Animal Services Director Kelly Campbell. “Animals are a natural stress-reliever and they thrive on your kindness and affection which they return in kind, sometimes multiplied 10 times over.”
Included in the Bark in the Mew Year special, all animals will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.
The first step to finding a new best friend is browsing all the lovable animals from cats to dogs to chickens and pigs available now on the  Adoptions page.  Animal Services staff recommend picking out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person.
Walk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.
Fill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.

1217,Get Important Tools That Could Save Someone’s Life ,Knowing how to perform CPR and how to locate and use an AED can help someone when seconds are critical.  The collapse of Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin during an NFL Monday Night Football game was a heart-wrenching sight.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/get-important-tools-that-could-save-someones-life/,2023-01-04T09:39:47-08:00,"
Knowing how to perform CPR and how to locate and use an AED, automated external defibrillator, can help someone when seconds are critical. 
The collapse of Buffalo Bills player Damar Hamlin during an NFL Monday Night Football game was a heart-wrenching sight. Medical professionals provided immediate support on the field, and it’s a vital reminder that you can learn some of those life-saving skills to help in an emergency.  
Medical experts say every second counts once cardiac arrest has brought about the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing, and consciousness. Quick actions like CPR and defibrillation can improve outcomes while waiting for medical professionals to arrive. 
CPR, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, is used when the heart can’t pump blood to the rest of the body. It uses chest compressions to mimic how the heart pumps. Many organizations like the American Heart Association and YMCA provide CPR certification courses.  
An AED can also help someone in cardiac arrest. They are located in many public places, and you can download and use the PulsePoint AED app to help build a regional registry of where the defibrillators are located. The app is the companion to the PulsePoint Respond app, which notifies nearby responders of a cardiac emergency, providing a map of the location and nearby approved AEDs.  
Another way to be prepared is by caring for your own heart health. Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, according to the World Health Organization, and annually claims the lives of more than 4,600 San Diegans. The disease can lead to heart failure or cardiac arrest. 
“Cardiac arrest is sudden and can be caused by a variety of factors,” said Dr. Jennifer Tuteur, San Diego County’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer. “It often happens to people who didn’t know they had a heart problem. That is why it is so important to understand your heart health by knowing your blood pressure numbers and getting an annual physical. Youth are encouraged to receive a preparticipation physical evaluation, or sports physical, to help keep athletes safe and healthy while participating in sports. ”  
Heart disease is one of three chronic diseases, caused by three behaviors – limited physical activity, poor diet and tobacco use – that lead to over 50% of all deaths worldwide. You can get a free blood pressure screening and learn more about your heart health during the Love Your Heart Week of Action Feb. 11 – 19.

1220,New Year Brings Reminder to Get Vaccinated,The County Health and Human Services Agency is continuing to urge San Diegans to get tested if they develop COVID-19 symptoms and to get vaccinated with the bivalent booster if they haven’t already as the region enters the first week of 2023. COVID-19 cases continue to slowly decline this week.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210438,2023-01-05T17:33:37-08:00,"
The County Health and Human Services Agency is continuing to urge San Diegans to get tested if they develop COVID-19 symptoms and to get vaccinated with the bivalent booster if they haven’t already as the region enters the first week of 2023.
COVID-19 cases remain relatively flat this week. However the County’s new report comes before potential cases from New Year’s gatherings and celebrations might bring a surge.
“It’s never been more important to get tested if you feel COVID-19 symptoms and to get the bivalent booster vaccination if you haven’t,” said County Public Health Officer Dr. Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “It’s still less than two weeks from Christmas and we don’t know what New Year’s celebrations could bring. So, take care of yourself and get tested if you feel sick. If you are not ill, get boosted to stay healthy.”
COVID-19 vaccines, including bivalent boosters, and flu vaccines are widely available at local medical providers and pharmacies. The County continues to offer vaccinations throughout the region at its vaccination sites. Check online for the days and hours sites will be open.
Preventive Measures 
In addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often.
Staying away from sick people.
Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
Conducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests  through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County of San Diego COVID-19 testing webpage.

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress

More than 2.69 million or 80.5% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Bivalent boosters administered: 524,101 or 21% of 2,496,008 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

COVID-19 Deaths

21 additional deaths were reported since the last report on Dec. 29, 2022. The region’s total is 5,662.
Of the 21 additional deaths, 13 were women and eight were men. They died between Sept. 4, 2022, and Dec. 28, 2022. Twelve of the newly reported deaths occurred in the past two weeks.
Ten of the people who died were 80 or older, five were in their 70s, five were in their 60s and one was in their 50s.
Fourteen of the people had been vaccinated and seven had not received any COVID-19 vaccines.
19 had underlying medical conditions. Two determinations of underlying medical conditions are pending.

COVID-19 Cases, Case Rates and Testing

4,714 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days (Dec. 27, 2022, to Jan. 2, 2023). The region’s total is now 967,078.
The 4,714 cases reported in the past week were higher compared to the 4,537 infections identified the previous week (Dec. 20, 2022, through Dec. 26, 2022).
4,456 tests were reported to the County on Dec. 31, 2022 and the percentage of new positive cases was 13.6% (Data through Dec. 31, 2022).
The 14-day rolling percentage of positive cases, among tests reported through Dec. 31, 2022 is 12.4%.

Influenza Activity
The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators, including flu cases and deaths.
For the week ending Dec. 31, 2022, the report shows the following:

One additional flu death; the season’s total is now 30.
The additional flu death was a woman who died Dec. 28, 2022.
The woman had received a flu shot this season.
She had underlying medical conditions and was not coinfected with COVID-19.
Emergency department visits for influenza-like illness: 6% of all visits (compared with 6% the previous week).
Lab-confirmed influenza cases for the week: 643 (compared to 912 the previous week).
Total lab-confirmed cases to date: 20,030 (compared to 1,253 at the same time last season and a 3,144 prior 5-year average during the same week).

1221,"COVID-19, Affordable Housing Among Top 10 CNC stories in 2022","There was a lot going on in San Diego County in 2022, from the continuing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, to working to end homelessness, create more affordable housing and the 2022 elections.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210443,2023-01-06T12:14:28-08:00,"
There was a lot going on in San Diego County in 2022, from the continuing fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, to working to end homelessness, create more affordable housing and the 2022 elections.
Here’s a glimpse of the Top 10 most viewed topics and stories from our County News Center over the past year. All the hard news and unusual stories that caught your eyes.
COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic continued to be the most important and widely watched story in 2022. The County’s Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) continued to provide vaccinations including the bivalent booster, treatments and weekly updates as COVID-19 cases continued. As 2023 begins, COVID-19 cases and emerging variants continue to be detected and County health officials continue to urge people to get vaccinated or boosted if they haven’t been already.
Today, more than 80% of all San Diegans have received their primary series of COVID-19 vaccinations and more than 20% have been boosted with the bivalent vaccine. And cases and the rates of hospitalizations and deaths have decreased from the surges in January and summer 2022. Here’s some of the County News Center’s continuing coverage.
Mpox
Public health was definitely the biggest story of the year for the County. As January 2023 begins, County residents are still dealing with a triple threat of illnesses, including COVID-19, a difficult flu season and a spike in “RSV”―respiratory syncytial virus. But before that triple threat, starting in the summer of 2022, the region and U.S. also dealt with an outbreak of the Mpox virus. An outbreak of hundreds of local cases prompted the County to declare a local emergency and provide thousands of vaccinations.
MEHKO (Micro Enterprise Home Kitchens)
Economic opportunities came knocking for aspiring local chefs in February 2022 when the County officially opened its application process for people looking to turn their homes or apartments into mini restaurants. County supervisors unanimously approved a two-year pilot program the month before to let people countywide operate mini restaurants out of their homes―allowed to serve up to 30 in-person, take-out or delivery meals a day, up to 60 meals a week.
New district boundaries
More than 1 million San Diego County residents ― three out of every 10 ― woke up in a new supervisorial district in January 2022. That was because the boundaries of their County districts were revised by an independent redistricting commission that worked more than a year with public input in a series of 49 meetings. Redistricting is done once every 10 years, using U.S. Census data to ensure that voting districts contain roughly the same number of people. The new boundaries marked the first time they were created by an independent commission.
Affordable housing
Affordable housing was a huge story for San Diego County in 2022. The County Board of Supervisors spent millions of dollars and worked with numerous other cities and organizations to build housing to help people with low-incomes, people experiencing homelessness, seniors and veterans. There were affordable housing communities in City Heights, in Carlsbad, Vista, and in downtown San Diego. In a first of its kind project for the County, it used its own surplus property to begin transforming an empty lot into a site for low-income affordable housing. Since 2017, the County has leveraged about $1 billion in federal and state funding by investing more than $175 million on 44 affordable housing projects in 24 communities, many completed, others under construction and more on the way.
RSV
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, known as RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But a wave of cases, first detected here locally at a high school in October, became part of a triple threat viral wave with COVID-19 and the flu that threatened to overwhelm hospital emergency rooms.
Hurricane
You don’t often hear “hurricane” and San Diego County in the same sentence. So when you do, it draws a lot of attention. In September 2022, Hurricane Kay, forming off the coast of Mexico, generated a storm of concern that San Diego County would indirectly suffer big rains, big winds, and oddly, high temperatures. All that generated lots of interest in free County sandbags!
Election
Election years always generate lots of interest for County News Center viewers, from the flawlessly run primary in June to the general election in November.
Summer movies, Parks and Library
Hey, living in San Diego County has its perks! And our residents are always interested in going to our parks and libraries!
Naloxone
The fentanyl crisis, called the single deadliest drug threat the U.S. has ever faced by the Drug Enforcement Agency, has been deeply felt in San Diego County. Naloxone, or Narcan is an FDA approved medication designed to rapidly reverse an opioid overdose. And it is a key part of the County’s strategy to fight opioid and fentanyl overdose deaths―whether that’s working to expand its distribution, creating “leave behind” kits, or even installing naloxone vending machines around the county.

1222,Six Newly Elected County Officials Ceremonially Sworn into Office Monday,Six County officials took their oaths of office during a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony at the County Administration Center on Monday. Four were incumbents and two are new to their offices.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210453,2023-01-09T13:51:49-08:00,"
Six County officials took their oaths of office during a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony at the County Administration Center on Monday. Four were incumbents and two are new to their offices.
Supervisor Nathan Fletcher was re-elected to a second four-year term. He represents the Fourth District, which includes the cities of Lemon Grove and La Mesa, parts of the City of San Diego, and unincorporated communities including Casa De Oro-Mount Helix, Rancho San Diego and Spring Valley. He was sworn in by Patrick Casao, Jr.
During his remarks, Supervisor Fletcher highlighted the many ways the County has moved forward in issues important to the County. He also quoted Dr. Martin Luther King.
“We cannot walk alone, and as we walk; we must make the pledge that we will march ahead. We cannot turn back,” said Supervisor Fletcher. “Our County government has turned in a stronger direction in the last four years and we cannot turn back. We have to continue those efforts moving forward on a path to a more perfect union and I’m honored to continue to serve.”
Supervisor Jim Desmond was also re-elected to a second four-year term. He represents the Fifth District which spans the North County from Oceanside, Vista and San Marcos to Palomar Mountain, Borrego Springs and Ocotillo Wells. Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians Chairman Bo Mazzetti administered the oath of office.
Supervisor Desmond told the audience he looks forward to working with the board to get things done and solve any issues. He said he works by the same principles as he did during his career as a commercial airline pilot.
“Safety is number one, number two is proper management of the available resources, and quality of life with common sense and practical solutions. That is what I am going to continue in the future,” said Supervisor Desmond. “I look forward to working with this board and solving many of the issues that we still face in San Diego County and make it a better place for all. It is an honor to serve.”
The first woman to be elected sheriff in San Diego County was ceremonially sworn into office. Sheriff Kelly A. Martinez takes over for interim Sheriff Anthony Ray. He was appointed last March after Sheriff Bill Gore resigned. Sheriff Martinez was sworn in by San Diego Superior Court Judge Michael S. Groch.
County District Attorney Summer Stephan won a second term of office. She was sworn in by San Diego Superior Court Presiding Judge Michael T. Smyth.
Both Sheriff Martinez and D.A. Stephan will serve a six-year term. A new state law extended the four-year term to six for sheriffs and district attorneys elected in 2022. The six-year term will put future law enforcement elections on track with presidential elections.
Jordan Marks was elected to his first term in office as Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk. The oath of office was administered by three-term former Assessor/Recorder/Clerk Ernest Dronenburg, Jr.
Treasurer-Tax Collector Dan McAllister was re-elected to his sixth term of office. He was sworn in by Deborah Szekely.

1223,"Tips to Drive Safely, Avoid Flooding in Rainy Conditions",The San Diego County’s Department of Public Works (DPW) road division and the Office of Emergency Services remind residents to drive safely and be flood ready.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/tips-to-drive-safely-avoid-flooding-in-rainy-conditions/,2023-01-09T18:05:57-08:00,"
The San Diego County’s Department of Public Works (DPW) road division and the Office of Emergency Services remind residents to drive safely and be flood ready.
The National Weather Service is forecasting milder rain conditions in San Diego than the central and northern part of the state, but safety precautions always apply on wet roads.
The following 10 tips are important when driving in rainy conditions:

Slow down to avoid getting into an accident. Remember, it takes longer to stop when roads are wet. Allow yourself at least an extra 15 minutes or so to arrive at your destination to adjust for slower traffic.
Turn on your headlights to see better and make it easier for other drivers to see you. It’s the law.
Try to drive toward the middle lanes as water tends to gather in outside lanes.
Defog your windows for better visibility. Rain can cause windows to fog up. Along the same lines, check your windshield wipers preferably before it rains again and replace them as needed.
Avoid driving through deep water because it can affect your brakes. If you cannot avoid it, test your brakes afterward to make sure they’ve dried out and are working properly.
Give the cars in front of you extra distance. The spray from their vehicles — particularly from larger trucks and buses — can hamper your vision. And giving extra space to the guy in front of you also gives you more time to brake or adjust if you need to.
Keep calm, don’t oversteer or stomp on the breaks if you start to hydroplane or skid when your tires lose traction with the wet road. The Department of Motor Vehicles says keep the steering wheel straight and take your foot off the accelerator so your vehicle can slow down slowly.
Turn around, don’t drown. In heavy rains, never drive through a flooded roadway if you cannot see the pavement. Even a few inches of water running at the right velocity can sweep a car, and even a truck, and its occupants off the roadway and downstream. The same tip applies to trying to walk or swim across a flooded roadway.
Stay focused. Remember, it’s illegal, and dangerous, to try to text or use a hand-held cell phone when you’re driving.
Slow down for the cone zone if you see highway or road workers ahead or to your side. Watch out for DPW crews and equipment.

Bonus tip, if you have to travel to where you’ll have to drive in snow, keep up with the weather reports to see if tire chains are required. Be aware conditions on the ground can change rapidly. Also keep some extra safety equipment in your car.
Chain controls, road condition updates, and other safety advisories are posted on DPW’s Facebook and Twitter sites.
Off the roads, while this storm system is not expected to be excessive, residents may want to prepare and learn more about flood risks since floods are the most common natural disaster. The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services has flood ready information to lessen your risk.
DPW’s road division crews keep roads and motorists safe by removing road hazards, closing flooded roadways and plowing roads when bad weather strikes.
The Office of Emergency Services helps residents prepare for disasters and emergencies by encouraging people to create a personal disaster plan, register for emergency updates and download the free SDEmergency app.

1225,County Board of Supervisors Elects New Chair,The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to select Supervisor Nora Vargas as the new Chair of the Board for 2023.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210458,2023-01-10T14:41:58-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to select Supervisor Nora Vargas as the new Chair of the Board for 2023.
Chair Vargas succeeds Supervisor Nathan Fletcher who served as chair for the last two years. The chair acts as the official voice for the board. The chair also presides over its meetings and nominates other supervisors to various committees.
During Tuesday’s organizational meeting, Supervisor Terra Lawson-Remer was  elected as vice chair and Supervisor Joel Anderson as chair pro tempore.
Chair Vargas was the first Latina elected to the Board of Supervisors in 2020 and is now the first Latina selected as board chair.
Chair Vargas gave her remarks in both English and Spanish. She emphasized that everyone must work together to make change happen.
“It’s been tough because at times our chambers have been polarizing but today is a new day and our communities really deserve better… I really strongly believe that we must work together to increase public participation in these meetings, we have to have different voices,” said Chair Vargas. “When we bring different voices to the fold, we can assure that we are serving all communities in the ways that they deserve.”
Chair Vargas expects disagreements when tackling difficult problems, but she hopes they are discussed in a civil manner saying that’s how we find real solutions and that’s what democracy is all about.
Chair Vargas wants to work toward giving residents a good quality of life that includes access to clean air and health care, help for small businesses and families that need childcare. She sees future investments in public transit opportunities, parks and open spaces to help create positive environmental and economic impacts to our region.
“We have a lot of work ahead of us, and that is why I invite everyone who is listening or watching to join us and participate in these proceedings. This is your county, these are your chambers, and I want you to know that when you come before this board, I hear you,” said Chair Vargas. “I look forward to continuing to work with our veterans and our community organizations, our seniors, our small businesses, our faith communities, our labor unions and all who care deeply about building a better county for all.”

1226,Board Approves Plan that Will Revitalize Campo Road Corridor,The County Board of Supervisors approved a plan today that will revitalize the main commercial strip and adjacent residential area along Campo Road in Casa de Oro.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210477,2023-01-11T11:28:10-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors approved a plan today that will revitalize the main commercial strip and adjacent residential area along Campo Road in Casa de Oro.
The Campo Road Corridor Revitalization Specific Plan outlines a new vision for the 60-acre area centered on Campo Road between Rogers Road and Granada Avenue. The goal of the plan is to turn the area from a drive-through commercial corridor into a drive-to destination with a “Main Street” vibe.
The proposed changes will allow better access by public transit, walking and bicycles and turn the corridor into a welcoming destination for area residents and visitors alike.
The plan includes updated traffic management options, like roundabouts and enhanced left turn lanes, wider sidewalks, on-street parking and protected bike lanes.
It also outlines plans to change the zoning laws to allow for additional mixed-use housing development along the corridor. Current zoning only allows for two-story mixed-use developments with commercial businesses on the ground floor and residential units above. The proposed changes would allow for mixed-use developments with an additional floor, expanding affordable housing opportunities in the area.
Gathering Community Input
Since 2017, the County has hosted dozens of public forums, community meetings and workshops to allow the community to share their ideas for the area and establish a long-term vision for its enhancement.
“Our new plan to completely revitalize the Campo Road corridor has been a community-driven process,” said Supervisor Nathan Fletcher. “Our community ultimately chose to reduce the number of lanes of traffic and to take things in a new direction to make their community more walkable and inviting. And the County on behalf of this community will pursue grant funding to help make some of the projects in the plan a reality; this is an example of democracy working, and I am excited to be a part of it.”
To achieve the vision of the plan, the County has already applied for more than $3 million dollars in grant money to fund preliminary engineering studies, plans and specifications for the roadway reconfiguration of Campo Road. Planning & Development Services (PDS) staff will continue to identify further funding opportunities to bring the plan to life.
“The specific plan components will not only make our community safer but also provide the clear and necessary vision to turn the Campo Road corridor into a vibrant destination benefiting businesses, residents and visitors,” said Lisa Stewart, President of the Casa de Oro Alliance.
The plan aligns with the County’s General Plan and adds new affordable housing and commercial growth in areas with high access to public transit, services, and amenities. The effort also aligns with the County’s sustainability strategic initiative by actively addressing climate change through innovative policies and sustainable facility construction.
About PDS

1228,Protect your EBT Cards,"As Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT, thefts continue to happen both locally and throughout the state, people are encouraged to take easy steps to protect their benefits. EBT cards provide monthly funds from the USDA Food and Nutrition Service for people to buy food.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/protect-your-ebt-cards/,2023-01-12T16:58:49-08:00,"
As Electronic Benefit Transfer, or EBT, thefts continue to happen both locally and throughout the state, people are encouraged to take easy steps to protect their benefits. EBT cards provide monthly funds from the USDA Food and Nutrition Service for people to buy food.
The most common ways benefits are stolen are skimming and scamming. To help prevent those from happening, never share personal information like your social security number, bank information, EBT card or PIN number with strangers or organizations you are not familiar with.
The State of California and the County of San Diego will NEVER call or text asking for your card or PIN number. You can protect your PIN number by keeping it a secret, not writing it down, assuring others do not see you input your pin and changing your PIN number often.
You can also sign up for direct deposit if you are a part of the CalWORKs Program, so benefits go directly into your bank account instead of a card. Many banks offer free accounts if you sign up for direct deposit. You can enroll or stop direct deposit at any time. Each month you will be able to access your benefits on time through your bank account. This protects your benefits and prevents fraud.
While the County is able to replace stolen benefits in most cases, this process typically takes a few days and does not guarantee you will get your money back.
The state is working to upgrade EBT security technology. Until that happens, and even after, the County recommends that everyone take these steps to protect their benefits.

1229,"State Closing Some Testing Sites, Still Plenty Testing, Treatment Available","Two state COVID-19 testing and treatment sites in San Diego County are scheduled to close in the next two weeks, and the state plans to close the remaining four here by Feb. 25 because of declining demand. However, County public health officials said there are still plenty of places and options for San Diegans to get testing and treatment. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210495,2023-01-12T18:32:13-08:00,"
Two state COVID-19 testing and treatment sites in San Diego County are scheduled to close in the next two weeks, and the state plans to close the remaining four here by Feb. 25 because of declining demand. 
However, County public health officials said there are still plenty of places and options for San Diegans to get testing and treatment. 
The state-supported testing/treatment site in Escondido is scheduled to close this week and the one in El Cajon is scheduled to close the following week, both because so few people are going to them for tests. The state closed its National City testing site last week for the same reasons. San Diegans can still get tested at three County-contracted sites, local pharmacies and their healthcare providers, as well as at the four remaining local state sites until they close Feb. 25. 
People can also get free COVID-19 home tests at the County’s six Public Health Centers, many local libraries—check with your library to see if they have them—and from the federal government by mail. 
“We want all San Diegans to know that there are lots of options to get tests, be tested, get treatment, and get vaccinated, no matter where you are in the county,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “If you feel symptoms and want to get tested for COVID-19 and find treatment, if you are positive, or if you just want to have COVID-19 home tests available as a precaution, access is available and you have options.”
COVID-19 cases decreased slightly this week. However, health officials are still monitoring wastewater testing and say they are seeing increasing levels of the virus, which may be a sign of a possible surge in cases. Flu cases and Respiratory Syncytial Virus infections both continue to decline. 
County health officials continue to urge people to get vaccinated and boosted if they haven’t already to protect themselves. COVID-19 vaccines, including bivalent boosters, and flu vaccines are widely available at local medical providers and pharmacies. The County continues to offer vaccinations throughout the region.  Check online  for the days and hours sites will be open. 
Preventive Measures  
In addition to staying up to date with COVID vaccination, especially receiving a bivalent booster, and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include: 

Washing hands thoroughly and often. 
Staying away from sick people. 
Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings. 
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces. 
Conducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can  order one pack of four free tests  through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County of San Diego  COVID-19 testing webpage. 

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress  

More than 2.69 million or 80.5% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.  
Bivalent boosters administered: 538,060 or 21.6% of 2,496,758 eligible San Diegans.  
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine. 

The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the  Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report  weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators.

A community input tour to help select between two concepts to honor the Tubman-Chavez Community Center is planned from January 14 through February 4. During tour stops, community members are invited to share their thoughts on a planned new display that will spotlight the rich history of Tubman-Chavez.
“Tubman Chavez Stories: A Community Cultural Display,” will honor the legacy and tell the stories of the community center which opened in 1995 and served the Southeastern San Diego community as a unifying gathering place.
The selected exhibit will be housed inside the main lobby corridor of the County of San Diego’s new Southeastern Live Well Center. Set to open this summer, the new center includes the former Tubman-Chavez Community Center property at the corner of Market Street and Euclid Avenue.
“It’s important to highlight and celebrate the diverse history of this area by telling the vibrant stories of the Tubman-Chavez Community Center,” said Barbara Jiménez, County Community Operations Officer, Department of Homeless Solutions & Equitable Communities. “This historical display will support the vision to embrace the heart, spirit and legacy of that space, which continues today.”
Organized by Leah Goodwin of Leah Goodwin Creations, the project’s art consultant, the cultural display will feature artifacts, historic photos, audio recordings and videos that tell the story of the Tubman Chavez Community Center.
The Community Input Tour will bring the two design concepts to the public at a number of upcoming events (see below). A full list of locations, and the option to provide feedback online, will be available online at livewellsd.org/SELWC.
“The voice of our community members has been so important in the creation of the Southeastern Live Well Center and this cultural display honoring the history of the Tubman-Chavez Community Center is a vital piece,” Goodwin explained. “We are looking forward to receiving the community’s feedback and implementing it in this new space.”
Tubman-Chavez Stories Display Concept A
Tubman-Chavez Stories Display Concept B
The Southeastern Live Well Center will house self-sufficiency and family strengthening services, financial and employment assistance, public health, behavioral health, child support, restorative justice, services for older adults and people with disabilities, and military and veterans’ services as well as space for community-based organizations and community meetings.

The County of San Diego is seeking input from residents and community partners to better understand the impact of gun violence on our communities.  The Gun Violence Reduction Advisory Group is conducting a survey to:

Better understand the scope of gun violence in the region and the communities most affected
Identify resources within our communities and best practices in gun violence prevention, intervention, and aftercare
Identify gaps and challenges to reducing gun violence and community concerns
Explore potential solutions our communities would like to see to reduce gun violence

The survey was designed to gather the community’s thoughts, experiences and perspectives around gun violence. For context, gun violence refers to all types of gun violence, including suicide; family, domestic partner, and intimate partner violence; and community violence.
To complete the Gun Violence Reduction Survey, visit the Engage San Diego County site and click on the orange gun violence reduction project logo. You can also go directly to the survey here.
The Gun Violence Reduction Project is already listening to feedback.  Seven Community Listening Sessions have been hosted throughout the County.  Two additional sessions were held in partnership with youth-serving organizations. Sessions were attended by more than 300 people wanting to discuss gun violence in their communities.

County Animal Services officers rescued an 11-year-old dog from an oil-filled mechanic’s well inside a private garage in Ramona.  The owner of the shop called the County Department of Animal Services the morning of Jan. 17 saying a dog was trapped.

When the officers arrived, they found Mia, a Siberian Husky mix, about ten feet underground in the hole, trying to escape the oil.  Mia had been down there for more than a day, was weighed down by the oil and was exhausted.
Lt. Talia Padilla and Officers Alyssa Moreno and Michael Moore safely lifted Mia out of the well using some tools and critical thinking skills.

Mia was taken to the Bonita shelter where Padilla and the medical team worked to clean the oil from her and begin medical treatment.
Registered Veterinary Technician Sarah Vega and Lt. Talia Padilla washing Mia the Siberian Husky
The Animal Services team scanned Mia and found a microchip which allowed them to reach her family.  They told officers Mia had been missing since Saturday and quickly came to get her.
With more care from the owner’s personal veterinarian, Mia should make a full recovery.

1237,New County Study Advances Ways to Close Digital Divide in Unincorporated Area,"A recent analysis of census data as part of the County Comprehensive Broadband Plan showed that approximately 37,000 households in the unincorporated area of San Diego don’t have a broadband internet subscription.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210553,2023-01-19T10:35:18-08:00,"
A recent analysis of census data as part of the County Comprehensive Broadband Plan showed that approximately 37,000 households in the unincorporated area of San Diego don’t have a broadband internet subscription. This places them at a disadvantage when it comes to things such as online education, healthcare services or emergency notifications.
The report is the latest effort by the County to address inadequate broadband infrastructure and access in its communities.
Reliable and affordable internet access is a basic need in today’s connected world. Just ask Warner Springs resident and emergency volunteer Melissa Krogh, who recently signed up for Starlink internet after years of suffering with less than stellar service.
“Having a reliable way to communicate can very literally be a matter of life or death for us in the rural communities,” Krogh said. “Whether it is the need to check on our elderly, call 911 in an emergency, or for educational purposes, being connected is an important aspect of modern life and all of my neighbors in the rural communities should be able to procure reliable internet for themselves and their families.”
The Plan supports the County’s efforts in attempting to close the digital divide in the unincorporated area by identifying problem areas and the partnerships, infrastructure and education needed to change that. The report helps the County’s expansion of its own infrastructure and identifies the need to work with the private sector, other public agencies and local stakeholders to deliver needed changes, including necessary funding.
We surveyed residents in the unincorporated area and here’s what they had to say:

92% of surveyed residents in the unincorporated area did not maintain an at-home internet subscription as a result of availability, reliability, or affordability concerns
58% of these residents say internet access is not available in their area
19% say internet access is too expensive
15% say internet speeds are too slow
Areas in need of infrastructure tend to be located in rural, desert, mountainous areas in north and east county (e.g., Valley Center, Mountain Empire).
These “internet deserts” are typically more rural, more mountainous, and lower income than their suburban peers. Residents within these communities often pay higher prices for lower speed internet access.
Communities with low access in the region tend to be more rural and have populations with non-English speakers, lower education levels, and more poverty than average in the county.
Income influences access to quality internet speed.


Actions the County has already taken to improve internet access

Thanks to a $4.3M federal grant, the County Library was already able to create the Tech Connect program which puts laptops and Mi-Fi hot spots into the hands of 7,000 people in its service area who lack access to the internet and a computer. Library card holders can check out a laptop and air card for one year, free of charge.


The County has also partnered with SANDAG on its Get Connected Campaign to advance affordable internet service and digital literacy programs.


Through a partnership with Caltrans, we have identified opportunities to leverage already planned roadway projects to deploy fiber and expand high-speed broadband service to our underserved communities at the same time.

What’s Next
The Plan identifies areas with connectivity gaps and prioritizes them by greatest need, including lack of access and affordable options. The County will use the Plan to identify the type of infrastructure projects to increase connectivity in these areas, such as installing more fiber optic cables in certain areas. The Plan will also help the County determine how it can best collaborate with others. By implementing the Plan’s strategy, the County will continue to build regional partnerships and engage public and private entities to work together to expand broadband access to all residents.

More than 540,000 San Diegans have protected themselves, their family and friends by getting a bivalent COVID-19 booster since it became available in September 2022. County health officials are urging more to do the same as we start the new year. 
The COVID-19 virus is still widespread in our neighborhoods and county. County public health officials are specifically urging people 65 years of age and older―the group most at risk from serious complications, including death, of COVID-19―to get a bivalent booster.  
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California Department of Public Health a recommend bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older. 
Numerous studies have reported that the bivalent booster is more effective in protecting people from serious complications from COVID-19, including the newest Omicron variants that now make up four of every 10 cases in the U.S.  
“It’s very important that San Diegans not let their guards down and continue to protect themselves by getting vaccinated if they haven’t been already,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “The virus is still circulating in the region. We’re still seeing high percentages of positive COVID-19 tests and detecting high levels of the virus in wastewater. Vaccinations, including bivalent boosters, can help protect you from getting seriously ill or even dying.”
The County Health and Human Services Agency reports 519,371 San Diegans chose to get the bivalent booster in the four months from when they were introduced September through the end of 2022. That included 126,772 in September, 178,256 in October, 123,450 in November and 90,893 in December. To date in January, 28,747 have obtained the bivalent booster. 
COVID-19 vaccines, including bivalent boosters, and flu vaccines are widely available at local medical providers and pharmacies. The County continues to offer vaccinations throughout the region at its vaccination sites. Check online for the days and hours sites will be open.   
 Preventive Measures   
 In addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:   

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often.   


Staying away from sick people.   


Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.

1239,VIDEO: County and Local Law Enforcement Hand Out Naloxone Kits to Save Lives,The County and Sheriff’s department announced the expansion of a partnership for the distribution of naloxone as part of a Comprehensive Harm Reduction Plan to help fight the illicit fentanyl crisis.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/?p=210622,2023-01-23T17:49:42-08:00,"
The County and Sheriff’s department announced the expansion of a partnership for the distribution of naloxone as part of a Comprehensive Harm Reduction Plan to help fight the illicit fentanyl crisis. Sheriff’s deputies, first responders and other law enforcement agencies will hand out the kits, which can reverse the effects of an overdose, to people who may be at risk or know someone at risk of overdose. Each kit contains a box of naloxone with two nasal sprays and instructions in both English and Spanish.
Drug overdoses are at crisis levels. A recent Medical Examiner Report shows accidental deaths involving drugs or alcohol have increased 139 percent in the past five years. In 2021, fentanyl was responsible for 62 percent of overdose deaths. For children and infants under five years of age, Rady Children’s Hospital reports accidental fentanyl ingestion has increased 1,600 percent in the past four years.
Naloxone is a needle-free medication sprayed up a person’s nose that reverses the effects of an opioid overdose. It is safe, effective, and easy to use. A countywide public health order allows public health centers and outreach workers to provide naloxone to anyone.
The County offers numerous prevention and treatment programs across the region. People seeking help should call the San Diego County Access and Crisis Line 888-724-7240 or 2-1-1 San Diego. These resources are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1240,Youth Transitioning out of Foster Care to See Increased Support,The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously today to accept recommendations from Child Welfare Services (CWS) to increase funding to support foster youth for up to three years as they transition out of care. ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/youth-transitioning-out-of-foster-care-to-see-increased-support/,2023-01-24T13:11:49-08:00,"
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to accept recommendations from Child Welfare Services (CWS) to increase funding to support foster youth for up to three years as they transition out of care. 
The vote provided $2.7 million in state funding over the next three fiscal years for housing and wraparound services for young adults 18 to 25 years old.  
The region’s high cost of living was one of the major factors behind the increase. The additional program funding was only made available to 11 California counties with the highest rent.  
Going forward, each participating youth will receive $3,710 a month, a $900 increase compared to the current rate.  
In 2001, the state established the Transitional Housing Program– Plus, which provides affordable housing and wraparound services for foster youth 18 to 21 years old for up to two years. 
Other bills extended the opportunity for foster youth to stay in the foster care system until age 21 and added housing assistance services. The Transitional Housing Program provides up to three cumulative years of support for foster youth from 18 to 25 years old.  
Data shows the difference this kind of investment can make.  
“In fiscal year 2021 to 2022, more than 400 youth were served by the Transitional Housing Program and 93 percent maintained stable housing over the course of the fiscal year,” said Kim Giardina, director of Child Welfare Services. “This program keeps vulnerable young adults off the streets, in an environment where they can pursue higher education and become successful members of society.” 
Nearly all youth enrolled in the program accessed needed medical, dental and mental healthcare, while 97 percent enrolled in an educational or vocational training program and successfully completed the term.  
Each year about 100 youth leave foster care in San Diego and rely on this program to provide a safe place to sleep, eat and study. CWS partners with nonprofits to ensure the inclusion of youth in underserved communities and those with increased barriers to safe and affordable housing.

1241,Board Paves Way for Taxation of Cannabis Businesses in the Unincorporated Area,The County Board of Supervisors voted today to set taxation rates for existing cannabis businesses in the unincorporated area.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/board-paves-way-for-taxation-of-cannabis-businesses-in-the-unincorporated-area/,2023-01-24T17:11:37-08:00,"
The County Board of Supervisors voted today to set taxation rates for existing cannabis businesses in the unincorporated area.
Today’s action only applies to the unincorporated area of the county, where five licensed cannabis businesses currently exist.
The new tax will apply to both medical and recreational operations and will be assessed based on the type of cannabis business. Cultivation businesses will be taxed based on square footage of growing area and lighting method, and all other types of cannabis businesses will be taxed based on a percentage of gross income.
Supervisors voted in favor of imposing a 2 percent tax on all retail sales of cannabis products in the unincorporated area.
Today’s Board vote is one of the initial steps the County is taking to implement Measure A, which San Diegans approved during the November 8, 2022 election.
The next step is for the Board to finalize approval of the rates during a second hearing scheduled for the end of February. Pending the second hearing, cannabis businesses would implement the new tax at the beginning of April and begin paying the County in July.
The Board is expected to take further action later this summer when Planning and Development Services and the Office of Equity and Racial Justice will introduce additional policy measures and proposed licensing requirements.

1243,Active Tuberculosis Reported at  Boys & Girls Club National City,"Students and staff at Boys & Girls Club’s National City location and some Boys & Girl Club summer camp sites may have been exposed to tuberculosis, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/active-tuberculosis-reported-at-boys-girls-club-national-city/,2023-01-26T15:21:04-08:00,"
Students and staff at Boys & Girls Club’s National City location and some Boys & Girl Club summer camp sites may have been exposed to tuberculosis, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
HHSA Public Health Services department and the Boys and Girls Club officials have worked in close collaboration to identify and notify those with a high risk of exposure to tuberculosis (TB). No-cost testing will be provided to individuals at increased risk for infection. The period of exposure is from May 28, 2022, to Nov. 8, 2022.
Tuberculosis is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person to person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. The bacteria are spread when someone sick with TB coughs, speaks, sings or breathes. People with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB should get tested.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill in the future, sometimes even years later. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected. All those notified of a high risk of exposure are encouraged to receive no-cost testing.”
Effective treatments are available to cure people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for individuals with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune compromised to see their medical provider to rule out active tuberculosis and to discuss treatment.
People who test positive for TB but who don’t have symptoms of active TB should get a chest x-ray and talk to a medical provider, as they most likely have a latent TB infection.  People in this situation are infected with the TB germs, but the infection is essentially dormant or sleeping. Taking medicines for latent TB infection can keep these people from getting sick.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure should call:

Boys and Girls Club National City at (619) 452-1859
San Diego County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621

The number of people diagnosed with active TB in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 192 in 2020 and 201 people reported with active disease in 2021. Preliminary data shows 208 people were reported to have active TB disease in 2022. An estimated 175,000 people in San Diego County have latent TB infection and are at risk for developing active TB without preventive treatment.

1244,Annual Point in Time Count Draws Hundreds of Volunteers,"Nearly 1,500 volunteers walked the streets of San Diego County early this morning looking to engage with people experiencing homelessness as part of the region’s Point in Time Count.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/annual-point-in-time-count-draws-hundreds-of-volunteers/,2023-01-26T15:48:58-08:00,"
Nearly 1,500 volunteers walked the streets of San Diego County early this morning looking to engage with people experiencing homelessness as part of the region’s Point in Time Count.
The annual count led by the Regional Task Force on Homelessness provides a one-day snapshot of unsheltered San Diegans and those in emergency shelters.
“The annual Point in Time Count helps us get an idea of the unsheltered population in our region in order to connect them with resources.” said Barbara Jiménez, County Community Operations Officer, Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities. “It’s also an opportunity for more County employees to interact with our neighbors experiencing homelessness.”

Volunteers began the day at 4 a.m. in one of 36 different sites throughout the County where they split into teams to walk or drive around their designated areas looking for people living outside.
254 County employees volunteered to take part in the Point in Time Count this year including Beatrice Maleno and Dahiana Jimenez who work in the Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities and Maria Lischin, a social worker III with Aging and Independence Services.
“Participating in the Point in Time Count for over five years has afforded me the opportunity to advocate for resources,” said Beatrice, Program Specialist II in the Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities. “It’s important so that we as a community can build and create permanent housing solutions that allow our most vulnerable to thrive and live their best lives.”

Beatrice and her volunteer group, who surveyed areas in Vista, first came across a group of three people. They were laying on cardboard outside a payday advance business. Two men agreed to speak with them and answer a short questionnaire.
One of the men told them that a medical condition had impacted his ability to work. The other man said he was experiencing homelessness for the first time. Dahiana gave him a McDonald’s gift card before he rushed off saying he was heading to work.
The third man was sleeping, so his location was noted so that outreach workers would know where to find him when they make contact with him at later time.

Next, the team found three more people. Two men and a woman were set up to sleep outside a tire shop. They had sought shelter behind a large tire. One of the men who agreed to take the survey said he had been experiencing homelessness for the past seven years.
Around 7 a.m., Beatrice, Dahiana and Maria met two more people who were picking up their blankets after waking up at a small business center.

While the woman answered the survey, her dog vied for attention from volunteers. When Dahiana gave the woman the McDonald’s gift card, she turned to her dog and promised her a special treat.
“Being a social worker for the unsheltered community means that I am walking alongside my clients and assisting them to the next stage in their life journey,” Dahiana explained.
The information from the completed surveys is used to apply for federal and state funding to help people experiencing homelessness and find solutions on how to best serve them.
The County has multiple programs in place that could connect homeless people to the services they need and help them find a stable place to live. You can find more information here or by calling 2-1-1.

1245,County Partners with City to Open New Homeless Shelter at Old Central Library,"Over two dozen women experiencing homelessness downtown have a new option for a warm, safe place to sleep. A homeless shelter at the old Central Library on E Street is now open and has 36 beds available overnight to women exclusively.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-partners-with-city-to-open-new-homeless-shelter-at-old-central-library/,2023-01-26T17:10:02-08:00,"
Over two dozen women experiencing homelessness downtown have a new option for a warm, safe place to sleep. A homeless shelter at the old Central Library on E Street is now open and has 36 beds available overnight to women exclusively.
The shelter will be operated by NAMI, the National Alliance for Mental Illness, and provide case management, access to social services and housing support. It will be open through the night for any female who shows up at the door requesting a bed, regardless of the hour.
The County provided $322,000 in funding for the shelter as part of a $10 million dollar grant program to support shelter opportunities for the unhoused throughout the region. It is one of four City of San Diego projects receiving funding not including the Rosecrans shelter.
“It is important for the County to support a variety of housing options throughout the region,” said County Health and Human Services Agency Director Nick Macchione. “When it comes to addressing homelessness, there is no single right answer.”
A total of nine projects have been identified to receive county grant money which will create 372 new shelter beds across six cities. The projects range from serving families and seniors to providing safe parking and sleeping cabins.

1246,CDC Study Reports Bivalent Boosters Protect Against COVID-19 Variants,A new study released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new bivalent COVID-19 boosters add protection against the new variants of the virus. Another study showed that the bivalent vaccine also protects against severe disease.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/cdc-study-reports-bivalent-boosters-protect-against-covid-19-variants/,2023-01-26T19:40:02-08:00,"
A new study released this week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the new bivalent COVID-19 boosters add protection against the new variants of the virus. Another study showed that the bivalent vaccine also protects against severe disease.
Wastewater surveillance shows that those variants, XBB and XBB.1.5, make up about 25% of the virus circulating in San Diego County. The County Health and Human Services Agency continues to urge people to get vaccinated with the booster to protect themselves—particularly people who are 65 years of age and older. Those people are the group most at risk of suffering serious complications, including death, from the COVID-19 virus.
“COVID-19 virus variants are still widespread in our county and it’s important that people protect themselves by getting vaccinated if they haven’t been already,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “While cases, hospitalizations and deaths are decreasing, these events are still occurring in San Diego County. These new studies reinforce the data that bivalent boosters, can protect you, your family and friends from getting seriously ill or dying.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  and California Department of Public Health a recommend a bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older. Previous CDC studies have reported that people who have not been vaccinated run much higher risks of dying from COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated.
To date, more than 540,000 San Diegans have gotten vaccinated with the bivalent COVID-19 booster since it became available here in September 2022. The County Health and Human Services Agency reports that 80.5% of San Diegans—nearly 2.7 million people—got their primary COVID-19 vaccinations.
COVID-19 vaccines, including bivalent boosters, and flu vaccines are widely available at local medical providers and pharmacies. The County continues to offer vaccinations throughout the region at its vaccination sites. Check online for the days and hours sites will be open.
Preventive Measures   
In addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often.
Staying away from sick people.
Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
Conducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County of San Diego COVID-19 testing webpage.

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress  

More than 2.69 million or 80.5% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Bivalent boosters administered: 556,351 or 22.3% of 2,498,111 eligible San Diegans.

The County of San Diego Department of Homeless Solutions and Equitable Communities is launching a pilot program to provide 222 seniors at risk of experiencing homelessness a rental subsidy. 
This program was approved by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors last September. Eligible adults over 55 years old would be provided $500 a month for 18 months to help them stabilize. Assistance payments are anticipated to begin this spring. 
San Diego’s 55 years or older population is expected to balloon to more than 1.1 million people by 2030. 
“Older adults, in particular people on fixed incomes, are struggling with rising rents and represent a growing part of our homeless population,” said Barbara Jiménez, Community Operations Officer who oversees the Department of Homeless Solutions & Equitable Communities. “This pilot program will help people remain in their homes while also offering light case management services to connect participants to supportive services.” 
According to the 2022 We All Count Point-in-Time Count, 25 percent of people who were unsheltered were 55 years and older. 
Eligible applicants must: 

Have a household income at or below 50 percent of the Area Median Income.  
Be using more than half of their income toward housing. 
Have their name on the lease or rental agreement. 
Have a landlord willing to participate in the program. 
Not be receiving any other rental subsidies.  
Sign consent forms to participate in the program.  

Pilot program participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be selected at random. 
To apply for this rental subsidy, email your full name and contact information to HSEC-OHS.HHSA@sdcounty.ca.gov or call 619-980-4168. Application assistance and translation services will be provided.

1253,"COVID-19 Cases Decline, County Urges People to Get  Vaccinated, Boosted","COVID-19 cases are currently decreasing across San Diego County, but County health officials continue to urge people to get the primary vaccine series and the bivalent boosters because coronavirus is still widespread, and vaccinations protect against serious illness and death.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-cases-decline-county-urges-people-to-get-vaccinated-boosted/,2023-02-02T17:52:06-08:00,"
COVID-19 cases are currently decreasing across San Diego County, but County health officials continue to urge people to get the primary vaccine series and the bivalent boosters. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is still widespread in the community, and vaccinations protect against serious illness, and even death.
New studies continue to report the bivalent COVID-19 boosters add protection against new COVID-19 variants that now make up about 40% of new cases in the U.S. and protect against COVID-19 causing hospitalizations and deaths.
Both COVID-19 vaccinations and treatment remain widely available throughout San Diego County. COVID-19 primary series vaccines, bivalent boosters, and flu vaccines are available at local pharmacies, medical providers’ offices, and County vaccination sites. People can check online for the days and hours sites are open.
“It is encouraging that COVID-19 cases appear to be declining, but it remains important that people continue to protect themselves by getting vaccinated if they haven’t already done so,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “Cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are still occurring in San Diego County. Studies show COVID-19 vaccines and bivalent boosters can protect you, your family and friends from getting seriously ill. So please, get vaccinated and boosted if you haven’t.”
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) recommend a bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older. Previous CDC studies have reported that people who have not been vaccinated run much higher risks of dying from COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated.
COVID-19 Prevention, Treatment
County public health officials notified medical providers last week that Evusheld, a COVID-19 prevention drug, is no longer available for emergency use. That was because the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it was not effective against new COVID-19 variants. However, Paxlovid, which is effective, is still widely available. Information about treatment can be found on the County’s COVID-19 treatment webpage.
Preventive Measures   
In addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often.
Staying away from sick people.
Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
Conducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County’s COVID-19 testing webpage.

1254,First Local Detection of Hantavirus in 2023,A deer mouse collected from an open nature area in Campo during routine monitoring has tested positive for the potentially deadly hantavirus.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/first-local-detection-of-hantavirus-in-2023/,2023-02-03T16:22:14-08:00,"
A deer mouse collected from an open nature area in Campo during routine monitoring has tested positive for the potentially deadly hantavirus.
Finding hantavirus in wild rodents is not uncommon in San Diego County, there were a total of 11 cases in 2022. However, people rarely come into direct contact with infected animals because wild rodents naturally avoid humans.
While exposure to hantavirus is rare, people should be careful around wild rodents as there is no cure or vaccine for hantavirus.
Symptoms of hantavirus usually develop between 1-8 weeks after exposure and include:

Severe muscle aches
Chills, fever or fatigue
Headache or dizziness
Nausea, vomiting or stomach pain
Difficulty breathing

If you think that you may have been exposed to hantavirus, seek medical attention immediately.
Preventing Infection 
People can be exposed to hantavirus when wild rodents invade their living area. Infected rodents shed the virus in their urine, poop and saliva. Once the matter dries, it can be stirred into the air where people could inhale the virus.
If people find wild rodents, nests or signs of them in their living spaces, they should always use “wet cleaning” methods — using bleach or other disinfectants, rubber gloves and bags. They should NOT sweep or vacuum, which could stir hantavirus into the air where it could be inhaled.
Avoid Exposure to Hantavirus

Seal up all external holes in homes, garages, and sheds larger than a dime to keep rodents from getting in.
Eliminate rodent infestations immediately.
Avoid rodent-infested areas and do not stir up dust or materials that may be contaminated with rodent poop and urine.
Clean up rodent poop and urine using the “wet cleaning” methods described below.

“Wet-cleaning” Methods

Do not sweep or vacuum infested areas.
Ventilate the affected area by opening doors and windows for at least 30 minutes before starting to clean.
Use rubber gloves. Spray a 10 percent bleach solution or other disinfectants onto dead rodents, rodent poop, nests, contaminated traps and surrounding areas, thenlet the disinfectant stand for at least 15 minutes before cleaning.
Clean with a sponge or a mop that has been soaked in disinfectant.
Place disinfected rodents and debris into two plastic bags, seal them and discard them in the trash.
Wash gloves in a bleach solution, then soap and water, and dispose of them using the same double-bag method.
Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water.

For more information, contact the County Department of Environmental Health and Quality (DEHQ) at (858) 694-2888 or visit the DEHQ hantavirus web page.

1256,State Declares Citrus Quarantine in Rancho Bernardo,The California Department of Food and Agriculture has declared a new citrus quarantine in a 95 square-mile area of Rancho Bernardo after detecting a potentially threatening citrus tree disease during routine inspections.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/state-declares-citrus-quarantine-in-rancho-bernardo/,2023-02-07T16:00:26-08:00,"
The California Department of Food and Agriculture has declared a new citrus quarantine in a 95 square-mile area of Rancho Bernardo after detecting a potentially threatening citrus tree disease during routine inspections.
The bacterial disease, known as Huanglongbing (HLB), is a major threat to San Diego’s $115 million annual citrus crop. Trees infected with HLB can produce mishappen, bitter fruit and the disease can eventually kill the tree.
This new quarantine comes after HLB was found in a residential lime tree in the area and is in addition to the existing HLB quarantine in the city of Oceanside. It covers the area bordered on the north by the intersection of I-15 and Auto Park Way; to the south by Poway Road; to the west by Via De Las Flores; and to the east by Lake Ramona.  The maps for this HLB quarantine are available here.
The intent of the quarantine is to protect the region’s food supply and support the agricultural economy and environmental sustainability by restricting people and businesses from moving citrus nursery stock, plant parts and fruit outside the quarantine boundaries and off their properties.  The only exception is for agricultural businesses that must adhere to specific requirements for treatment, cleaning, and packing commercial fruit prior to movement.
HLB is not harmful to people or animals but could be devastating to the county’s citrus industry. The disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllids, tiny insects that can carry the bacterium when they feed on citrus trees.
“Unfortunately, Huanglongbing is fatal to citrus,” said San Diego Agricultural Commissioner Ha Dang. “Our goal is to prevent this disease from spreading any further. By working together, we can all protect our food supply, local agriculture, and environment from this devasting disease.”
The County Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures is partnering with state and federal regulators to limit the impact on the public and help prevent the spread of the disease. County and state officials will work with residents in the affected area to arrange for treatment of citrus trees as a protective measure against the disease.
County officials are also proactively notifying local citrus growers, plant nurseries and other related businesses.
Samples from trees on the affected property and the surrounding area are undergoing tests for HLB. If HLB is detected in additional citrus trees in the quarantine area, state agricultural officials will follow up with treatment and removal of the infected trees.
Residents in the quarantine area are urged to take the following steps:

Do not move citrus plants, leaves or foliage into or out of the quarantine area.
Cooperate with agricultural officials who are inspecting trees, taking samples and treating for the pest.
Consider removing your citrus tree if you no longer need it.
Buy citrus trees only from reputable local nurseries.
Report citrus trees that seem to be sick or dying by contacting the San Diego Department of Agriculture, Weights and Measures at (760) 752-4700 or visit sdcawm.org.
Residents can also call CDFA’s toll free Pest Hotline at (800) 491-1899 or visit cdfa.ca.gov/plant/acp.

1257,County’s COVID-19 Emergency Declarations to End; Response Continues,"The County’s Board of Supervisors accepted a COVID-19 update Tuesday stating the County’s nearly 3-year-old coronavirus local emergency and local health emergency will end Feb. 28, matching the end of the state of California’s previously announced plan.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/countys-covid-19-emergency-declarations-to-end-response-continues/,2023-02-07T17:06:24-08:00,"
The County’s Board of Supervisors accepted a COVID-19 update Tuesday stating the County’s nearly 3-year-old coronavirus local emergency and local health emergency will end Feb. 28, matching the ending date of the state of California’s previously announced plan.
The update also stated the County will continue to provide all the services needed to respond to the ongoing pandemic, including surveillance, testing, tracing, treatment, vaccinations and public engagement.
The Board first ratified the County’s proclamation of a local emergency and declaration of the local health emergency on Feb. 19, 2020, becoming just the second county in California to declare a local emergency for the then-emerging coronavirus pandemic.
Those emergency responses allowed the County to respond more effectively to the pandemic; seek and use mutual aid; put itself in place to seek financial reimbursement to handle COVID-19; and make sure County health professionals, and other health agencies had the tools they needed to respond, including standing up equitable and highly accessible testing and vaccination programs.
Like the rest of the world, COVID-19 impacted San Diego County. Over the past three years, more than 976,000 San Diegans have laboratory confirmed positive tests for COVID-19, more than 38,500 have been hospitalized and 5,728 died.
County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., noted the County’s focus on mass testing, treatment, vaccinations and investigation and tracing proved positive and saved people from dying.
“Sadly, while lives have been lost, combined community efforts, including enhanced surveillance, accessible and equitable testing and vaccination strategies, and provision of appropriate PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), have saved lives,” Wooten said. “Early and thorough response from the County of San Diego resulted in an estimated 3,307 lives saved, from Feb. 14, 2020, through Nov. 13, 2021, according to an analysis by the County’s Community Health Statistics Unit.”
County Health and Human Services Agency Director Nick Macchione thanked current and former County supervisors, County Chief Administrative Officer Helen Robbins-Meyer, County employees, nurses, physicians, therapists, local hospitals, healthcare facilities, CAL FIRE, first responders, the County’s 18 cities, community partners, community-based organizations, the public and the media for their part in addressing a “generational pandemic.”
“What we accomplished collectively is regarded as one of the best responses in the nation, with recognition from the federal government, the governor and the state, and many other leaders.” Macchione said, “We set the bar for others to follow.”
The County’s comprehensive local response to protect the public’s health with an equity focus featured numerous actions, including:

Rapidly deploying widespread testing and mass vaccinations
Keeping people informed across sectors from education to faith based and through open and frequent media communications
Employing “promotoras”—community health workers
Procuring outreach contracts with various and ethnic community organizations
Working with long-term care facilities that housed people at high risk of the virus
Surveilling wastewater to detect and gauge virus levels

Since the start of the pandemic, the County has invested more than $1 billion to fight coronavirus, not only through health actions, but also by providing food, housing and child-care assistance, as well as stimulus to help businesses and people hurt by COVID-19. Nearly 2.7 million San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines and more than 560,000 have received a bivalent booster vaccine.
More information about the County’s ongoing response to COVID-19 is available online on the County COVID-19 website.

1258,"VIDEO: Love Your Heart Week of Action Promotes Heart Health with Events, Information & More",This year Love Your Heart events and no-cost blood pressure screenings will be available over the course of several days in locations throughout the county and Mexico.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/love-your-heart-week-of-action-promotes-heart-health-with-events-information-more/,2023-02-09T09:55:01-08:00,"
This year Love Your Heart events and no-cost blood pressure screenings will be available over the course of several days in locations throughout the county and Mexico.
Knowing your blood pressure numbers is a vital first step toward heart health. Heart diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and the second leading cause of death in San Diego County. In 2021, nearly 5,000 people died in San Diego County from heart diseases.
This year the Love Your Heart Week of Action runs Feb. 11 through Feb. 19 and will include two community events – one in Chula Vista and another in Ramona – along with more than 300 locations across San Diego County and Mexico where you can get your blood pressure checked for free. Check your nearest location now.
“We all have a responsibility to keep ourselves and our families healthy,” said Nora Vargas, Chairwoman, San Diego County Board of Supervisors. “Through this program our county is expanding access to healthcare beyond our borders and making it easy to get checked on your way to work or home from the store. Take charge of your health and keep your heart healthy, a 5-minute check can save your life! – ¡Cinco minutos pueden salvar tu vida!” 
Launched 12 years ago, the Love Your Heart used the period around Valentine’s Day to encourage a deeper understanding of the importance of heart health. This year it continues as an expanded week of action to combat one of the more preventable causes of death: heart disease.  
“I’m proud to say over the past 12 years we have been able to help thousands of people become aware of their blood pressure, and in the process save lives when they went to their doctor for follow up care,” Macchione said. “Our successes happened because of the diligent work by the county and through our incredible partners, but more needs to be done and we continue to urge everyone to become more heart healthy and aware.”   
Research showed three behaviors to be the most impactful on your health: 

 Poor Diet
 Physical inactivity
 Tobacco use

Those behaviors contribute to four chronic diseases: 

 Cancer
 Heart disease and stroke
 Type 2 Diabetes
 Lung diseases (like asthma)

Combined, those four diseases cause more than half of all deaths worldwide. 
Among people in San Diego County, heart disease remains the second leading cause of death, equating to nearly 5,000 loved ones lost in 2021.  
“While the statistics may seem grim, efforts like Love Your Heart have driven a 12 percent reduction in the percentage of deaths associated with preventable death threats from 2007 to 2019,” Dr. Ankita Kadakia, Deputy Public Health Officer. “By making small lifestyle changes and knowing your blood pressure numbers you can take control of your health.”  
Heart health is top of mind for many Americans after NFL player Damar Hamlin collapsed during the Buffalo Bills game last month. That is why San Diego County and Live Well partners are also impressing the importance of learning CPR and knowing where AEDs are around your workplace and in other public spaces. 
For people interested in learning about CPR, the Community Emergency Response Team will demonstrate hands-only CPR at the Ramona Love Your Heart fair.  
The two community events will bring Live Well partners together to provide blood pressure screenings, flu vaccines, Narcan distribution and other resources to educate our neighbors and empower them to take control of their health.

The County looked into the California Healthy Places Index when planning the location of community events and screening sites to focus on areas with an above-average recorded incidence of high blood pressure. 
Knowing your numbers and making small changes to your daily life, including diet and exercise, important in the prevention of heart disease, cardiac arrest, and stroke. 
Last year’s Love Your Heart campaign reached more than 7.5 million people, through the combined mediums of print, radio, billboard, transit and social media. It gave community partners more than 6,000 blood pressure monitors to give to underserved residents and supplied Love Your Heart educational packets at all COVID-19 testing sites. The campaign also reached more than 500 people through community events including the Refugee & Newcomer Fair.

1259,"County Reminds People to get Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccinations, Boosters","As the County plans to end its COVID-19 emergencies this month, County public health officials remind the public the response to the ongoing pandemic continues, and that people should also continue to protect themselves by getting up to date with COVID-19 vaccinations.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-reminds-people-to-get-up-to-date-with-covid-19-vaccinations-boosters/,2023-02-09T17:23:52-08:00,"
As the County of San Diego plans to end its COVID-19 emergencies this month, County public health officials remind the public they will continue to respond to the ongoing pandemic.
To that end, they continue to urge people to protect themselves and get up to date with their COVID-19 vaccinations, including getting a bivalent booster if they haven’t already.
“It remains extremely important for people to protect themselves, their families and their friends from COVID-19,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “The coronavirus is still circulating in our community and can be dangerous and even fatal for some who contract it. The best way to prevent getting seriously ill is to get current with your COVID-19 vaccinations, including your bivalent booster.”
The County’s Board of Supervisors accepted a COVID-19 update this week stating the County’s nearly 3-year-old coronavirus local and health emergencies will end Feb. 28, matching the state of California’s ending date.
The update also stated the County will continue to provide all the services needed to protect the public and respond to the continuing pandemic including surveillance, testing, tracing, treatment, vaccinations and public engagement.
COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are currently declining in San Diego County.
Both COVID-19 vaccinations and treatment remain widely available throughout San Diego County. COVID-19 primary series vaccines and bivalent boosters, as well as flu vaccines are available at local pharmacies, medical providers’ offices, and County vaccination sites. People can check online for the days and hours sites are open.
New studies continue to report the bivalent COVID-19 boosters add protection against new COVID-19 variants that make up most new cases in the San Diego County, and they protect against COVID-19 causing hospitalizations and deaths. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) recommend a bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older. Previous CDC studies have reported that people who have not been vaccinated run much higher risks of dying from COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated.
Preventive Measures   
In addition to vaccination and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19, as well as seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often.
Staying away from sick people.
Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
Conducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County’s COVID-19 testing webpage.

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress 

More than 2.69 million or 80.6% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Bivalent boosters administered: 567,647 or 22.6% of 2,513,342 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators.
COVID-19 Data 
For the week ending Feb. 4, 2023, the report shows:

1,714 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days. The region’s total is now 978,824.
The 1,714 cases reported in the past week were lower compared to the 1,870 infections identified the previous week.

1260,County to Fund Millions Toward Affordable Housing,"On Feb 7, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved recommendations that will allow the County’s Housing and Community Development Services (HCDS) to leverage millions of dollars in state funding for the development and preservation of affordable housing.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-to-fund-millions-toward-affordable-housing/,2023-02-10T14:23:05-08:00,"
On Feb 7, the San Diego County Board of Supervisors unanimously approved recommendations that will allow the County’s Housing and Community Development Services (HCDS) to leverage millions of dollars in state funding for the development and preservation of affordable housing.
The action came after the board announced last October its goal to produce 10,000 units by 2030. The effort is part of the County’s framework for ending homelessness through permanent housing and support targeted at the root cause and prevention.
“This is a huge step forward to advocate for San Diegans in need of safe affordable housing,” David Estrella, Director of County HCDS said. “It will allow us to reach our vulnerable neighbors and provide equitable housing opportunities.”
In 2022, the County provided financial support for new affordable housing units that will serve 1,151 people, a group that includes seniors, families, veterans, and those experiencing homelessness.
HCDS also received Board approval to apply for new and existing state funding through three state housing programs:

Permanent Local Housing Allocation Program
Prohousing Incentive Pilot Program
CalHome Program

The Permanent Local Housing Allocation Program increases the supply of low-income housing and housing to assist those at risk of or experiencing homelessness, while the Prohousing Incentive Pilot Program helps create and preserve affordable housing. The CalHome Program provides support for first-time homebuyers through down payment and closing cost assistance.
The Board also provided $3.3 million to help build Kettner Crossings. The $45 million development at the corner of Cedar Street and Kettner Boulevard will include 65 units for low-income seniors. It is being built on surplus County property and expected to break ground later this year.
HCDS helps more than 35,500 people live in safe affordable housing. As part of that housing, the department maintains nearly 7,600 affordable units in 109 developments throughout the County. More than 16,700 people call those units home.

Valentine’s Day is not just about romantic love, it’s also about sharing affection and showing how you care for others. So, who’s to say your sweetheart can’t be furry?
The County Department of Animal Services is playing matchmaker this week. As part of a Sweetheart Special, starting on Valentine’s Day through Feb. 19, all animals are just $14 to adopt.
There is someone for everyone. For those of you who like to be the center of someone’s universe and don’t mind bad breath, try a dog. Maybe you prefer to earn your love, try a cat. If you like the intellectual type, try a pig — they’re smarter than dogs  You like slow walks on aquarium beaches, how about a red-eared slider turtle? Recently gone vegetarian? Share a nibble on a carrot with one of our bunnies.
All animals will be spayed or neutered, have vaccinations, a microchip and a one-year license for dogs in the service area.
The first step to finding a new best friend is browsing all the lovable animals from cats to dogs to chickens and pigs available now on the  Adoptions page.  Animal Services staff recommend picking out a second and third choice too, just in case your first choice is already chosen by another person.
Walk-in hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at both the South Shelter, 5821 Sweetwater Road in Bonita, or the North Shelter, 2481 Palomar Airport Road in Carlsbad.
Fill out an application online to print or pick one up at the shelter. Applications can also be emailed but it is quicker to go in person.
If you cannot adopt, consider fostering or volunteering.

Lots of wind, but lots of love in the air too as Valentine’s Day couples lined up to say “I do” at weddings throughout the County Tuesday.
Marriage ceremonies were held at all four of the County Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk’s offices. Reservations were required except at the County Administration Center where couples could walk-in for an impromptu wedding ceremony.
Some couples didn’t let the cold winds stop them from an outdoor wedding. Others opted to stay inside to tie the knot.
Valentine’s Day is one of the most sought-after wedding days of the year for the Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk’s office. The busiest day took place on Friday, Feb. 14, 2014, when the office issued 266 licenses and performed 242 ceremonies: 508 combined.
On Tuesday, the office issued at least 119 marriage licenses and conducted 82 weddings.
On average, the office sells nearly 25,000 marriage licenses and performs more than 11,000 weddings a year. Nearly half of customers who buy a marriage license also hold their wedding ceremonies at the Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk’s office.

1263,Active Tuberculosis Reported in Transit Rider,"Passengers using the Metropolitan Transit System Trolley system may have been exposed to tuberculosis, the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency announced today.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/active-tuberculosis-reported-in-transit-rider-2/,2023-02-16T10:02:02-08:00,"
Passengers using the Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) Trolley system may have been exposed to tuberculosis (TB), the County of San Diego Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) announced today.
HHSA Public Health Services Department and MTS officials are working in close collaboration to notify riders who used the Trolley’s Blue and Orange lines between June 31, 2022 to December 31, 2022 that they were potentially exposed and are at risk for infection:

Trolley Blue Line from San Ysidro to 12th & Imperial Transit Center Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6:30 a.m.
Trolley Orange Line from 12th & Imperial to El Cajon Monday through Friday from 6:30 to 7 a.m.
Trolley Orange Line from El Cajon to 12th & Imperial Monday through Friday roughly between 5:45 p.m. and 6:15 p.m.
Trolley Blue Line from 12th & Imperial to San Ysidro Transit Center Monday through Friday roughly between 6:15 p.m. and 7:45 p.m.

People with active tuberculosis are often unaware they have the disease and may be contagious for several months before being diagnosed. Once the County is made aware, typically through a test result reported by a medical provider, communicable disease investigators conduct extensive interviews with the patient to determine the length of time they were infected and the locations of potential exposure. This is done to best inform people who may have been exposed and the action they should take.
Potentially affected passengers are advised to consult with their medical provider or contact the San Diego County TB Program.
Tuberculosis is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person to person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. The bacteria are spread when someone sick with TB coughs, speaks, sings or breathes. People with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB should get tested.
Two other MTS riders with TB were reported in August and September 2022. At this time HHSA does not have any evidence directly linking the rider most recently diagnosed with TB to the other MTS riders. Additional lab testing will be used to determine if there may be linkages between these riders.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Ankita Kadakia, M.D., County Deputy Public Health Officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. This is called latent TB infection. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill in the future, sometimes even years later, if their latent TB infection is not treated. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.”
Effective treatments are available to cure people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for individuals with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune compromised to see their medical provider to rule out active tuberculosis and to discuss treatment.
People who test positive for TB but who don’t have symptoms of active TB should get a chest x-ray and talk to a medical provider, as they most likely have a latent TB infection.  People in this situation are infected with TB, but the infection is essentially dormant or “sleeping.” Taking medicines for latent TB infection can cure the infection and keep these people from getting sick.
Individuals who would like more information on this potential exposure are asked to call the County TB Control Program at (619) 692-8621.
The number of people diagnosed with active TB in San Diego County has decreased since the early 1990s and has stabilized in recent years. There were 192 in 2020 and 201 people reported with active disease in 2021. Preliminary data shows 208 people were reported to have active TB disease in 2022.
An estimated 175,000 people in San Diego County have latent TB infection and are at risk for developing active TB without preventive treatment. HHSA encourages all San Diegans to know their own risk for TB infection. The County of San Diego Tuberculosis Control Program’s Risk Assessment tool is available on their website at: TB Risk Assessment (sandiegocounty.gov)

1265,"COVID-19 Cases Rise, County Urges People to Get Vaccinated, Boosted","COVID-19 cases are slightly rising in San Diego County, prompting County health officials to continue calls for people to complete their vaccination series and get bivalent boosters if they haven’t already.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/covid-19-cases-rise-county-urges-people-to-get-vaccinated-boosted/,2023-02-16T16:40:26-08:00,"
COVID-19 cases are slightly rising in San Diego County, prompting County health officials to continue calls for people to complete their vaccination series and get bivalent boosters if they haven’t already.
“The best way for people to protect themselves, their loved ones and friends from possibly getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19 continues to be getting up to date with your vaccinations and get a bivalent booster,” said County Deputy Public Health Officer, Dr. Cameron Kaiser, M.D., M.P.H. “Even though COVID-19 cases are far below historic highs, the virus is still widespread. And it remains a potentially deadly threat for many people.”
Studies continue to report the bivalent COVID-19 boosters add protection against new COVID-19 variants that make up most new cases in the San Diego County, and they protect against COVID-19 causing hospitalizations and deaths.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and California Department of Public Health (CDPH) recommend a bivalent booster for everyone six months of age and older. Previous CDC studies have reported that people who have not been vaccinated run much higher risks of dying from COVID-19 than those who have been vaccinated.
Both COVID-19 vaccinations and treatment remain widely available throughout San Diego County. COVID-19 primary series vaccines and bivalent boosters, as well as flu vaccines, are available at local pharmacies, medical providers’ offices, and County vaccination sites. People can check online for the days and hours sites are open.
Preventive Measures   
In addition to getting vaccinations and staying home when ill, San Diegans can take other precautions to protect themselves against COVID-19 and other seasonal illnesses like the flu. These measures include:

Cleaning hands thoroughly and often.
Staying away from sick people.
Wearing a facial covering, especially in crowded indoor settings.
Regularly cleaning commonly touched surfaces.
Conducting home testing when exposed or when ill. The federal government is providing free at-home COVID-19 tests available again through the winter for a limited time. Households can order one pack of four free tests through the U.S. Postal Service.  For more information about testing, go to the County’s COVID-19 testing webpage.

COVID-19 Vaccination Progress 

More than 2.69 million or 80.6% of San Diegans have received the primary series of one of the approved COVID-19 vaccines.
Bivalent boosters administered: 572,085 or 22.8% of 2,514,110 eligible San Diegans.
More vaccination information can be found at coronavirus-sd.com/vaccine.

The County Health and Human Services Agency now publishes the Respiratory Virus Surveillance Report weekly. The report is published each Thursday and tracks key respiratory illness indicators.
COVID-19 Data 
For the week ending Feb. 11, 2023, the report shows:

1,916 COVID-19 cases were reported to the County in the past seven days. The region’s total is now 981,076.

1267,County-Funded Developments Benefit From New State Affordable Housing Grants ,Four affordable housing developments with $29 million in County funding have secured an additional $24.5 million through California’s Multifamily Finance Super Notice of Funding Availability program. ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-funded-developments-benefit-from-new-state-affordable-housing-grants/,2023-02-17T13:18:14-08:00,"
Four affordable housing developments with $29 million in County funding have secured an additional $24.5 million through California’s Multifamily Finance Super Notice of Funding Availability program. 
The $24.5 million in new funds were announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom as part of more than $825 million in grants to accelerate affordable housing production across the state. 
“This is such an exciting opportunity to expand the work we have already been doing to support more of our vulnerable San Diego neighbors and families,” said David Estrella, Director of County Housing and Community Development Services. “We continue to focus on building opportunity for the next generation and fulfilling the Board of Supervisor’s goal to produce 10,000 units by 2030.” 
The four County-funded developments in the planning stages that are supported through the program will result in 359 units of affordable housing. The developments are Union Tower, The Iris at San Ysidro, Serenade on 43rd, and Rancho Bernardo Transit Village.  

Union Tower will be a 94-unit building serving low-income families in National City. It was awarded $11.5 million through the new program. 



The Iris at San Ysidro will be a 100-unit development serving people experiencing homelessness with serious mental illness and low-income families. It was awarded an additional $5 million. 



Serenade on 43rd will provide 65 units for people experiencing homelessness, with and without a serious mental illness. This development was awarded another $3.7 million through the new program. 



Rancho Bernardo Transit Village will provide 100 units for low-income families. It received an additional $4.4 million. 


San Diego County Housing and Community Development Services helps more than 35,500 people live in safe affordable housing. As part of that housing, the department maintains nearly 7,600 affordable units in 109 developments throughout the County. More than 16,700 people call those units home. Currently, HCDS is helping fund 14 developments under construction, totaling 1,084 units, and 21 developments on the horizon, totaling 2,060 units. 
These and other efforts are part of the County’s ongoing response to the region’s housing affordability crisis. Efforts are underway to create a roadmap, or Housing Blueprint, to guide our ongoing response. Community input has been vital to the County’s efforts to address the crisis to date and is encouraged to help inform final recommendations for the Blueprint’s goals and objectives and be presented to the Board of Supervisors.

1268,Precautions to Stay Safe During Cold Winter Storm System,"Rain, strong winds and cold temperatures predicted to bring significant snow to local mountains as low as 2,000 feet began Tuesday evening and are forecast to continue through Saturday. The winds will additionally bring high surf to beaches, so everyone should take precautions if on the water.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/precautions-to-stay-safe-during-cold-winter-storm-system/,2023-02-22T07:51:45-08:00,"
Rain, strong winds and cold temperatures predicted to bring significant snow to local mountains as low as 2,000 feet began Tuesday evening and are forecast to continue through Saturday. The winds will additionally bring high surf to beaches, so everyone should take precautions if on the water.
County Emergency Services and Public Works road crews recommend everyone stay alert and take precautions at home and on the roads during the atmospheric river event.
The National Weather Service winter storm systems forecast is available and can be checked for updates.
Damaging winds are expected through the week and could result in tree damage or falling trees or limbs. Driving, particularly if you are driving a high-profile vehicle, is predicted to be hazardous at times.
Avoid driving in heavy rain conditions but if the trip is necessary:

Slow down to avoid getting into an accident. Remember, it takes longer to stop when roads are wet. Allow yourself at least an extra 15 minutes or so to arrive at your destination to adjust for slower traffic.
Turn on your headlights to see better and make it easier for other drivers to see you. It’s the law.
Try to drive toward the middle lanes as water tends to gather in outside lanes.
Defog your windows for better visibility. Rain can cause windows to fog up. Along the same lines, check your windshield wipers preferably before it rains again and replace them as needed.
Avoid driving through deep water because it can affect your brakes. If you cannot avoid it, test your brakes afterward to make sure they’ve dried out and are working properly.
Give the cars in front of you extra distance. The spray from their vehicles — particularly from larger trucks and buses — can hamper your vision. And giving extra space to the guy in front of you also gives you more time to brake or adjust if you need to.
Keep calm, don’t oversteer or stomp on the brakes if you start to hydroplane or skid when your tires lose traction with the wet road. The Department of Motor Vehicles says keep the steering wheel straight and take your foot off the accelerator so your vehicle can slow down slowly.
Turn around, don’t drown. In heavy rains, never drive through a flooded roadway if you cannot see the pavement. Even a few inches of water running at the right velocity can sweep a car, and even a truck, and its occupants off the roadway and downstream. The same tip applies to trying to walk or swim across a flooded roadway.
Stay focused. Remember, it’s illegal, and dangerous, to try to text or use a hand-held cell phone when you’re driving.
Slow down for the cone zone if you see highway or road workers ahead or to your side. Watch out for DPW crews and equipment.
If driving in the snow, keep up with the weather reports to see if tire chains are required. Be aware conditions on the ground can change rapidly. Also keep some extra safety equipment in your car.

Chain controls, road condition updates, and other safety advisories are posted on DPW’s Facebook and Twitter sites.
The San Diego County Office of Emergency Services has flood ready information to help you prepare and learn more about flood risks, the most common natural disaster.

The National Weather Service is forecasting a major winter storm for San Diego County. A Winter Storm Warning was issued through Saturday for San Diego County Mountains.
Meteorologist Alex Tardy says cold temperatures and precipitation from an atmospheric river could “set the stage for unprecedented snowfall.”  Tardy expects freezing temperatures at 1,500 to 2,000 feet and says, “This is major snowfall.  It’s not too often that we talk about one to three feet of snow above four thousand feet.”
Visit AlertSanDiego.org for more information on the storm and to register for AlertSanDiego, the regions emergency mass notification system.
Make sure you are prepared if you need to travel through San Diego’s mountains.

Be weather wise and know the weather forecast during your travel.
Limit travel during and after a winter storm.
Keep gas tanks full and phones charged and keep an emergency preparedness kit with you.
Keep jumper cables, blankets and other winter supplies in your vehicle.

Snow chains may be required on certain roads and highways.  Chain controls, road condition updates and other safety advisories about County-maintained roads are posted on the Department of Public Works Facebook and Twitter sites.

With the County’s 3-year-long COVID-19 local emergency proclamation and local health emergency declarations, and weekly County News Center updates coming to an end, the County’s Public Health Officer reiterated a continuing message this week.
The County response to the ongoing pandemic—testing, treating and vaccinating—will continue. The virus is still circulating. And people should continue to protect themselves by getting up to date with vaccinations, including getting a bivalent booster if they haven’t yet.
“Our declaration of a local health emergency and local emergency proclamation will end Feb. 28, matching the end of the state’s declarations,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “But make no mistake, this is not the time to let your guard down. The virus is still circulating throughout the community. People are still being hospitalized and dying. So protect yourself, your family and friends. We strongly urge people to get current with their COVID-19 vaccinations, including the bivalent booster.”
In addition to the Feb. 28 end of the COVID-19 local and health emergencies, County officials said the Feb. 23 County News Center article would be the last regular update of its kind.
The County will continue to publish COVID-19 articles and social media posts when it has new information to share with the public. The County’s COVID-19 web pages will continue to be updated weekly. And people can subscribe to the County’s Respiratory Virus Surveillance report to get continued weekly COVID-19 data reporting.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, the County has published more than 570 County News Center stories and videos that registered more than 27.2 million views, providing San Diegans with the most up-to-date information about COVID-19, testing, treatments and vaccinations.
The County’s response to the pandemic will continue in strength, providing the services needed to protect the public including surveillance, testing, tracing, treatment, vaccinations and public engagement.
Both COVID-19 vaccinations and treatment remain widely available throughout San Diego County.

1271,"It’s Preteen Vaccine Week, Protect Your Children","Sometimes the things you can’t see pose the biggest threats to our children—serious and sometimes deadly infections like diptheria and meningococcal disease, viruses like the flu and COVID-19, and even cancers. Fortunately, there are vaccinations to help parents and protect kids from those threats!",https://www.countynewscenter.com/its-preteen-vaccine-week-protect-your-children/,2023-02-27T10:16:08-08:00,"
Sometimes the things you can’t see pose the biggest threats to our children—serious and sometimes deadly infections like diptheria and meningococcal disease, viruses like the flu and COVID-19, and even cancers.
Fortunately, there are vaccinations to help parents and protect kids from those threats!
Feb. 26 through March 4 is California’s “Preteen Vaccine Week.” And County public health officials are reminding parents that they should call their children’s healthcare providers to get Tdap, chickenpox, human papillomavirus (HPV), COVID-19 and other vaccinations that can keep their children from getting ill.
“Keeping your children safe from unseen dangers like serious and even deadly illnesses is a lot easier with these vaccines,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “Preteen Vaccine Week is a good reminder for all of us to get our children up to date with these vaccines.”
That message is extra important this year. That’s because the COVID-19 pandemic may have prevented parents and kids over the past few years from keeping current with vaccination schedules for children aged 11 to 12.
There are hundreds of thousands of preteens and adolescents in San Diego County and some have not had all their recommended vaccines. Making sure students have all the required vaccines is part of the countywide Live Well San Diego vision, an effort to improve the health and well-being of residents in the region.
The CDC recommends adolescent children get the following vaccinations to protect them from diseases:
HPV (human papillomavirus)
Boys and girls can begin getting HPV vaccinations at 9-years-old to protect against cancers that can be caused by the virus. The CDC says children ages 11-12 should get two doses six to 12 months apart. Children who start the HPV series on or after 15-years-old need three doses given over six months. HPV vaccine for girls and young women prevents cervical cancer. The vaccine is also recommended for boys to prevent anal cancer and genital warts.
Quadrivalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenACWY and MenB) (Meningococcal disease)
The MenACWY vaccine is recommended for preteens ages 11-12 for protection against bacteria that cause meningococcal disease, a very serious illness which can lead to death in as little as 48 hours. A MenACWY booster is recommended at the age of 16. A MenB vaccine may be recommended for some teens ages 16-18. The bacteria that can cause meningococcal disease can infect the blood and inflame the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord. Of teens who become ill, 10% die and another 15% suffer long-term disability such as loss of limbs, deafness, nervous system problems or brain damage.
Tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (grouped in one vaccine called Tdap)
All students entering seventh grade need proof of a Tdap booster to attend school.  Epidemics of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, occurred in California in 2010 and 2014, and San Diego County saw increased cases in 2017.
Influenza
The flu vaccine is recommended every year for everyone 6 months old and older, including preteens and the whole family. Students who haven’t been immunized in the fall, when it is most helpful, can still benefit from the flu immunization now.
Chickenpox
Chickenpox, or varicella, is a viral infection that causes an itchy rash with small, fluid-filled blisters. While chickenpox is a mild disease for most people, it can be life-threatening for some. Two doses are recommended.
COVID-19 
Two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are recommended for everyone 6 months and older to protect against the serious illness caused by COVD-19. Kids should also get the updated (bivalent) booster dose.
The above vaccines are available at physician offices, community clinics, and many retail pharmacies. People without medical insurance can get vaccinated at one of the six County locations; call 2-1-1 for a location nearest you.
For more information on vaccines, call the HHSA Immunization Branch at (866) 358-2966 or visit www.sdiz.org.

A partnership between Paradise Valley Hospital and the County was celebrated today with an official unveiling of the Crisis Stabilization Unit at the Bayview Campus. This hospital-based CSU provides immediate behavioral health care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for anyone in crisis. Clients can be dropped off or walk up to receive the services and support they need.
The CSU offers crisis intervention, medication management, short-term counseling, care coordination, and connections to ongoing behavioral health and primary care services when applicable. It is a safe, compassionate alternative to emergency rooms and jails.
The CSU has proved to be a critical South County resource for families, friends, law enforcement, first responders and outreach partners. It’s presence has helped decrease the number of patients who end up in Emergency Departments and has shortened the time law enforcement officers wait with clients in crisis who need treatment.
The Bayview CSU opened in April of 2021. COVID restrictions delayed the ribbon cutting, which was celebrated today. The CSU is part of a network of six community-based crisis stabilization units across the county, serving more than 8,500 clients in 2022 alone.
Anyone needing immediate behavioral health assistance should call 9-1-1. Help is also available by calling the County’s Access and Crisis Line at (888) 724-7240 or visiting www.Up2SD.org.

1273,County Establishes New Child and Family Well-Being Department,"The San Diego County Board of Supervisors has approved a reimagined department to support children and families. The new Child and Family Well-Being Department will integrate multiple child and family serving systems, including First 5 San Diego, Child Welfare Services, and other Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) departments, under one umbrella to deliver both prevention and safeguarding services. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-establishes-new-child-and-family-well-being-department/,2023-02-28T15:00:56-08:00,"
The San Diego County Board of Supervisors has approved a reimagined department to support children and families. The new Child and Family Well-Being Department will integrate multiple child and family serving systems, including First 5 San Diego, Child Welfare Services, and other Health and Human Services Agency (HHSA) departments, under one umbrella to deliver both prevention and safeguarding services. 
Adopted unanimously, the new department will allow the County to better address equity and improve outcomes for children and families in a more holistic way by focusing its effort and budget on child and family strengthening programs and community partnerships. 
“Equity and the safety of our community’s children have always been at the core of our efforts,” Kim Giardina, director of Child Welfare Services said. “This transformation allows us the flexibility to respond to the changing landscape and needs of our neighbors to best support them now and many years into the future.” 
This work is designed to reduce the impact of trauma, adverse childhood experiences, and child maltreatment in our community, and to do so with a focus on racial equity and reducing the disproportionate number of African American, Native American, and Hispanic children in foster care. 
The data supports this shift.  
Since 1998, the number of children in CWS care decreased from almost 7,000 to fewer than 2,000, a 71% reduction over 25 years through family-strengthening programs and enhanced engagement. 
The reimagination of services, which has been under development for more than a year, is expected to continue the reduction of children in foster care and reduce the unnecessary child protective actions that have historically harmed and separated families. If further intervention is needed to keep children safe, social workers will work with families to ensure well-being of the children and to place family’s voice at the center of our work.   
The new Child and Family Well-Being Department will consist of the Office of Child and Family Strengthening, which will include First 5 San Diego, coordination of local childcare system, and other prevention and strengthening services, and the Office of Child Safety, which will continue to provide all services currently administered through Child Welfare Services. The Child and Family Strengthening Advisory Board will oversee the overarching organizational change and monitor the department’s work.

1274,Housing and Community Development Services Posting Annual Plan for Public Comment,The County of San Diego’s Housing and Community Development Services (HCDS) is seeking public input on the Annual Plan draft for fiscal year 2023-2024.  ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/housing-and-community-development-services-posting-annual-plan-for-public-comment/,2023-03-01T13:20:58-08:00,"
The County of San Diego’s Housing and Community Development Services (HCDS) is seeking public input on the Annual Plan draft for fiscal year 2023-2024.  
The Annual Plan reviews the housing climate in San Diego and the financial challenges of those served by HCDS. Additionally, the plan identifies specific projects to be funded for the upcoming year through the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG), HOME Investment Partnerships (HOME), Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG), and Housing Opportunities for Persons with HIV/AIDS (HOPWA) federal grant programs. Projects range from community development and housing-related proposals to wraparound services that prioritize the needs of San Diegans. 
The FY 2023-24 Annual Plan will be published March 3, 2023 at SDHCD.org and in newspapers across San Diego communities. It will be available in multiple languages for review by the public ahead of a public hearing on April 4, 2023. This meeting will also provide the opportunity for additional public comment. 
The strategy was informed by community input in a process that started in July 2022. More than 7,000 community members were consulted. 
San Diego County HCDS helps more than 53,800 people live in safe affordable housing. The department maintains more than 6,600 affordable units in 142 developments throughout the County, with more than 14,500 people calling this housing, home. Currently, HCDS is helping fund 16 developments under construction, totaling 1,264 units. In addition, there are 24 developments on the horizon bringing the total of 2,060 units actively under construction or in the works.  
These and other endeavors are part of the County’s ongoing response to the region’s housing affordability crisis. Efforts are underway to create a roadmap, or Housing Blueprint, to guide our ongoing response. Community input has been vital to the County’s efforts to address the crisis to date and is encouraged to help inform final recommendations for the Blueprint’s goals and objectives and be presented to the Board of Supervisors.  
Public input or comments on the draft FY 23-24 Annual Plan can be submitted via email to Community.Development@sdcounty.ca.gov.

1277,County Expands Funding to Engage Fathers and Caregivers,A Behavioral Health Services (BHS) program focused on culturally appropriate programming to strengthen relationships between fathers and their children and bolster fathers’ parenting skills was approved Tuesday by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. This Board approval signals an eight-fold expansion of these services. ,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-expands-funding-to-engage-fathers-and-caregivers/,2023-03-03T11:58:52-08:00,"
A Behavioral Health Services (BHS) program focused on culturally appropriate programming to strengthen relationships between fathers and their children and bolster fathers’ parenting skills was approved Tuesday by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors. This Board approval signals an eight-fold expansion of these services.
“Evidence shows earlier interventions in the lives of young people is the best way to support resilience and wellbeing,” said Dr. Luke Bergmann, director of Behavioral Health Services at the County Health and Human Services Agency. “Parent or caregiver engagement is vital for the mental health development in children.”  
Adverse Childhood Experiences, also known as ACEs, and toxic stress are associated with nine out of the 10 leading causes of death in the country. These poor health outcomes are passed from generation to generation. 
BHS’ Positive Parenting and Father 2 Child programs provide support to families and help break the cycle of trauma. The Positive Parenting Program provides a variety of programming options from in-person to virtual meetings, as well as group or individual skill-building classes for parents, father figures, and caregivers to build positive relationships, improve better management, and reduce stress. 
The Father 2 Child program has provided services to underserved families in the central region since 2012. It produces culturally specific programming for fathers of all ethnicities and seven priority populations, including underserved Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and military families. Activities include curriculum-based group education, counseling, outreach and flexible funds to support employment and recreation opportunities. The program teaches fathering techniques and skills, in addition to increasing awareness around the importance of active and engaged father figures.  
County BHS will build upon these existing programs and expand parenting program services to focus on fathers countywide while providing greater access for underserved communities. A key focus of enhanced programming is to remove barriers to participation like transportation services and childcare. 
BHS focuses on healthcare, family, and school as domains in the Children’s Continuum Strategy to prevent adverse outcomes and health disparities. This expansion falls under the family domain and addresses the importance of fathers, male caregivers, and father figures in the lives of young people. 
Projected annual costs for parenting program services will increase from $250,000 to $2 million. It is part of BHS’ mission to implement prevention and early intervention strategies to strengthen families. 
The County of San Diego’s Behavioral Health Services (BHS) department provides mental health and substance use disorder services to over 111,000 San Diego County residents of all ages. Services are provided through 9 county-operated programs, over 300 contracts, and 800 individual fee-for-service providers. BHS offers services across the lifespan through coordinated systems of care and embraces Live Well San Diego, the County’s over-arching vision for a region that is building better health, living safely, and thriving.

1278,Final Love Your Heart Week of Action Event March 11,"The 12th Annual Love Your Heart Week of Action took place a few weeks ago and early results show that 3,000 San Diegans got blood pressure checks and 4% of those screened needed an urgent visit to their doctor. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/final-love-your-heart-week-of-action-event-march-11/,2023-03-06T11:06:20-08:00,"
The 12th Annual Love Your Heart Week of Action took place a few weeks ago and early results show that more than 3,000 San Diegans got blood pressure checks and more than 100 of those screened needed an urgent visit to their doctor. 
A Love Your Heart community fair held in Chula Vista provided blood pressure screenings, flu vaccines, Narcan distribution and other resources. 
The second community fair in the North County was initially planned for Feb. 25 but was postponed, due to weather. That community fair will take place March 11 from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. at the Ramona Library. There will be free blood pressure screenings, COVID-19 and flu vaccines, food for those in need and other valuable resources. 
In identifying community fair locations, organizers looked to the California Healthy Places Index to identify areas with an above-average recorded incidence of high blood pressure.  
Love Your Heart Week of Action is an annual event hosted by the County of San Diego to share information and resources on the importance of knowing your blood pressure numbers. No-cost screenings are available across San Diego County and Mexico as a part of the Week of Action.  
Knowing your blood pressure numbers is a vital to heart health. Heart diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and the second leading cause of death in San Diego County. In 2021, nearly 5,000 people died in San Diego County from diseases of the heart. 
Making small changes to your daily life, including diet and exercise as well as knowing your numbers are important in the prevention of heart disease, cardiac arrest, and stroke.

1281,"Get in on the Ground Floor, Help Shape County’s Housing Blueprint","County officials want San Diegans to help turn a house―or rather, the County’s draft housing blueprint―into a “home” by filling it with their opinions and advice.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/get-in-on-the-ground-floor-help-shape-countys-housing-blueprint/,2023-03-14T10:39:09-07:00,"
County officials want San Diegans to help turn a house―or rather, the County’s draft housing blueprint―into a “home” by filling it with their opinions and advice.
San Diegans can take a survey on the County’s Engage San Diego County webpage to help shape the County’s housing blueprint.
The blueprint’s overarching goals were adopted from the San Diego Association of Government’s Housing Acceleration Program Strategy. They aim to curb the region’s housing crisis by finding ways to build more housing and more housing around transit hubs; build and retain affordable housing; reduce housing prices overall; and help people afford to stay in their existing homes.
County supervisors approved a draft housing blueprint in December that was created with public input. But the County would like more public engagement as it works toward a completed plan.
The survey on the Enagage San Diego County’s Housing Blueprint site asks people to weigh in on those goals and objectives to help reach them. And to add what they think is missing or should be added to a completed plan.
Home building in San Diego County and many other parts of California haven’t kept up with population growth and housing demand across income levels for decades. That has caused housing costs to skyrocket, making it financially hard, if not impossible, for people to buy, or stay, in homes.
The County has taken numerous actions to add affordable housing in recent years, including announcing a goal last October of working with the City of San Diego to build 10,000 affordable housing units by 2030.
In February, the County secured an additional $24.5 million from the state to boost $29 million already set aside for four affordable housing and related developments that are being planned in National City, San Ysidro and Rancho Bernardo.
In 2022 the County spent millions of dollars and worked with numerous other cities and organizations to build housing to help people with low-incomes, people experiencing homelessness, seniors and veterans. There were affordable housing communities in City Heights, in Carlsbad, Vista and downtown San Diego. In a first of its kind project for the County, it used its own surplus property to begin transforming an empty lot into a site for low-income affordable housing.
Since 2017, the County has leveraged about $1 billion in federal and state funding by investing more than $175 million on 44 affordable housing projects in 24 communities. Many are completed, others are under construction and more are on the way.
The County’s Engage San Diego County webpage was created to make it easier for the public to be involved in the planning process of County projects and initiatives. People can find information about active and upcoming public projects, forums and links to numerous ways to take part and weigh in on those projects.

1286,County Employees Honor Abandoned Veteran at Final Resting Place ,"An average day for Tiffany Tsai usually includes some time spent leafing through case files at her desk in the County of San Diego’s Public Administrator’s Office. It is not every day that she is at Miramar National Cemetery accepting a folded flag for a three-time purple heart recipient, but on a recent late February morning that was exactly what she was doing. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-employees-honor-abandoned-veteran-at-final-resting-place/,2023-03-22T12:08:56-07:00,"
An average day for Tiffany Tsai usually includes some time spent leafing through case files at her desk in the County of San Diego’s Public Administrator’s Office. It is not every day that she is at Miramar National Cemetery accepting a folded flag for a three-time purple heart recipient, but on a recent late February morning that was exactly what she was doing. 

How she came to be there started days earlier when Tsai saw Sgt. William Wilson’s case file. She was impressed by the honors noted in the file and the fact that Sgt. Wilson returned to combat three times even after injuries. 
“I thought it was incredible,” said Tsai, who has been in her position for 8 years. “You hear about a few purple heart recipients here and there but to recover from injuries and return to fight in the Army three times? That is the definition of service above self.”  

Tsai learned that Sgt. Wilson had served in the U.S. Army from 1967-1974, including serving in Vietnam. “I feel most Vietnam Veterans really had it hard,” she said.  
Part of Tsai’s job at the Public Administrator’s Office is to find next of kin for abandoned or homeless veterans after they pass on. Sgt. Wilson was 72 when he died of natural causes in his Oceanside senior living residence. He didn’t leave much behind. She found his parents had passed, he had no known siblings, wasn’t married and had no known children. 

Despite not having next of kin, Tsai thought it vital he receive the honors he earned in service to his country. To ensure Sgt. Wilson received proper honors, she arranged his burial at Miramar National Cemetery. Partridge Creek Mortuary worked with the County’s Public Administrator’s office to provide a beautiful casket at a discount. Additionally, two volunteers donated the funds for a horse-drawn carriage to take Wilson to his final resting place.

Patriot Guard Riders carried his casket and military members dressed in their blues folded the flag. They handed the flag to Tsai.  
“We’re here to take care of our neighbors and ensure they are treated the same way we would want our family treated, all the way to their final resting place,” she said. 
Two of her coworkers, Beatriz Blevins and Margarita Brokaw, made it a priority to attend as well.  

Tsai still has Sgt. Wilson’s flag, displayed neatly on her desk and considers it a privilege to have done her small part in honoring Sgt. Wilson’s service. 
The Public Administrator‘s Office handles estates of people who die with no will or without an appropriate person to act as an administrator. They protect the person’s property from waste, loss or theft and ensure their wishes regarding their disposition and belongings are followed after passing. Each year the Public Administrator’s Office handles approximately 2,259 cases on average. Additionally, the office receives an average of 1,185 referrals each year.

County Animal Services shelters are feeling the wealth of dazzling huskies. So, San Diego County, season 2 of Real Huskies is back with this year’s cast of aspiring housedogs who have fabulous personalities, unlike some of those other shows’ casts.
The hot gossip is that San Diego County Department of Animal Services has the most glamorous and dashing huskies in this part of Southern California – with the least drama, and they are ready to be adopted just like last year’s cast.
Huskies are an active breed that are always up for fun and adventure. To avoid any outrageous behavior, they need daily exercise and activities. Without it, well, they might just find other ways to entertain themselves that could be considered scandalous. Huskies also need regular brushing to reduce shedding and keep their coats looking shiny and gorgeous.
They only look expensive but they’re actually very down-to-earth and, in a case where a dog has been at the shelter for more than 6 months, adoption fees are waived, even non huskies, at both the Bonita shelter and the Carlsbad shelter.
Meet this season’s husky cast of characters all checked in at the Bonita shelter:





 


And they also know how to mingle and get along, check out scenes at the end of article of an exclusive black-and-white party featuring the cast.

1288,"Friday is World Tuberculosis Day, Get Tested, Be Safe",County public health officials are encouraging at-risk San Diegans to get simple blood or skin tests to find out if they may unknowingly have a tuberculosis infection as the world observes World Tuberculosis Day Friday.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/friday-is-world-tuberculosis-day-get-tested-be-safe/,2023-03-22T16:48:55-07:00,"
County public health officials are encouraging at-risk San Diegans to get simple blood or skin tests to find out if they may unknowingly have a tuberculosis infection as the world observes World Tuberculosis Day Friday.
Public health officials estimate that 175,000 San Diegans could be walking around with a hidden—but curable—tuberculosis (TB) infection. People with “latent” TB infections have no symptoms and cannot infect others.
However, if that person’s immune system weakens, the infection can be triggered into a dangerous, highly infectious active TB disease that could make them, their family, friends and even strangers seriously ill.
Officials said people can remedy that by just getting simple blood or skin tests and antibiotic treatments if needed.
“Knowing your risk for tuberculosis can help you protect yourself and your loved ones,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “If you’re at risk, testing now will help you get treated early, before the disease has a chance to make you sick and infect others.”
World Tuberculosis Day is held every March 24 to remind people that the highly infectious bacterial disease passed from an infected person to others through coughing, sneezing, laughing or breathing can be eliminated in our modern world.
Despite the fact it is preventable, TB is the 13th leading cause of death worldwide and the second deadliest infectious disease on earth, behind COVID-19, according to the World Health Organization.
In 2020, the County launched the San Diego County TB Elimination Initiative, a public-private partnership, to promote TB awareness and improve testing and treatment.
People can become infected with “latent” TB and carry it for years without knowing it. That is because their healthy immune systems suppress the infection.
But if their immune systems become weakened by other chronic illnesses, conditions and medications, the latent TB infection they’ve carried can activate even after years of dormancy into active TB disease. That puts themselves and everyone they contact at risk.
Peoples’ immune systems can be weakened by numerous illnesses and conditions including asthma, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, arthritis, and kidney disease, and habits like alcohol abuse, smoking or even getting older.
County officials say without treatment, as many as 10% of all people with latent tuberculosis will develop active tuberculosis disease. Of the 175,000 San Diegans estimated to have latent tuberculosis, officials say only 25% know they have it and only 15% have been treated.
Public health officials say certain groups of people are at higher risk for TB. That includes people who have lived or worked in certain communal settings, such as public shelters and jails, and people born outside of the United States. County officials say 70% of people diagnosed with active tuberculosis disease were born outside of the U.S.
In San Diego County in 2022, 208 people were reported with active TB disease. Active TB disease mainly infects peoples’ lungs. It can cause long-lasting bad coughs, chest pain, coughing up blood, weakness, fatigue, weight loss, fever, chills, night sweats—and even death.
It is especially important for people who have symptoms of active tuberculosis, such as bad coughs that last longer than three weeks, to be tested for tuberculosis.
County officials urge at-risk San Diegans to know their own potential risk, get tested if they have risk factors. People can use the County’s Tuberculosis Control Program’s Risk Assessment tool that is available on their website at: TB Risk Assessment (sandiegocounty.gov)
“We want people to know today on World Tuberculosis Day that you can cure this serious infection, whether you are sick with active tuberculosis disease, or if you have latent tuberculosis and don’t know it,” said Dr. Jeffrey Percak, the chief/medical director of the County’s Tuberculosis Control and Refugee Health Branch. “Those cures start by knowing your risks and getting a blood test or skin test to find out if you are infected.”
So this year, observe World Tuberculosis Day; know your risk; get tested. And be safe.

“You may not even know that you are infected with syphilis and unknowingly pass it on to your unborn child,” said County Public Health Officer Wilma J. Wooten, M.D., M.P.H. “This disease can kill your child or lead to a lifetime of serious health problems. But congenital syphilis is also almost completely preventable.”
County STD Controller and Public Health Medical Officer, Winston Tilghman, M.D. said “All pregnant people should get a blood test for syphilis, and be treated with penicillin injections if needed, in their first prenatal care visit and again during the third trimester. Testing at delivery is also recommended if they’re at risk for getting infected or were not screened earlier in pregnancy.”
Congenital syphilis is syphilis passed from parent to child during pregnancy. It can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight and death shortly after birth.  Infected children who survive birth can suffer among other illnesses, deformed bones, severe anemia, enlarged livers or spleens, and brain and nerve problems like blindness or deafness.
Federal, State, and Local Statistics
Congenital syphilis cases have jumped dramatically in recent years. Nationally, congenital syphilis rates have increased every year since 2013 and there were 2,148 cases and 149 deaths in 2020 alone. From 2016 to 2020, the most recent year of available data, California cases increased 126%, from 214 cases to 483 cases. Over that same period 146 babies died statewide.
Congenital syphilis cases in San Diego County have gradually increased in recent years. There were 15 cases in 2018, 21 in 2019, 14 in 2020 and 30 in in 2021. However, any congenital syphilis case is tragic because it can be completely avoided with timely testing and treatment before or during pregnancy. From 2013 to 2021, there were 10 syphilitic stillbirths reported in San Diego County.
What Is Syphilis? 
Syphilis is a bacterial disease that is mainly transmitted from person to person through sexual contact. But syphilis can also be transmitted from infected pregnant persons to unborn children during pregnancy, or to infants during activities like breast-feeding. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state syphilis in early stages can cause ulcer-like sores called chancres that can occur in, on, or around the penis, vagina, anus, rectum, lips or mouth. These sores are often painless and may go unnoticed. In mid stages it can cause rashes, and possibly other symptoms that mimic other common diseases. Those can include, among other symptoms, fever, swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, headaches, fatigue and muscle aches.
However, syphilis can be also dormant in infected people for years. While people who have had syphilis for over a year are not able to pass on the infection to others through sexual contact, syphilis can be transmitted from a pregnant person to a fetus during at any stage of the infection. The risk is particularly high for people who get syphilis while they are pregnant.
The only sure way for pregnant people to tell if they are infected with syphilis is to get a blood test.
Get Tested 
Public health officials and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommend that anyone who is pregnant or considering becoming pregnant should be tested for syphilis. State and national guidelines recommend people be tested at least twice during pregnancy—at their very first prenatal visit and early in their third trimester, ideally between 28 and 32 weeks. More testing may be recommended at the time of delivery.
Get Treated
Again, syphilis can be treated and cured with antibiotics—even during pregnancy. Pregnant people who test positive should receive penicillin injections. And their sexual partners should also be tested and treated to prevent being re-infected.
The County Health and Human Services Agency’s HIV, Sexually Transmitted Disease (STD) and hepatitis branch are working with California Chapter 3 of the American Academy of Pediatrics to increase awareness of congenital syphilis and how to prevent it with funding from the state department of public health.
More information about syphilis and congenital syphilis can be found at the CDC’s website. For more information about the community education campaign and resources about congenital syphilis, go to the American Academy of Pediatrics website.

1290,"County, State Address Wage Theft Crisis",The County and the State of California are joining forces to fight a wage theft crisis that costs local employees millions of dollars.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-state-address-wage-theft-crisis/,2023-03-23T16:06:49-07:00,"
The County and the State of California are joining forces to fight a wage theft crisis that costs local employees millions of dollars.
In honor of labor rights activist César Chávez, the County’s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement (OLSE) and the State of California’s Labor Commissioner’s Office announced Thursday they’re stepping up efforts to help workers get the pay they’re due.
Board Vice Chair Terra Lawson-Remer said workers can’t always fight wage theft themselves because they’re too busy trying to take care of their families. But said these workers have an ally at the County.
She pointed to the new Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement and a proposed wage theft fund.
She said it’s about fairness and she had a message for every honest San Diego business.
“These rules help you because unscrupulous employers who cheat their employees have an unfair advantage and honest companies can’t compete. So together we can change that,” said Vice Chair Terra Lawson Remer.
The DA’s office opened a Workplace Justice Division in 2021 and learned from the community that when it comes to wage theft, people don’t really know it’s a crime.
“When your wages are stolen, if they’re under $950 that is still a crime, a misdemeanor crime,” said District Attorney Summer Stephan. “But if it’s over $950, that’s a felony crime that your DA’s office is going to bring and there’s real accountability.”
The state is also making changes to make sure workers know their rights especially those in underserved communities. It launched an outreach campaign called “Reaching Every Californian.”
“We need to get out of our offices and go out into the community and meet workers where they are. All workers, not just workers who know their rights…” said Lilia García-Brower, Labor Commissioner of the California Department of Industrial Relations. “…It is our obligation to get to them because if workers don’t understand their rights, how are they going to exercise them? So outreach is foundational to enforcement.”
The Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement reaches out to educate workers and businesses countywide on their rights and responsibilities, too.
“We’ve also created the Fair Place Collaborative bringing together both businesses and worker advocacy organizations and stakeholders to help chart the course for our office,” said Brandon Butler, Deputy Director, County’s Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement. “We developed new policies with our County Department of Purchasing and Contracting to implement anti wage theft rules within our key contracting procedures. And we also ensured that County contract vendors comply with workers’ rights laws here in the county.”
During Thursday’s event, a proclamation was presented to a close County partner, the director of the Employee Rights Center, Alor Calderon. The news conference also kicked off a Week of Action designed to educate people about workers’ rights.
For additional information on workers’ rights and how to file a claim, you can reach the County Office of Labor Standards and Enforcement through its advice line at 619-985-1597 or at OLSE@sdcounty.ca.gov.

1292,Bite-Sized Tips for National Nutrition Month,"March is National Nutrition Month, an annual month of action that promotes healthy habits and food choices. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/bite-sized-tips-for-national-nutrition-month/,2023-03-27T10:23:42-07:00,"
March is National Nutrition Month, an annual month of action that promotes healthy habits and food choices. 
This year’s theme, “Fuel for the Future” embodies why good nutrition is essential at every stage of life and lowers the risk for serious health problems like heart disease, type 2 diabetes and obesity.  
Three behaviors including poor nutrition, tobacco use and lack of physical activity contribute to four chronic diseases that cause 45 percent of all deaths in San Diego County. 
“We have probably all heard the saying, ‘you are what you eat’.  It is very true because our overall health may be largely determined by the nutrients we consume,” explained County Public Health Services Registered Dietitian, Barbara L. Hughes, MS, RD, CalFresh Healthy Living Program Nutrition Policy Advisor. “National Nutrition Month is a great opportunity to think about the foods and beverages you consume and learn about the easy changes we can all make to ensure we are choosing foods that contribute to our overall well-being.” 
Hughes recommends choosing nutrient-dense foods that include vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy, proteins and oils and reducing foods that are higher in added sugars, saturated and trans fats and sodium. 
Other tips include: 

Add color to your plate: Colorful fruits and vegetables have vitamins, minerals and dietary fiber. The goal is to make half your plate a colorful mix of produce. 
Plan your meals: Having a plan for the week can help you make healthier choices and ensure you are including a variety of different foods in your diet, while repurposing leftover ingredients.  
Pack your snacks: Healthy snacks between meals can help keep your energy levels up while adding extra nutrients to your overall diet.  
Get cooking: Making your food at home is often a healthier option than eating out because you can control the ingredients you put into your meals. Plus, cooking at home can be rewarding and cost-effective.
Watch for added sugar: Some foods and drinks can contain added sugar that provides no nutritional benefit. Try choosing drinks and foods that do not add unnecessary sugars. 
Change things up: Experiment with trying new foods like ancient grains, meatless options or new-to-you vegetables. Try a variety of foods from all food groups.  

If food affordability is an issue, food assistance may be available through CalFresh, also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).  Visit San Diego County’s CalFresh website to learn more or call the Access line at 1-866-262-9881. You can also visit a local Family Resource Center to get assistance.  
More nutrition tips, healthy recipes, along with food and nutrition resources can be found on the EatFresh website.

1293,VIDEO: Lakeside Community Celebrates Grand Opening of New Library Branch,The new Lakeside Library branch is now open for business.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/lakeside-community-celebrates-grand-opening-of-new-library-branch/,2023-03-27T16:26:02-07:00,"
The new Lakeside Library branch is now open for business. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the grand opening took place over the weekend.
The event featured music, art displays, activities and crafts for kids and adults. Community members were also invited to tour the new 16,800 square foot library on Woodside Ave. and learn more about its design features, including the themed Children’s Area and Teen Space that feature age-appropriate books and fun spaces to hang out.
The new branch is more than three times larger than the prior facility on Vine St. and includes meeting spaces, a 2,000 square foot community room, 3D printing capabilities, a Vet Connect station to link veterans to resources through the Office of Military and Veterans Affairs, and a Friends of the Library bookstore.
The new Lakeside library was designed as a Zero Net Energy building, meaning the energy needed to operate the building is completely offset by solar power. There are also three biofiltration basins on site that collect all the water that falls onto the building’s roof, the surrounding sidewalks, and the parking lot when it rains.
The building also features LED lighting, which uses significantly less electricity than traditional light bulbs and the landscaping surrounding the new library incorporates native and drought-tolerant plants.
Construction started in July 2021 and was completed earlier this year.

1294,VIDEO: Casa Anita Offers a Place to Call Home for People Experiencing Homelessness,"The County is celebrating another grand opening of an affordable housing development, this time in Chula Vista.

The County is celebrating another grand opening of an affordable housing development, this time in Chula Vista. The Casa Anita Apartments have 96 new units dedicated to people and families experiencing homelessness including those diagnosed with a serious mental illness. The County partnered with Wakeland Housing and Development on the project and invested $10 million through the No Place Like Home program and Innovative Housing Trust Fund. And despite a pandemic, international supply shortages and even torrential rains… Casa Anita is ready for its new residents.
The County of San Diego Housing and Community Development Services (HCDS) helps more than 53,800 people live in safe affordable housing. The department maintains more than 6,600 affordable units in 142 developments throughout the County, with more than 14,500 people calling this housing, home. Currently, HCDS is helping fund 16 developments under construction, totaling 1,244 units. In addition, there are 22 developments on the horizon, bringing a total of 3,144 units actively under construction or in the works.
These and other endeavors are part of the County’s ongoing response to the region’s housing affordability crisis. Efforts are underway to create a roadmap, or Housing Blueprint, to guide our ongoing response. Community input has been vital to the County’s efforts to address the crisis to date and is encouraged to help inform final recommendations for the Blueprint’s goals and objectives and be presented to the Board of Supervisors.

1297,County Now Offering Free Graffiti Removal for Property Owners in the Unincorporated Area,A new County program now in place allows San Diegans in the county's unincorporated area to remove unwanted graffiti from their property free of charge.,https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-now-offering-free-graffiti-removal-for-property-owners-in-the-unincorporated-area/,2023-03-30T10:30:57-07:00,"
A new County program now in place allows San Diegans in the county’s unincorporated area to remove unwanted graffiti from their property free of charge.
The Board approved the initiative in January. The first graffiti abatement occurred last week when contractors removed extensive graffiti damage from the side of a building along Campo Rd. in Spring Valley.
The previous policy required the property owner to pay graffiti removal costs. Under the new program, residents in the unincorporated area can schedule the graffiti removal through the County, and a contractor will remove the unwanted graffiti free of charge.
The initiative aims to beautify the region without placing a financial burden on property owners. Close to 90 percent of graffiti cases are reported in areas of the region where residents often struggle to pay the removal cost.
If you want to report a graffiti issue in the unincorporated area, there are several ways to do so:

Download the Tell Us Now App from the Google Play Store or Apple Store
Call the 24/7 hotline at (858) 694-2705
Email PDS.CodeCompliance@sdcounty.ca.gov
Report the issue in person at the County Operations Center – 5510 Overland Ave., Suite 300

1299,County Kicks Off 39th Annual Blood Drive,"One in seven people entering a hospital needs blood. Even more urgent, blood banks supplying those hospitals are often faced with shortages.  ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/county-kicks-off-39th-annual-blood-drive/,2023-04-03T16:03:43-07:00,"
One in seven people entering a hospital needs blood. Even more urgent, blood banks supplying those hospitals are often faced with shortages.  
That is why for 39 years, the County has hosted an annual blood drive to meet the critical need for donations.  
This year’s month-long event kicked off Monday, outside the County Administration Center, with Chief Medical Officer Eric McDonald describing the importance both donating and creating diversity among donors. 
“We don’t have to look far to find someone we know in need of blood. My mother needed a transfusion, and we are thankful to blood donors who made it possible for her to be here with us today,” said Dr. McDonald. “It is important for those who have donated, and for those who haven’t, to step forward to provide a diverse blood pool. Certain blood types and surface proteins are unique to specific groups and if you have someone with a similar ethnic background, a blood transfusion is less likely to cause a reaction.” 
To help spur regional donations, the County partnered last year with the San Diego Blood Bank, a Live Well San Diego partner, to create the Community Guardians Program. The project is dedicated to promoting and expanding blood donations.  
The County drive is one of the largest and most successful collection events organized by the San Diego Blood Bank. Everyone is welcome, including non-County employees, to sign up to donate.

1300,Taking Action to Strengthen Families During Child Abuse Prevention Month,"In honor of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, San Diego County Child Welfare Services (CWS) is joining partners this April to raise awareness through activities that support child abuse prevention. ",https://www.countynewscenter.com/taking-action-to-strengthen-families-during-child-abuse-prevention-month/,2023-04-04T08:38:54-07:00,"
In honor of National Child Abuse Prevention Month, San Diego County Child Welfare Services (CWS) is joining partners this April to raise awareness through activities that support child abuse prevention. 
Among the partners in the collaboration are the YMCA of San Diego County, Rady Children’s Hospital, Palomar Health, the San Diego County Office of Education (SDCOE), Promises2Kids and the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office who are partnering to support families and build upon the strengths of parents to care for their children safely. 
From July 2021 to June 2022, CWS received more than 39,000 reports of alleged abuse and neglect, representing 67,824 children.  
“The regional commitment to ensuring children throughout San Diego County grow up safe and nurtured is strong, as evidenced by the collaboration of these organizations,” said Dr. Kimberly Giardina, CWS director. “Every person in the region can play a role by joining us in connecting families to strengthening services that can keep them together.” 
Get involved this April:

1301,San Diego County Board of Supervisors Approve Anti-Tobacco Grant Funding,"Strengthening efforts to prevent youth smoking, today the San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved the acceptance of more than $1.6 million in funding from the California Department of Justice Tobacco Grant Program. The grant will fund enforcement-related activities ensuring businesses in unincorporated San Diego County follow the proper protocols required to maintain their license to sell tobacco products.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/san-diego-county-board-of-supervisors-approve-tobacco-grant-funding/,2023-04-04T12:03:50-07:00,"
Strengthening efforts to prevent youth smoking, today the San Diego County Board of Supervisors approved the acceptance of more than $1.6 million in funding from the California Department of Justice Tobacco Grant Program. The grant will fund enforcement-related activities ensuring businesses in unincorporated San Diego County follow the proper protocols required to maintain their license to sell tobacco products. 
The funds will be distributed over three years, ultimately reducing the opportunity for kids to illegally purchase tobacco products. The money will allow more staff to conduct decoy operations to test tobacco retailers, ensuring they do not sell to youth or sell flavored tobacco products. It will also provide educational outreach to businesses. 
“This funding is vital to continue work to reduce smoking and protect the next generation of San Diegans,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., M.P.H., County public health officer. “Smoking is one of three behaviors that lead to a significant number of deaths in our community, and we want to do everything in our power to keep children and others from becoming addicted.” 
All eligible businesses were visited at least once during fiscal year 2021-2022 and more than 80% were out of compliance at the first visit. More than half sold tobacco products to an underage decoy and nearly a third sold prohibited items or were not following the minimum price or minimum pack size requirements. 
The funding will also go toward developing a new data management system to track license applications, payments and level of compliance. It will also be used to create a multi-agency tobacco retail licensing task force to identify and address local enforcement issues. 
The funding comes as smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, including in California. In 2022 the County of San Diego lost 4,000 people to smoking-related illnesses. This is one of three behaviors that contribute to four chronic conditions resulting in nearly half of all deaths in San Diego County, also known as the 3-4-45 principle. This is a significant stride compared to 20 years ago. To date, and due in part to the County’s efforts, the region has seen a 17 percent reduction in the percentage of deaths associated with preventable death threats. Tuesday’s approval is another step toward building a healthier San Diego where everyone has the opportunity to Live Well.

1302,TB Exposure Affects Multiple Services at Father Joe’s Villages,"The Tuberculosis Control program (TB Control) in the Public Health Services department, of the County of San Diego (County) Health and Human Services Agency, and Father Joe’s Villages officials are working in close collaboration to notify staff, volunteers, and clients potentially exposed to tuberculosis  (TB) at various Father Joe’s Villages Programs.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/tb-exposure-affects-multiple-services-at-father-joes-villages/,2023-04-04T15:24:10-07:00,"
The Tuberculosis Control program (TB Control) in the Public Health Services department, of the County of San Diego (County) Health and Human Services Agency, and Father Joe’s Villages officials are working in close collaboration to notify staff, volunteers, and clients potentially exposed to tuberculosis (TB) at various Father Joe’s Villages Programs. These include the Inclement Weather Shelter, San Diego Day Center, Food Services, Employment and Education Services, and Village Health Center.
The dates of potential exposure are from January 14, 2023, to March 3, 2023.
TB is an airborne disease that is transmitted from person-to-person through inhalation of the bacteria from the air. The bacteria are spread when someone sick with TB coughs, speaks, sings, or breathes. People with frequent and prolonged indoor exposure to a person who is sick with TB should get tested.
People experiencing homelessness are at increased risk for TB for a variety of reasons. These include a higher risk for getting infected in congregate settings, challenges regarding access to healthcare for people experiencing homelessness, and the presence of certain medical conditions that may be more common and/or severe among people experiencing homelessness.
While the rate of TB is much higher among people who have experienced homelessness, among people with TB disease in San Diego County, 90% of people who are diagnosed with TB have not been recently homeless. Health concerns like TB highlight the importance of work being done by organizations in the region, like Father Joe’s Villages, that work to address the challenges faced by people experiencing homelessness.
“Symptoms of active TB include persistent cough, fever, night sweats and unexplained weight loss,” said Wilma Wooten, M.D., County public health officer. “Most people who become infected after exposure to tuberculosis do not get sick right away. This is called latent TB infection. Some who become infected with tuberculosis will become ill in the future, sometimes even years later, if their latent TB infection is not treated. Blood tests and skin tests are effective to determine whether someone has been infected.”
Effective treatments are available to cure people who are sick from active TB. It is especially important for individuals with symptoms of active TB and those who are immune compromised to see a medical provider to rule out active TB and to discuss treatment.
People who test positive for TB but who don’t have symptoms of active TB should get a chest x-ray and talk to a medical provider, as they most likely have a latent TB infection.  People in this situation are infected with TB, but the infection is essentially dormant or “sleeping.” Taking medicines for latent TB infection can cure the infection and keep these people from getting sick.

1303,Ag Pass Offers Help During Disaster,"Disasters and wildfires threaten lives and businesses in San Diego County each year.  Often people are forced to gather up their most important possessions and evacuate to safety.

Disasters and wildfires threaten lives and businesses in San Diego County each year.  Often people are forced to gather up their most important possessions and evacuate to safety. But commercial livestock operations may be too large to evacuate all their animals immediately and need to return as quickly as possible to care for animals. Farmers also must abandon their operation, leaving crops and critical infrastructure unattended for extended periods. Now, operators can apply for an Agricultural and Livestock Pass (Ag Pass) program to return to an evacuated area to help when the threat diminishes.
When a mandatory evacuation order is given, all people, including Ag Pass holders, must evacuate. When fire and law enforcement leaders allow, Ag Pass holders will be able to return to the area to move, feed and provide veterinary care of livestock, or work on irrigation systems, farm equipment and other essential infrastructure.
Ag Pass access is limited to daylight hours and doesn’t guarantee entry to an evacuated area.  Fire and law enforcement officials make the decision for entry based on fire behavior and public safety.
To take advantage of the program, commercial operators and managerial employees must attend a four-hour fire safety training and take annual refresher training. To date, 76 Ag Pass identification cards have been issued to individuals at 28 companies in the unincorporated areas of the County.
The pilot program started last year was limited to cattle and equine operations. Tuesday, Supervisors approved the immediate rollout of full implementation of the Ag Pass program, offering access to more than four thousand commercial agriculture and livestock operators in the unincorporated area.

There are 96 new affordable housing options for families and individuals in San Diego County. A grand opening celebration was held today for the Amanecer Apartments on Ulric Street in Linda Vista. The Community HousingWorks development features apartments large enough for families with some units reserved for foster youth and unhoused veterans. The County invested $7 million dollars of Innovative Housing Trust Funds in the project and helped welcome these new residents home.
San Diego County Housing and Community Development Services helps more than 53,800 people through various housing programs and affordable housing efforts. Since 2017, the County has invested more than $240 million in affordable housing, including using County excess property and its Innovative Housing Trust Fund. Efforts since then have resulted in the opening of 1,125 new units with an additional 3,144 units on the way. When upcoming developments under construction or in planning are complete, the total number of affordable units supported by the County will reach nearly 7,600, providing homes to more than 16,700 people.
These and other endeavors are part of the County’s ongoing response to the region’s housing affordability crisis. Efforts also are underway to create a roadmap, or Housing Blueprint, to guide our ongoing response. Community input remains vital to the County’s efforts to address the crisis to date. People are encouraged to review the Housing Blueprint to help inform final recommendations for its goals and objectives before it is presented later this year to the Board of Supervisors.

1307,Building a County Budget for All – A Step-by-step Process,"If it’s spring, then it’s high budget season at the County. Preparations are in full swing for a May 4 release to the public.",https://www.countynewscenter.com/building-a-county-budget-for-all-a-step-by-step-process/,2023-04-13T09:32:02-07:00,"
If it’s spring, then it’s high budget season at the County. Preparations are in full swing for a May 4 release to the public.
Staff began preparing the new two-year budget in February but now it’s crunch time. After examining the data, considering community feedback, and pinpointing funding priorities, a balanced recommended budget must be compiled for review by the Chief Administrative Office for release in early May.
That’s about three weeks away, which may seem like quite a bit of time, but the County budget is no small matter. Last year, the budget for Fiscal Year 2022-23 came to $7.36 billion.
Everything the County does for the region’s residents must be considered with equity and justice in mind. And it’s built on community input from various events, surveys and online opportunities throughout the year.
So, what does the County budget cover? In the unincorporated areas, the County provides things a city typically would, like roads, parks, libraries and more.
But regionwide, the County has even larger responsibilities. For example, it provides services for mental health and substance use issues and provides food and medical assistance to those who need them. The County addresses homelessness and affordable housing, monitors public health for disease outbreaks and inspects restaurants, buildings, gas stations, price scanners, harmful insects, and beach water.
The District Attorney’s Office, Probation, Office of Emergency Services and Child Support provide services to the entire county too. The Sheriff’s Department oversees the unincorporated area but is also paid by some cities for law enforcement. The County runs elections, collects property taxes, keeps vital records and the list goes on.
Funding must support all existing programs and cover new ones. Where does the money for the budget come from? A large share comes from the state and federal government. But those tax dollars must be spent on certain programs. Some money comes in from property taxes, fees for services and other sources.
Once the state and federal dollars are accounted for, the County looks at what funds are left to spend and considers how to get the most out of the remaining tax dollars.
County staff did all the legwork preparing a recommended budget, but residents get a say, too. Once the recommended budget is released, the public can submit comments online.
But that’s not the end of it. You can give your feedback, either at community meetings on May 16 and May 18, or by attending or calling into the Board of Supervisors budget meetings. A list of key days and times is listed on our open budget website. You’ll also see last year’s adopted budget.
This year, departments will give their budget presentations to the Board of Supervisors at a meeting on May 11. The Board will hold public hearings on June 12 and June 15. A revised recommended budget comes out on June 23, and budget deliberations and adoption take place on June 27.
In the meantime, the County wants to know how to keep you informed as it moves along the budget process. Do you prefer email, text or some other form of communication? Visit the budget page on Engage San Diego County and give us your ideas. Starting May 4 through June 21, you can leave your e-Comments on the budget at the same site.
The County’s Engage San Diego County webpage was created to make it easier for the public to be involved in the planning process of County projects and initiatives. People can find information about active and upcoming public projects, forums and links to numerous ways to take part and weigh in on those projects.
You can also visit the Clerk of the Board’s website or call 619-531-5434 to get details about the Board’s budget meetings and request translation services.

The County of San Diego joined multiple partners today in breaking ground on a 70-unit affordable housing development for families in Carlsbad. 

The $36 million Aviara Development will provide housing for low-income families, with 1-3 bedroom floorplans. The County Housing and Community Development Services Department invested $1.3 million through its HOME Investment Partnerships Program which is designed to increase affordable housing for low-income households. 
“Partnering to build affordable housing is more important than ever, across our entire region,” said Nick Macchione, director of Health and Human Services. “Last week we opened affordable housing for families in San Marcos on Thursday, and broke ground on a downtown midrise for seniors Friday. The County is creating and preserving affordable housing at a pace I’ve not seen in my career, and it’s exciting to be part of keeping that momentum.”  
Aviara is a development of Bridge Housing. Information on how to sign up for updates on the development, including when a waiting list will be established, is available on the nonprofit builder’s website. 

San Diego County Housing and Community Development Services provides affordable housing opportunities to more than 40,000 people each year, through various housing programs and affordable housing efforts. Since 2017, the County has invested more than $240 million in affordable housing, including using County excess property and its Innovative Housing Trust Fund.

1310,County Keeps Child Safety Paramount During Child Abuse Awareness Month,"A colorful pinwheel garden served as the backdrop today for a Child Abuse Awareness press conference at the County Administration Center downtown.

A colorful pinwheel garden served as the backdrop today for a Child Abuse Awareness press conference at the County Administration Center downtown. Chairwoman Nora Vargas, County Child Welfare Services and Promises2Kids teamed up for the event to help raise awareness and prevent child abuse.
Each week, an average of 400 active investigations of alleged child abuse and neglect are initiated in San Diego County. An estimated five children die every day in the United States as a result of child abuse or neglect. When families experience at least one material hardship, the likelihood of being investigated or neglect increases nearly three times.
The good news is child abuse and neglect are preventable.
“For me, making sure that the children and families of San Diego County are taken care of is one of my top priorities and I absolutely believe that prevention is key,” Chairwoman Nora Vargas said.
With that goal in mind, the County also has created a new Child and Family Well-Being Department, combining prevention and protective services. This new department will focus on supporting and strengthening families first to make sure they have the resources they need before a crisis strikes. By prioritizing prevention, the hope is children and youth won’t ever need to enter the child welfare service system.
“Locally, here in San Diego, we receive about 40,000 calls to our child abuse hotline and last year that represented almost 68,000 children here in our community that people were concerned are being abused or neglected in their homes,” said Director Kim Giardina, with the Child Welfare Services.
Every child deserves a chance to succeed and grow up in a safe, stable, and nurturing environment that is free from abuse and neglect. If you have reason to believe a child you know is experiencing abuse or neglect, contact the County’s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or 800-344-6000. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego, or check this website for a variety of resources related to child abuse prevention.

The County wants to hear from you on a new report with recommendations for programs and services to redirect people contacted for low level charges away from jails when there is not a threat to public safety. A virtual community listening session on the report will take place on May 4, 2023 at 5:30 p.m. There are a number of other ways to comment including via comment card and or through public comment on the report during the May 23 Board of Supervisors meeting when the final report will be presented to the Board.
On April 25, 2023, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) released its final report outlining “A Data-Driven Approach to Protecting Public Safety,” the fifth and final installment of a project that aims to identify alternatives to incarceration in San Diego County.  The report looks at booking trends in County jails, analyzes data to answer the question of why the jail population dropped during the pandemic and interviews community stakeholders to assess how to meet the needs of at-risk individuals. The final report summarizes all information compiled for this project since 2021 and outlines 52 final recommendations drawn from data analysis and input from the project advisory group, working group and community members.
Some recommendations made in the report include:

Increase the array of housing options for justice-involved individuals experiencing homelessness and reduce barriers to access, while ensuring that additional needs can be met concurrently.
Consider additional booking alternatives that increase connection to services and resources for individuals who have contact with law enforcement and for those exiting detention facilities.
Build capacity for expansion and regionalization of sobering services.
Ensure individuals are released from custody in ways that support successful reentry.
Work to meet the health, behavioral health, and housing needs of the most vulnerable individuals both during and after incarceration.
Nurture an environment where there is an openness to objectively evaluate statistics and a constant desire for program improvement.

A link to the full report can be found on the Alternatives to Incarceration project site.
Community input is critical to informing the direction of the Alternatives to Incarceration project and will help the County ensure that the ongoing project responds to the needs of the community.

Nationwide, 3 million cases of child abuse are reported yearly. In San Diego, the County’s Child Welfare Services (CWS) received 39,000 calls to the child abuse hotline last year that represented almost 68,000 children. 
“Child abuse and neglect are serious issues that we are working together as a community to tackle,” said Kimberly Giardina, CWS director. “Today is really an important day to raise awareness about the ongoing need for child abuse prevention and the things that each one of us can do to help children in our community.”
Child Abuse Prevention Month, which is commemorated every April, aims to spread the word about what everyone can do to prevent child abuse including how to recognize signs of abuse and neglect and get connected to community resources.  
If you suspect a child is experiencing abuse or neglect, contact the County’s Child Abuse Hotline at 858-560-2191 or (800) 344-6000. You can also call 2-1-1 San Diego, or check the Child Welfare Services website for a variety of resources related to child abuse prevention.

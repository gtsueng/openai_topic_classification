I have metadata associated with a public service announcement quoted here: 

"\nAn additional COVID-19 death was reported in San Diego, bringing the region\u2019s total to 17, the County Health and Human Services Agency announced today.\n\u201cCOVID-19 is in our neighborhoods and communities and, unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths,\u201d said Wilma Wooten, County public health officer, adding that the new death is a man in his late 70s. \u201cPeople who are not essential workers should remain at home to decrease their chances of contracting the virus and passing it to others, especially people at higher risk of having severe complications from COVID-19.\u201d\nCounty health officials continue to strongly encourage San Diegans to wear a facial covering when out in public conducting essential activities. The cloth facial coverings don\u2019t have to be hospital grade but should cover the nose and mouth. Homemade masks, bandanas, scarves and neck gaiters are acceptable, since these items can be washed and reused. Facial coverings don\u2019t need to be used when people are at home. First 5 San Diego compiled a list of guides for making your own covering.\nGuidance for Businesses\nStarting April 4, all employees who work in the following businesses must wear facial coverings if they have contact with the public:\n\nSupermarkets and grocery stores\nRestaurants\nPharmacies\nConvenience stores\nGas stations\n\nAlso, all businesses in the region must display their social distancing and sanitation protocol. A template is available on coronavirus-sd.com. The protocol, which should be implemented by April 7, includes:\n\nSignage at each public entrance to inform all employees and customers that they should: avoid entering the facility if they have a cough or fever; maintain a minimum six-foot distance from one another and not shake hands or engage in any unnecessary physical contact.\nDisplay a copy of the Social Distancing Protocol at each public entrance to the facility.\nBusinesses must make sure every employee who can carry out their work duties from home has been directed to do so. All employees have been told not to come to work, if sick.\nAll desks or individual workstations are separated by at least six feet.\nBreak rooms, bathrooms, and other common areas are disinfected frequently.\n\n\u201cAll these measures are necessary to protect the health of your employees and everyone around them,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cThese aggressive measures are necessary to keep people from contracting COVID-19 and spreading the virus to others.\u201d\nCOVID-19 Health Order Being Enforced\nThe County\u2019s health order has also been amended to include the following: boating for recreational purposes, outdoor water sports, swimming and surfing in public waterways or beaches are prohibited.\nLaw enforcement agencies throughout the region will be out making sure that people who are in public are conducting essential activities and to keep people from being out in groups, especially if they are not members of the same family or household.\nThey will also be investigating essential businesses that are not following the new facial covering or social distancing guidance. People are encouraged to call their local police department\u2019s non-emergency line or visit 2-1-1 San Diego to report businesses not in compliances.\nResidents who disobey the essential business guideline or who are in groups in public are subject to a misdemeanor ticket. Penalties can be up to a $1,000 fine or 6 months in jail.\nWhat Do Cases by ZIP Code Really Mean?\nMany people and some media have been questioning what the number of COVID-19 cases by ZIP code really means.\nPublic health officials say the data does not really indicate much, except where the positive cases reside. It does not show where the person contracted the virus. In some instances, the data also includes the ZIP codes of the hospital where patients were tested, especially if the patients did not have an address.\nSan Diegans should know that since there is community spread, it is possible to contract COVID-19 in any region, city, or ZIP code of the county.\u00a0 However, many of the early cases contracted the illness outside of the County.\nAll residents, regardless of where they live, should follow the guidance that has been given. That includes:\n\nWearing a facial covering when in public conducting essential activities; for employees of essential businesses who have contact with the public, this is mandatory.\nMaintaining physical distance \u2013six feet \u2013 from other people.\nWashing hands regularly with soap and water or using hand sanitizer.\nStaying home, especially if they are sick.\nCovering coughs and sneezes.\nNot going out in public in groups, especially if you\u2019re not part of the same household.\n\n\u201cYou should assume anyone around you could have COVID-19 and take appropriate precautions to avoid contracting the virus,\u201d Wooten said.\nCOVID-19 Cases Jump to 1,112\nThrough April 2, a total of 1,112 COVID-19 cases have been reported in San Diego County, including 146 new cases in the last day.\nOf San Diego County\u2019s cases, 52.6% (585) were men and 46.7% (439) were women. The gender of eight people is unknown. Of the known cases, 211 (19%) have required hospitalization and 85 (7.6%) of the total number of cases had to be placed in intensive care.\nCounty officials also talked about other measures and resources to deal with COVID-19. To date:\n\nMore than 15,800 San Diegans have been tested, including 1,882 tests reported April 2.\nThe County has distributed nearly 1.4 million personal protective equipment items to local health care providers, including nearly 594,000 N-95 respirators, more than 234,000 surgical face masks and about 550,000 gloves.\nA total of 2,026 hotel rooms have been secured to isolate people who have potential COVID-19 symptoms and people who have health vulnerabilities and have no place to live.\nOf the 1,585 rooms for County Public Health Services use, 142 are occupied by 146 guests.\nOf the 441 rooms assigned to the Regional Task Force on the Homeless, 179 are being occupied by 302 people who are at higher risk of developing complications from COVID-19.\n\nThe County\u2019s COVID-19 webpage now contains a graph showing new positive cases and total cases reported by date.
